41613379,Dietary and complementary oral supplements for the management of chronic diseases in children: a systematic review.,"Chronic diseases in childhood and adolescence represent a growing global challenge, with families often seeking complementary strategies beyond pharmacological treatment. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dietary and oral supplements in pediatric chronic diseases. The review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library was performed (2005-2025). Eligible studies enrolled children and adolescents (<18 years) with chronic diseases and assessed oral dietary supplements against placebo, standard care, or no intervention. Thirteen studies were included. The studies investigated autism spectrum disorder (ASD), functional gastrointestinal disorders, cystic fibrosis (CF), type 1 diabetes (T1D), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Interventions included probiotics, omega-3/6 fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, glutathione, Kre-Celazine® and Dimercaptosuccinic Acid (DMSA). Most supplements demonstrated measurable bioactivity, such as modulation of the gut microbiota, changes in inflammatory markers, or improvements in functional indices, but clinical benefits were often inconsistent or limited to subgroups. Safety was generally favorable for probiotics, polyunsaturated fatty acids, magnesium, zinc, and vitamin A, whereas DMSA chelation raised significant safety concerns. Dietary and oral supplements show promise as supportive interventions in pediatric chronic diseases but cannot yet be recommended for systematic clinical use. Larger multicenter trials with longer follow-up, standardized endpoints, and predictive biomarkers are needed to identify responder subgroups and establish evidence-based recommendations.",Inchingolo AD; Marinelli G; Limongelli L; Inchingolo F; Favia G; Ferrante L; Di Noia A; Maspero C; Palermo A; Inchingolo AM; Dipalma G,Frontiers in pediatrics,2026,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41613379/,1,0,0,0,0,1
41539774,Legumes and fermented legume products as dietary supplements: a focus on glucose and lipid metabolism mechanisms and product development.,"Glycolipid metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity, and dyslipidemia, are escalating public health concerns worldwide, demanding urgent, sustainable, and safer interventions. While pharmacological therapies are widely used, growing attention is now directed toward preventive and adjunctive strategies that sustainably manage these conditions. Dietary interventions, particularly those involving functional foods, have gained prominence for their potential to prevent and mitigate disease progression. Among these, legumes, including soybeans, lentils, peas, and their fermented products, such as natto and miso, offer notable promise. This review critically examines the molecular mechanisms through which legumes and fermented legumes regulate glucose and lipid metabolism (GLM), highlighting pathways such as AMPK activation, PI3K/Akt modulation, and inflammatory pathway suppression. Legumes exert beneficial effects on GLM by improving insulin sensitivity, modulating lipid profiles, and attenuating chronic inflammation. Fermentation further enhances these benefits by reducing antinutritional factors and generating novel bioactive compounds such as peptides and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) with superior bioavailability. Additionally, we explore the development of legume-based functional foods, including dietary supplements, beverages, and protein powders, analyzing current market examples and technological innovations. Future perspectives emphasize the need for deeper mechanistic studies and the advancement of clinically validated, consumer-acceptable legume-derived functional products to combat metabolic diseases effectively.",Randeni N; Luo J; Xu B,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41539774/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41516172,Modulation of Cardiometabolic Risk by Vitamin D and K2: Simple Supplementation or Real Drug? Uncovering the Pharmacological Properties.,"Vitamin D, traditionally regarded as a nutrient, is increasingly recognized as a pharmacologically active secosteroid with pleiotropic effects extending beyond calcium homeostasis and bone integrity. Together with vitamin K2, it participates in the fine-tuning of mineral metabolism and vascular health, potentially modulating cardiometabolic risk through intertwined endocrine and paracrine pathways. Despite widespread fortification and supplementation, vitamin D deficiency remains a major global health concern, driven by limited sun exposure, obesity, and metabolic dysfunction. Observational and mechanistic studies consistently link low serum 25(OH)D concentrations with hypertension, insulin resistance, heart failure, and increased cardiovascular mortality. At the molecular level, vitamin D exerts pharmacological actions-modulating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, exerting anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects, and influencing endothelial and cardiomyocyte signaling. While experimental and epidemiological evidence suggests potential cardiovascular benefits, large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide conflicting results, particularly regarding hypertension and heart failure. However, these often-neutral results do not preclude a targeted action. On the contrary, clinical efficacy is strongly dependent on baseline deficiency status and the presence of metabolic cofactors. In this context, high-dose supplementation of Vitamin D, in combination with Vitamin K2 to prevent vascular calcification, elevates the supplement to a genuine pharmacological agent, with a distinct therapeutic potential for modulating cardiometabolic risk in selected patient subgroups. Emerging evidence supports the concept that vitamin D, when appropriately dosed and combined with K2, may act more as a low-potency pharmacological modulator than a simple nutritional supplement. This review synthesizes current mechanistic, observational, and interventional evidence, aiming to clarify whether vitamin D should be reclassified-from a micronutrient to a pharmacologically relevant agent-in cardiometabolic prevention and therapy, proposing a paradigm shift toward personalized and targeted dosing strategies, characteristic of precision pharmacology.",D'Elia S; Bottino R; Carbone A; Formisano T; Orlandi M; Sperlongano S; Castaldo P; Molinari D; Palladino A; Morello M; Titolo G; Loffredo FS; Natale F; Cirillo P; Cimmino G,International journal of molecular sciences,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41516172/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41465572,"Sarcopenia in the Aging Process: Pathophysiological Mechanisms, Clinical Implications, and Emerging Therapeutic Approaches.","In the face of population aging, sarcopenia has emerged as a significant muscle disorder characterized by the progressive loss of muscle mass, strength, and function. Chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction contribute to sarcopenia and help explain its association with comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and neurodegenerative diseases. Despite extensive research, there remains a need to integrate current knowledge on interventions that target these interconnected mechanisms. This review synthesizes recent evidence on the effects of resistance exercise, nutritional supplementation (high-protein intake, leucine, vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids), and probiotic use on muscle function and inflammatory status in older adults with sarcopenia. Literature was critically analyzed to evaluate the efficacy of multicomponent strategies. The reviewed studies consistently report that combining resistance training with anti-inflammatory nutrition and targeted supplementation improves muscle strength, reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines, and supports mitochondrial function. These findings suggest that an integrated, multicomponent approach represents a promising strategy for attenuating the progression of sarcopenia and reducing its associated comorbidities.",Araújo LP; Figueiredo Godoy AC; Fortes Frota F; Barbalho Lamas C; Quesada K; Rucco Penteado Detregiachi C; Cressoni Araújo A; Miglino MA; Landgraf Guiguer E; Santos de Argollo Haber R; de Souza Bastos Mazuqueli Pereira E; Cavallari Strozze Catharin V; Cavallari Strozze Catharin V; Laurindo LF; Maria Barbalho S,International journal of molecular sciences,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41465572/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41459479,Beneficial effects of food-medicine homologous herbs for patients with diabetic kidney disease.,"Global diabetes rates are rising sharply, driving a parallel increase in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) - a key diabetic complication. This trend poses mounting public health and economic burdens worldwide. Current therapies remain inadequate, making DKD progression a pressing unmet need. This review aims to assess the efficacy and molecular mechanisms of food-medicine homologous herbs for DKD treatment. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase) from inception to March 2025, using keywords including ""diabetic kidney disease"", and ""traditional Chinese medicine"". The search was meticulously designed to cover relevant research extensively. Data extraction focused on herb names, bioactive compounds, experimental models, therapeutic effects, and molecular targets. This review highlights 29 food-medicine homologous herbs with proven safety and efficacy in DKD. These herbs alleviate immune-inflammatory responses by modulating NF-κB, interleukins, TNF-α, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. They also reduce mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial ROS production, improving oxidative stress via Keap1/Nrf2/ARE, AMPK/SIRT, and NF-κB pathways. Renal fibrosis is suppressed through targeting fibrosis markers and regulating TGF-β/Smad and Notch signaling. Additionally, these herbs inhibit the AGEs/RAGE axis, correct gut dysbiosis, reduce apoptosis, activate autophagy, inhibit ferroptosis, and modulate microRNAs, collectively exerting renoprotective effects in DKD. Food-medicine homologous herbs demonstrate properties that align well with medical nutrition therapy principles, offering novel adjunctive therapeutic options for DKD.",Zeng Q; Wang W; Li Y; Wang M; Liu Z; Yan L; Zhan J; Wang X; Liang Y; Yu R,Frontiers in immunology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41459479/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41459237,"The Dual Edge of zinc: linking excessive intake to obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular risks.","Zinc, an essential trace element, plays a pivotal role in numerous physiological processes, including antioxidant defense, immune regulation, and metabolic homeostasis. However, excessive Zn supplementation disrupts these pathways, contributing to the pathogenesis of chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. This systematic review explores the dual-edged nature of Zn by examining its molecular impacts, including antioxidant enzyme dysregulation, leptin receptor resistance, and inflammatory marker modulation. While optimal Zn levels confer protective benefits, such as improved insulin sensitivity and reduced oxidative stress, excessive intake triggers systemic inflammation, oxidative damage, and metabolic dysregulation. Contrasting evidence highlights dose-dependent effects and variability based on genetic and environmental factors, underscoring the need for tailored dietary guidelines. Knowledge gaps persist regarding Zn toxicity thresholds, long-term impacts, and interactions with other nutrients. Public health policies must prioritize balanced supplementation strategies to mitigate risks while leveraging Zn's therapeutic potential in chronic disease prevention. This review emphasizes the importance of precision nutrition and evidence-based approaches to optimize Zn's benefits while minimizing its adverse effects.",Das T; Ahongshangbam R; Chabungbam R; Singh KB,Acta biochimica Polonica,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41459237/,0,1,0,0,0,0
41437050,Effects of carotenoid supplementation on liver enzymes in adults: a GRADE-assessed systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Carotenoids are known for their beneficial effects in improving chronic diseases through their antioxidant properties. However, there has been no meta-analysis on the effects of carotenoids on liver enzymes and the evidence is inconsistent. So, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of carotenoid supplementation on liver enzyme levels in adults. Through November 2024, the PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science electronic databases were searched for eligible trials evaluating the carotenoid supplementation effects on the Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and weighted mean differences (WMDs) were calculated using the random effects model. As part of standard methods, dose-response, meta-regressions, sensitivity, and publication bias analyses were performed. Evidence certainty was assessed using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations for Assessment, Development, and Evaluation). Of the 15 studies (20 arms; n = 757), 7 included healthy participants, while 8 involved non-healthy individuals, including 4 studies on prediabetes or diabetes. Pooled estimates indicated non-significant effects of carotenoid supplementation on all enzymes including ALT (WMD: -2.25 IU/L, 95%CI: -4.84,0.34, P = 0.089), AST (WMD: -0.46 IU/L, 95%CI: -1.25,0.34, P = 0.259), ALP (WMD: -0.34 IU/L, 95%CI: -6.89,6.21, P = 0.918) and GGT (WMD: -0.43 IU/L, 95%CI: -3.06,2.21, P = 0.751) levels non-significantly. Significant reductions in ALT levels occurred in < 12 weeks (P = 0.028), BMI ≥ 25 (P = 0.045), and among non-healthy participants (P = 0.015). AST levels were significantly reduced in non-healthy participants (P = 0.003) with ages > 50 (P = 0.003) as well as GGT levels (P = 0.011) in non-healthy participants. Carotenoid supplementation might be beneficial in reducing liver enzymes, especially in non-healthy participants and in those with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.

41435994,Consensus statement on vitamin D role in metabolic health.,"The 8th International Conference Controversies in Vitamin D, held in September 2024, convened leading experts to address the multifaceted role of vitamin D in human health. Key discussions focused on its influence on metabolic health, including effects on sarcopenia, muscle function, and energy metabolism, as well as its role in obesity, cardiovascular health, and diabetes. Preclinical evidence was presented, suggesting a pivotal role of vitamin D in regulating muscle function and repair, potentially preventing sarcopenia. A relationship between low vitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations and increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes was supported by several preclinical and clinical studies. Vitamin D supplementation was recently demonstrated to help improve glycemia and reduce the progression to diabetes and increase the likelihood of regression to normal glucose regulation in adults with prediabetes. Despite mixed outcomes from large, population-based randomized clinical trials, the conference underscored the critical need for personalized research, through disease-specific clinical trials, to fully elucidate the therapeutic potential of vitamin D supplementation, particularly in chronic conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. In conclusion, while vitamin D demonstrates considerable promise in modifying a wide array of metabolic health concerns, rigorous scientific inquiry is essential to deepen our understanding of its mechanisms as well as potential protective effects and establish evidence-based guidelines for supplementation. This growing body of work has the potential to significantly enhance clinical outcomes and improve public health strategies, calling for continued exploration and collaboration in the field of vitamin D research.",Giustina A; di Filippo L; Aleksova A; Bollerslev J; Colao AM; Dawson-Hughes B; Donini LM; Ebeling PR; Lazaretti-Castro M; Lorusso R; Luzi L; Marcocci C; Minisola S; Napoli N; Pittas AG; Rizzoli R; Rovere Querini P; Santini F; Schafer AL; Virtanen JK; Bilezikian JP,Metabolism: clinical and experimental,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41435994/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41430994,The effect of probiotic supplementation during pregnancy on pregnancy complications: An umbrella meta-analysis.,"Previous studies have suggested that probiotics might help prevent pregnancy complications, although recent meta-analyses have shown inconsistent results. To address this, an umbrella meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the impact of probiotics on pregnancy complications. PubMed and Scopus databases were systematically searched for relevant meta-analyses, spanning from their inception to April 2024. The primary outcomes of interest were risk of gestational diabetes (GDM) and preeclampsia, and the secondary outcomes were gestational weight gain, gestational age (GA) at delivery, and cesarean section. A random-effects model was utilized to combine relative risks (RR) and standardized mean differences along with their respective 95% confidence intervals (CI) for categorical and continuous outcomes, respectively. In total, 27 studies involving 83,817 participants were incorporated. Probiotics supplementation notably decreased GDM risk (RR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.61-0.83) while raised the odds of preeclampsia (RR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.07-1.42) and increased GA (standardized mean differences = 0.07, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.11). Subgroup analyses supported the preventive effect on GDM across various study characteristics. High-quality studies confirmed the increased risk of preeclampsia with probiotic use. Increased GA was observed in studies of moderate quality, with lower doses and Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains. Probiotics did not significantly impact cesarean section or gestational weight gain in both overall and subgroup analyses. Probiotics supplementation among pregnant women resulted in a notable reduction in the risk of GDM but an elevation in the risk of preeclampsia and an extension of GA.",Gao Q; Sun Y; Qu Y; Li F; Li P,Medicine,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41430994/,0,1,0,1,0,0
41424065,Collagen supplementation in metabolic syndrome: a narrative review unraveling the biological mechanisms and effects.,"Collagen supplementation (CS) has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach with potential benefits for managing metabolic syndrome (MetS)-related risk factors. This narrative review integrates human evidence with preclinical mechanistic insights into the metabolic actions of collagen. Anti-obesity effects are attributed to increased satiety, gastric distension, GLP-1 secretion and enhanced fatty acid oxidation mediated by PPAR-α activation and AMPK signalling. In type 2 diabetes, collagen improves glucose homeostasis by enhancing insulin sensitivity, upregulating GLUT-4 and inhibiting dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), thereby prolonging incretin activity (GLP-1 and GIP) and supporting β-cell function. The antihypertensive effect of collagen peptides (CP) is primarily linked to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, which reduces angiotensin II levels while promoting bradykinin-mediated vasodilation and nitric oxide release. In addition, CP has shown potential in improving lipid profiles by modulating PPAR-γ and AMPK, increasing HDL-C and reducing LDL-C and triacylglycerols. Emerging evidence also supports a role for collagen in restoring gut microbiota balance, increasing short-chain fatty acid production and reducing pro-inflammatory and oxidative pathways, contributing to systemic metabolic regulation. Overall, these findings suggest CS exerts multi-targeted benefits on MetS components through modulation of endocrine, inflammatory and metabolic pathways. Nevertheless, larger, long-term clinical trials are warranted to determine optimal dosing regimens, evaluate long-term efficacy, and further elucidate microbiota-mediated effects.",Pueyo-Arias M; López-Yoldi M; Navas-Carretero S; González-Navarro CJ; Zulet MLÁ; Milagro FI,Nutrition research reviews,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41424065/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41373949,"Macronutrient, Micronutrient Supplementation and Monitoring for Patients on GLP-1 Agonists: Can We Learn from Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery?","<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are increasingly prescribed for people living with obesity and type 2 diabetes due to their efficacy in reducing appetite and body weight. However, by inducing caloric restriction and altering gastrointestinal physiology, GLP-1RAs may predispose patients to nutritional deficiencies. This review aimed to synthesise current evidence on energy, protein, vitamin, and mineral status in GLP-1RA users, and contextualises these findings with metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) guidelines. While metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) guidelines mandate structured nutritional monitoring, no equivalent frameworks exist for GLP-1RA therapy, highlighting a critical gap that justifies the need for this review. <b>Methods</b>: A narrative review was conducted in three stages: (i) searching PubMed and Embase OVID (August 2025) using MeSH terms and free-text keywords related to GLP-1RAs, micronutrients, and obesity; (ii) screening abstracts and full texts for eligibility; and (iii) synthesising results with comparison to bariatric surgery protocols. Eligible studies included clinical trials, observational cohorts, and reviews reporting nutritional outcomes in GLP-1RA users or describing MBS monitoring guidelines. <b>Results</b>: GLP-1RA therapy consistently reduced caloric intake, with frequent inadequacy of protein intake and occasional sarcopenia. Observational data reported that users developed nutritional deficiencies within 12 months, most commonly vitamin D, followed by thiamine and other B vitamins. Mineral deficiencies, particularly in iron, calcium, magnesium, and potassium, were also observed. <b>Conclusions</b>: GLP-1RAs are associated with clinically relevant risks of protein, vitamin, and mineral deficiencies. The absence of formal monitoring protocols represents an unmet clinical need, and adaptation of surveillance, as seen in MBS, which may help mitigate long-term complications.",Sibal R; Balamurugan G; Langley J; Graham Y; Mahawar K,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41373949/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41373705,The Role of the Gut Microbiota in Vascular Physiology and Health.,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of global morbidity and mortality. There are many well-known risk factors (dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, obesity) for these diseases, but there are also other factors with important implications in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases (VD). One of these is the gut microbiome, a metabolically active ""organ"" with many roles in physiological processes that are linked to VD. Moreover, in recent years, the microbiota has been studied as a ""target"" in the treatment of various diseases, from gastrointestinal diseases to cardiovascular or even neuropsychiatric diseases. Thus, nutraceuticals may have an important role in modulating the gut microbiota and preventing or treating VD. The aim of this review is to highlight the relationship between the intestinal microbiota and the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases, as well as the possible intervention by using nutraceuticals (vitamins, minerals, dietary supplements) to positively modulate the intestinal microbiota and thus to reduce the risk of VD.",Neag MA; Moacă LȘ; Deac AL; Măgureanu DC; Vulturar DM; Todea DA; Gherman D; Buzoianu AD; Gherman CD; Militaru FC,International journal of molecular sciences,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41373705/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41319491,Effects of vitamin D intake alone on elderly body composition: A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs.,"This study investigated the effect of vitamin D on body composition in individuals aged 60 years and older. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched from inception to April 22, 2024, for randomized controlled trials reporting skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), lean mass (LM), handgrip strength, and fat mass (FM) as primary or secondary outcomes in elderly individuals with a mean age of 60 years or older were included. The primary outcome was the change in SMI between vitamin D and control groups; secondary outcomes were changes in LM, FM, and handgrip strength. Seven randomized controlled trials met eligibility criteria. Mean age ranged from 60 to 74 years, participants ranged from 50 to 1094, and study durations ranged from 3 to 36 months. The mean baseline 25(OH)D concentration ranged from 15.1 to 33.0 ng/mL. The vitamin D intake group was not associated with an increase in SMI, LM, or handgrip strength compared to the control group, although a decrease in FM was observed. In the meta-analysis excluding studies that used active vitamin D, the vitamin D intake group was not associated with increases in SMI, LM, or handgrip strength, nor with a decrease in FM compared to the control group. In the present study, vitamin D intake did not increase SMI, LM, or handgrip strength in the elderly individuals, although a possible decrease in FM was observed. Further studies are needed to better elucidate the effects of vitamin D on body composition in the elderly.",Matsuyama T; Okada H; Saijo Y; Hasegawa Y; Nakajima H; Okamura T; Nakatani R; Ushigome E; Nakanishi N; Hamaguchi M; Fukui M,Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41319491/,0,1,0,1,0,0
41305676,"Magnesium: Health Effects, Deficiency Burden, and Future Public Health Directions.","Magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) is the fourth most abundant cation in the human body and a critical cofactor in hundreds of enzymatic reactions that regulate energy metabolism, neuromuscular function, cardiovascular health, bone integrity, immune defense, and psychological well-being. Despite its essential roles, magnesium deficiency remains common worldwide, driven by inadequate dietary intake, chronic diseases, medication use, and lifestyle factors. Low magnesium status is associated with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, migraines, depression, and chronic inflammation, whereas sufficient intake supports cardiometabolic resilience, skeletal strength, neurological stability, and healthy aging. This review synthesizes current evidence on magnesium metabolism, physiological functions, and the health consequences of deficiency, and it summarizes global status with attention to biomarker limitations, widespread suboptimal intake, and key demographic and lifestyle determinants. It also discusses dietary sources, supplementation, and innovative approaches such as food fortification, personalized nutrition, and improved diagnostic strategies.

41305580,Current Perspectives on Protein Supplementation in Athletes: General Guidance and Special Considerations for Diabetes-A Narrative Review.,"Proteins elicit various metabolic and physiological functions that are related to physical performance. Due to increased need in athletes, protein supplementation has been widely used to support recovery and performance. However, the extent to which acute gains in muscle protein synthesis translate into measurable performance remains debated. This narrative review synthesizes evidence from trials on supplemental proteins across resistance, endurance, and mixed-modality training, comparing sources (whey, casein, soy, pea, and blends). Moreover, this review summarizes dosing and timing strategies, with notes for master, diabetic, and female athletes. It is well-established that supplemental protein enhances fat-free mass and, to a lesser extent, strength when baseline dietary protein is suboptimal. However, the effects are smaller when habitual intake already meets athletic targets. Whey, as a rapid protein and rich in leucine, reliably elicits an acute anabolic response, while casein provides prolonged elevated aminoacidemia. When total intake and leucine thresholds are matched, plant proteins and blends can yield comparable long-term adaptations. In addition, studies showed that the distribution and strategic timing around exercise (post-exercise first, with optional pre-sleep casein or blends) support recovery during high-frequency training or energy deficit. Protein co-ingested with carbohydrate in endurance and high-intensity functional training (HIFT) can also help glycogen restoration and attenuate muscle-damage markers, though effects on sport outcomes are inconsistent. The evidence in diabetic athletes is limited; guidance extrapolates from diabetes and athlete studies, with benefits apparent when intake, quality, or distribution are limited. Furthermore, evidence indicates that anabolic resistance in master athletes requires higher per-meal doses and distribution, with post-exercise and pre-sleep feedings valuable. Consistently, female athletes partaking in aerobic and resistance training while supplementing with protein demonstrate desired body composition adaptations. Overall, although supplemental protein helps close gaps between intake and physiological demand, various factors may influence its regimen. Protein source may help the kinetics balance, amino-acid profile, and dietary preferences. Alternatively, timing may influence the protein effects on training and recovery.",Jahan-Mihan A; El Khoury D; Brewer GJ; Chapleau A,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41305580/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41305556,The Role of Diet in Women of Childbearing Age: Current Evidence Supporting Nutritional Recommendations.,"Nutrition during the reproductive years shapes women's immediate health, fertility, pregnancy outcomes, and long-term offspring well-being. This position paper narratively synthesizes and critically appraises evidence on how dietary patterns, macro-/micronutrients, and supplementation influence women's health, female fertility, and reproductive outcomes, to inform practical recommendations. We narratively reviewed recent reviews, cohort studies, clinical trials, and public-health guidance on macronutrients, key micronutrients, dietary patterns (with emphasis on the Mediterranean diet), ultra-processed food (UPF) intake, and targeted supplementation relevant to menstrual, metabolic, cardiovascular, skeletal, and reproductive outcomes. Balanced, diverse diets rich in whole and minimally processed foods support hormonal regulation, ovulatory function, healthy gestation, and chronic-disease risk reduction. Priority nutrients include iron, folate, calcium, vitamin D, zinc, vitamin B12, and long-chain omega-3s (DHA), with supplementation considered when dietary intake or bioavailability is inadequate. Evidence consistently links Mediterranean-style eating to improved metabolic health, insulin sensitivity, IVF success, lower gestational diabetes risk, and favorable neonatal outcomes. High UPF consumption is associated with poorer diet quality, inflammation, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and potential reproductive impairment, warranting a reduction in favor of nutrient-dense foods. Diet also influences cardiovascular and bone health through effects on lipids, glycemia, blood pressure, and mineral/vitamin status, with fiber-rich carbohydrates, unsaturated fats (notably olive oil), and adequate calcium-vitamin D emerging as central levers. For women of childbearing age, a Mediterranean-aligned, minimally processed dietary pattern-tailored to individual needs and complemented by prudent use of folate, iron, vitamin D, calcium, B12, and DHA when indicated-offers robust benefits across reproductive, metabolic, cardiovascular, and skeletal domains.

Nutraceutical interventions-bioactive compounds derived from foods or supplements that provide health benefits beyond basic nutrition-may support conventional therapy. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the effects of nutraceutical interventions on reproductive and metabolic outcomes in PCOS. This systematic review and meta-analysis was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024521879) and followed PRISMA 2020. Searches were performed in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and regional databases (January 2013-December 2024) and included 78 eligible studies. Eligible randomized and quasi-experimental studies assessed nutraceuticals such as vitamin D, inositol, and quercetin. Risk of bias was evaluated with standardized tools; certainty of evidence was graded by GRADE. Seventy-eight studies met inclusion criteria. Nutraceutical interventions significantly reduced fasting insulin (MD = -2.14 μIU/mL; 95% CI -3.12 to -1.16) and luteinizing hormone (MD = -1.34 mIU/mL; 95% CI -2.10 to -0.58) and increased sex-hormone-binding globulin (MD = +3.72 nmol/L; 95% CI 1.35 to 6.09). Vitamin D supplementation showed the strongest metabolic and hormonal improvements. Results for ovarian follicle count and menstrual bleeding were inconsistent. Nutraceutical interventions targeting metabolic and hormonal regulation may complement lifestyle therapy in women with PCOS.

41283242,Effectiveness of Selenium Supplementation in the Treatment of Graves-Basedow Disease: A Scoping Review.,"Graves-Basedow disease (GBD) is an autoimmune thyroid disorder characterized by loss of tolerance to the thyrotropin receptor, with clinical manifestations such as a hyperadrenergic state, goiter, orbitopathy, and myxedema, inter alia. Selenium is a micronutrient, essential for the synthesis of selenoproteins. Selenium deficiency has been linked to an increased risk and exacerbation of GBD and GBD orbitopathy; therefore, it has been suggested that supplementation with this micronutrient could modify some outcomes associated with both conditions. The objective of this scoping review was to synthesize and analyze the clinical trials that have evaluated the effectiveness of selenium on different outcomes in patients with GBD or GBD orbitopathy. The following databases were consulted: PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Biosis, ProQuest, Web of Science, and Google Scholar; and the search terms 'Graves-Basedow disease' or 'Graves' disease' or 'hyperthyroidism' or 'Graves' hyperthyroidism' or 'selenium or selenium supplementation' and 'effectiveness' were used. The search was limited to articles published in English between January 2000 and March 2025. To reduce selection bias, each article was reviewed independently by three authors using the Rayyan web tool and the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist. A total of 15 studies were identified (11 on patients with GBD and 4 on patients with GBD orbitopathy). In GBD, selenium supplementation was associated with significant improvements in TSH, FT4, FT3, TPOAb, TgAb, and TRAb levels; while in GBD orbitopathy, a positive effect of selenium supplementation was found on multiple clinical outcomes. Selenium supplementation in patients with GBD or GBD orbitopathy is associated with favorable biochemical and clinical outcomes.",Vargas-Uricoechea H; Castellanos-Pinedo A; Urrego-Noguera K; Pinzón-Fernández MV; Meza-Cabrera IA; Vargas-Sierra H,"Medical sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41283242/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41281301,"Diet, Physical Activity, and Sleep Assessment: A Portfolio Scoping Review of Measures in NIH-Funded Epidemiologic Studies.","Diet, physical activity, and sleep are behaviors occurring at regular intervals over the 24-hour period. To better understand how they interact and impact the etiology and prevention of chronic diseases, studies are needed that collect data on all 3 behaviors. This scoping review of the authors' portfolio aimed to identify cohort and interventional studies funded by the National Cancer Institute; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; and National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases that collected measures on all 3 behaviors, on 2 behaviors to better understand existing gaps, and on those with data across a 24-hour period (temporal data). Cohorts receiving National Cancer Institute funding; studies identified in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute National Sleep Research Resource and National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Central Repository; and active National Cancer Institute, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases intervention grants in Fiscal Years 2021-2022 were reviewed. Data were collected from 2021 to 2022 and analyzed from 2022 to 2023. Twenty-nine cohort and 47 interventional studies collected data on all 3 behaviors, of which 3 cohorts and 20 interventions collected temporal data. Forty-two cohort and 160 interventional studies collected data on 2 behaviors, of which 3 cohorts and 50 interventions collected temporal data; sleep data were most commonly missing. The most common temporal measures were 24-hour dietary recalls and actigraphy. Efforts to promote the collection of temporal data on all 3 behaviors simultaneously can support innovative research questions and analytic approaches focused on their interrelationships across the 24-hour period and health outcomes among various populations. Such efforts can inform tailored interventions and precision health research.",Shams-White MM; Faust EJ; Zimmer M; Krueger ES; Regan KS; Alfini AJ; Brown AGM; Brown MK; Evans ME; Herrick KA; Pratt CA; Shiroma EJ; Wolff-Hughes DL; Reedy J,AJPM focus,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41281301/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41270328,Artichoke and cardiometabolic health: A systematic and meta-analytic synthesis of current evidence.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of artichoke supplementation on cardiometabolic health markers in adults. A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted up to September 2024. Artichoke supplementation significantly reduced body mass index (WMD = -0.51 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95 % CI: 0.93 to -0.09) and waist circumference (WMD = -1.21 cm, 95 % CI: 2.24 to -0.17), while its effects on body weight and hip circumference were not statistically significant. Blood pressure outcomes revealed significant reductions in both systolic (WMD = -2.49 mmHg, 95 % CI: 4.33 to -0.65) and diastolic (WMD = -1.53 mmHg, 95 % CI: 3.01 to -0.05) pressures. Significant lipid profile improvements were observed in total cholesterol (WMD = -12.29 mg/dL, 95 % CI: 19.92 to -4.65), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (WMD = -10.31 mg/dL, 95 % CI: 18.57 to -2.04), and triglycerides (WMD = -12.85 mg/dL, 95 % CI: 24.77 to -0.93), with no significant effect on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Regarding glycemic indices, insulin (WMD = -1.83 mU/L, 95 % CI: 3.33 to -0.32) and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (WMD = -0.92, 95 % CI: 1.33 to -0.51) were significantly reduced, whereas fasting blood glucose and HbA1c were unaffected. Among liver function markers, alanine aminotransferase (WMD = -8.47 U/L, 95 % CI: 14.71 to -2.23) and alkaline phosphatase (WMD = -7.86 U/L, 95 % CI: 15.26 to -0.45) were significantly reduced, while aspartate aminotransferase showed a borderline non-significant effect. No significant change was observed in creatinine levels.

41238121,Body Selenium Status and Diabetes and Complications: The Multiphased Effect of Selenium.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a growing public health issue. Although selenium (Se) is essential for physiological functions and health, its clear link to T2D and related diseases is not yet fully understood. The 2021 meta-analysis of observational studies indicated a positive association between Se and T2D. Current observational studies regarding Se and T2D have proliferated rapidly, particularly with new data emerging from China; this evidence needs to be re-searched and summarized. Furthermore, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews regarding Mendelian randomization (MR) studies and the association between Se and diabetes-associated complications. Thus, in this comprehensive review, which integrated narrative synthesis and meta-analyses, we reviewed the experimental, observational, MR studies, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of Se in T2D and related complications. The intricate association between Se and T2D and related diseases is discussed, as well as the limitations of the existing studies and the reasons for inconsistent results. A narrative review of experimental data finds that supranutritional Se intake/abnormal selenoprotein expression promotes the T2D-like phenotype. Meanwhile, updated random-effects meta-analyses of both observational trials and MR trials support that high-Se status increases the T2D. However, meta-analyses of RCTs have not supported that Se supplementation is harmful to the incidence of T2D. Moreover, there is growing evidence that high-Se status improves prognosis and reduces the risk of complications in individuals with T2D, such as diabetic cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, retinopathy, and foot ulcers. Similarly complex relationships have been observed in diabetes-related liver disease; a positive association was observed between Se and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease based on meta-analysis, yet Se appears to protect against liver fibrosis. These complex, multiphased effects in the relationship between Se and T2D and associated complications have increased the challenges of making more appropriate dietary recommendations to achieve the optimal concentration range for humans.",Liang X; Li L; Lu H; Li Y; Zhang Q; Liu L,The Journal of nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41238121/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41228549,Nutritional Strategies to Address Malnutrition in Dialyses Patients: A Systematic Review.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Protein-energy wasting (PEW) is a common complication in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) receiving renal replacement therapy by dialyses. This condition is associated with higher morbidity, mortality, and poorer quality of life. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of different nutritional strategies-such as oral nutritional supplements and intra-dialytic parenteral nutrition-in improving the nutritional status of these patients. <b>Methods:</b> A systematic review was carried out in accordance with the PRISMA statement. Searches were performed in PubMed, BVS, and Scopus between January and March 2025. Randomised or controlled clinical trials published in English or Spanish, available in full text, involving adults on haemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialyses (PD) were included. Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria. <b>Results:</b> The nutritional interventions assessed produced consistent benefits in biochemical markers (e.g., serum albumin), muscle mass, inflammatory indices, and perceived quality of life. Intra-dialytic supplementation and multidisciplinary management were particularly effective in patients with moderate-to-severe malnutrition. <b>Conclusions:</b> Malnutrition is frequent and clinically significant in dialyses patients. Nutritional strategies-including oral supplementation, IDPN, and personalised counselling-effectively prevent and treat PEW. Early, tailored, evidence-based, and multidisciplinary implementation could decisively improve clinical prognosis and quality of life in this population.",Arroyo-Serrano P; Alonso-Dominguez R; Mas-Fontao S; Gonzalez-Parra E; Sánchez-Tocino ML,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41228549/,0,1,0,0,0,0
41228466,Tracing the Path from Obesity to Diabetes: How S-Allyl Cysteine Shapes Metabolic Health.,"<b>Background:</b> Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a multifactorial condition characterized by insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and abdominal obesity, which collectively increase the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. Lifestyle modification represents the first-line strategy in its management, whereas pharmacological interventions are complex and typically require long-term polypharmacotherapy. In this context, natural bioactive compounds with pleiotropic effects are gaining increasing attention. Among these, S-allyl cysteine (SAC), the major sulfur-containing compound derived from black garlic, has been identified as a promising candidate due to its well-documented antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. <b>Methods:</b> This narrative review examines the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying MetS and summarizes current evidence on the protective role of SAC against key pathological features of this condition, including oxidative stress, inflammation, glucose and lipid dysmetabolism, endothelial dysfunction, and gut microbiota alterations. <b>Results:</b> Preclinical studies indicate that SAC counteracts lipid accumulation, insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction, and gut dysbiosis through multiple mechanisms, including hydrogen sulfide release, reactive oxygen species scavenging, inhibition of advanced glycation end products, and modulation of metabolic pathways. <b>Conclusions:</b> SAC emerges as a promising nutraceutical for the prevention and management of MetS and its complications. This underscores the broader relevance of nutraceuticals as promising tools in mitigating metabolic dysfunctions and reducing the burden of cardiometabolic diseases.",Geddo F; Antoniotti S; Querio G; Gallo MP,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41228466/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41228407,Synergistic Effects of Exercise and Nano-Curcumin Supplementation in Women with Lifestyle-Related Diseases: A Scoping Review.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Lifestyle-related diseases such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and osteoarthritis disproportionately affect women due to hormonal, metabolic, and socio-cultural factors. Emerging evidence suggests that combining structured exercise with nano-curcumin, a bioavailable phytochemical formulation with potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, may provide synergistic benefits. This scoping review systematically synthesizes available evidence on the combined effects of nano-curcumin supplementation and exercise interventions on health outcomes in women with lifestyle-related diseases. <b>Methods:</b> Following the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology and the PRISMA-ScR framework, a comprehensive database search was conducted in March 2025 and updated in June 2025. Records were retrieved from Scopus (n = 30), Web of Science (n = 22), PubMed (n = 18), and other sources (n = 71), yielding a total of 141 studies. After screening and deduplication, eight studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. All the studies were conducted in Iran with small sample sizes (12-53 participants) and short intervention durations (6-16 weeks). Therefore, the current evidence is geographically and demographically limited. <b>Results:</b> Across the included trials, the combined interventions produced additive or synergistic improvements in oxidative stress markers, inflammatory cytokines, lipid and glucose metabolism, cardiovascular function, pulmonary capacity, muscle fitness, and psychological outcomes (e.g., depression). When paired with nano-curcumin supplementation at different concentrations, high-intensity interval training, aerobic exercise, Pilates, and resistance training consistently outperformed exercise or supplementation alone in modulating antioxidant defenses, reducing systemic inflammation, and improving metabolic risk factors. <b>Conclusions:</b> The integration of exercise and nano-curcumin supplementation appears to confer superior benefits for women with lifestyle-related diseases compared with either approach alone. These findings highlight the potential of combining phytochemicals with lifestyle interventions to optimize women's health outcomes. However, most available evidence originates from small, short-term studies in single geographic regions. Large-scale, multicenter, randomized controlled trials with diverse populations are warranted to establish standardized protocols and optimal dosing strategies, and to assess long-term safety and efficacy.",Cherappurath N; Navaf M; Ceylan Hİ; Elayaraja M; Sunooj KV; Satheesan ST; Thoompenthodi MA; Perumbalath S; Bayrakdaroğlu S; Muntean RI; Mavritsakis N; Kabeer DA,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41228407/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41218688,Why did we end up having so few vitamin D answers and what can we do about it? A provocative and narrative review.,"In spite of numerous vitamin D publications, including thousands of RCTs, meta-analyses, review papers and editorials, we still do not have answers to the most basic vitamin D questions. The recommendations for vitamin D intake are based on a few and questionable studies, and according to the latest Endocrine Society Guidelines from 2024, there is no clinical trial evidence for establishing serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) thresholds to define vitamin D deficiency. Furthermore, large and impressive vitamin D RCTs, some with more than 20,000 participants, have failed to show significant effects on disease prevention. However, there are indications that vitamin D may have a small preventive effect on type 2 diabetes and auto-immune diseases, and vitamin D may also improve cancer survival. In general, the RCTs have been under-powered, and most subjects included were already vitamin D sufficient. The time for new vitamin D mega trials is probably over, and in the future, we have to design our RCTs smarter. One should mainly include subjects with low serum 25OHD levels, use individual dosing to reach a preset 25OHD level [treat-to-target), use realistic power calculations, and we should use similar study designs to facilitate individual patient data meta-analyses. We must be willing to realize that we have failed, we must be willing to change, and we must be willing to pull our forces together. A vitamin D consensus conference is highly needed. We cannot accept that in 2025 we do not know what is a sufficient serum 25OHD level.",Jorde R,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41218688/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41217691,"Taurine in Type 2 Diabetes: Plasma Concentrations, Metabolic Pathways, and Potential as a Therapeutic Adjuvant.","This narrative review aims to synthesize evidence regarding plasma taurine concentrations in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), explore the underlying mechanisms involved and evaluate the therapeutic potential of taurine as an adjuvant treatment. Finally, it highlights key knowledge gaps and perspectives for future clinical research. Taurine, a sulfur-containing amino acid, exhibits notable antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It plays essential roles in glucose homeostasis, osmoregulation, mitochondrial protection, and the neutralization of reactive and toxic compounds. T2DM, the most common form of diabetes, is characterized by insulin resistance, pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, low-grade systemic inflammation, and oxidative stress-factors that aggravate glucose dysregulation and cellular damage. Although lifestyle interventions are the cornerstone of T2DM management, there is growing interest in complementary therapies that target these molecular dysfunctions. Plasma taurine concentrations have been found to be reduced in individuals with T2DM, likely due to impaired reabsorption, increased renal excretion, and elevated tissue demand caused by hyperglycemia and chronic inflammation. Experimental studies suggest that taurine supplementation can enhance insulin secretion, improve insulin signaling via the PI3K/Akt pathway, and modulate GLP-1 release. Preliminary human trials also indicate improvements in insulin sensitivity and fasting glucose levels. Taurine is essential for metabolic and cellular homeostasis, with reduced levels observed in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Emerging evidence suggests its supplementation may help counteract diabetes-related metabolic dysfunctions, supporting its potential as a complementary therapeutic strategy.",Fogagnolo C; Ortiz GU; Travieso SG; Rossini-Venturini AC; Abud GF; Silva BM; da Silva ASR; de Freitas EC,Current nutrition reports,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41217691/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41216817,"The Role of Iron as a Micronutrient in Key Biological Functions, Health and Diseases in Human.","Iron is a key micronutrient essential for the function of many enzymatic and non-enzymatic proteins that carry out a diverse set of biological functions, including erythropoiesis, oxygen transport, cellular respiration and immunity. Iron levels are tightly maintained in the human body, while reduced or excess amounts of iron can lead to many different health concerns. Despite the numerous approaches, including iron supplementation, currently being employed at both the individual and community levels to address iron deficiency, it is still a global health concern that primarily affects lower-income communities and people suffering from different diseases and health conditions, such as cancer, infectious diseases, abnormal menstruation and pregnancy. Iron overload is also an adverse health condition that leads to detrimental effects on human health. Excessive iron accumulation in the body due to hereditary hemochromatosis or long-term high iron intake in individuals with hemochromatosis can lead to life-threatening conditions, such as impaired cellular respiration, diabetes and impairment and failure of key organs. Chelation therapy and blood removal are well-known therapeutic strategies that have been used in controlling iron overload. This review considers the role of iron in human physiology, its involvement in various pathological conditions, and the consequences of iron deficiency and iron overload.

41182953,Healthy aging in midlife and menopausal transition in Asia: nutrient synergy with dietary supplements.,"Women in early midlife often experience specific health issues due to aging and the menopausal transition. Hormonal changes, systemic chronic inflammation and micronutrient deficiencies contribute to symptoms such as vasomotor disturbances, metabolic syndrome, neurocognitive decline and reduced mobility, which can adversely affect overall health and quality of life. However, the menopausal transition also offers opportunities for improving health and preventing diseases. Many women use dietary supplements as a form of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to manage these complex challenges during this life stage. Given the multifaceted nature of these health concerns, an integrated approach that combines dietary supplements with conventional medicine and harnesses nutrient synergy for enhanced benefits should be considered. This article examines current evidence on the use of multivitamins, minerals and dietary supplements (including those containing phytonutrients and other CAMs) for health issues during early midlife and the menopausal transition. Although current evidence suggests that multi-nutrient dietary supplementation combinations are promising, further research is needed to verify their effectiveness and evaluate potential interactions with standard treatments across diverse populations. The successful integration of dietary supplements alongside conventional medicine during the menopausal transition will also require personalized care, support from healthcare professionals and public education.",Jaisamrarn U; Habana MA; Damodaran P; Tint MT; Chuang HH; Hunter DJ; Makkar BM; Padma V; Oh SW; Krishna A; Dahia V; Macalintal MD,Climacteric : the journal of the International Menopause Society,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41182953/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41177307,Effects of carnitine supplementation on glycemic markers in women with overweight and obesity: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Women with overweight or obesity face heightened risks of insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. L-carnitine, a key mediator of mitochondrial fatty acid transport, has been proposed to improve glycemic regulation, yet evidence in this subgroup remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of carnitine supplementation versus placebo on glycemic markers in overweight or obese women. Major databases were searched through October 2025. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models. Predefined subgroup analyses explored dose and intervention duration effects. A total of eight studies comprising nine randomized controlled trial (RCT) arms were included. Carnitine supplementation significantly reduced fasting blood sugar (FBS; WMD -2.93 mg/dL, 95 % CI -5.20 to -0.65), fasting insulin (WMD -3.54 μU/mL, 95 % CI -7.00 to -0.07), and HOMA-IR (WMD -0.69, 95 % CI -1.26 to -0.13), but had no significant effect on QUICKI. Subgroup analyses indicated stronger effects at higher doses (≥2000 mg/day) and longer durations (≥12 weeks). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of findings, with no evidence of publication bias. Carnitine supplementation yields modest but clinically meaningful improvements in fasting glucose, insulin levels, and insulin resistance among overweight and obese women, particularly with higher dosages and longer interventions.

41156555,Chlorogenic Acid's Role in Metabolic Health: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Potential.,"Chlorogenic acid (CGA), an ester of caffeic and quinic acids, is a dietary polyphenol abundant in coffee, tea, fruits, vegetables, and medicinal plants, with 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid (5-CQA) as its predominant isomer. This review aims to summarize current knowledge on the biological activities, mechanisms of action, and potential therapeutic applications of CGA in the prevention and management of metabolic disorders. CGA demonstrates a broad spectrum of biological activities relevant to human health. Its mechanisms of action involve modulation of oxidative stress and key cellular signaling pathways, as well as regulation of metabolic processes, contributing to improved insulin sensitivity, lipid balance, and overall energy homeostasis. These properties make CGA a promising agent against metabolic syndrome (type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia) which is a major global health challenge. Despite its health benefits, CGA's oral bioavailability remains limited, prompting research into optimized extraction methods, novel formulations, and structural modifications. Current evidence supports its safety even at high doses, reinforcing its potential as a nutraceutical, functional food ingredient, and adjunctive therapeutic compound in chronic disease management.",Zalewska K; Kulawik M; Gierszewska J; Gramala Z; Kalus O; Karpiński M; Maćkowiak J; Staniewski A; Szymańska Z; Zalewska B; Lu W; Cielecka-Piontek J; Zalewski P,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41156555/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41156531,Marine-Based Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Metabolic Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a set of cardiometabolic abnormalities, including central obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and hyperglycemia, that substantially increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Marine-derived omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (<i>n</i>-3 PUFAs), especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), may improve MetS components through triglyceride-lowering, anti-inflammatory, and insulin-sensitizing effects; however, randomized controlled trial (RCT) results remain inconsistent, and the influence of dose and intervention duration is unclear. Following PRISMA guidelines, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched to June 2024 for RCTs in adults with MetS or its components. Eligible trials assessed marine-derived omega-3 supplementation (EPA/DHA) versus placebo or control and reported at least one MetS diagnostic criterion (triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, fasting plasma glucose, blood pressure, or waist circumference) or related parameter (LDL cholesterol, HOMA-IR, or HbA1c). Data were extracted in duplicate and quality assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool. Trials were categorized by dose-low (<1000 mg/day), medium (1000-2000 mg/day), and high (>2000 mg/day)-and duration: short-term (ST; ≤8 weeks), medium-term (MT; >8-12 weeks), and long-term (LT; >12 weeks). Meta-regression using ordinary least squares estimated dose-duration effects. Publication bias was assessed with funnel plots and Egger's test for outcomes with ≥3 studies. Twenty-one RCTs (<i>n</i> ≈ 1950) were included. For triglycerides, the largest reductions occurred in the high-dose LT (-56.78 mg/dL ± 3.44) and ST (-50.873 mg/dL ± 3.04) groups, and MT duration (-41.536 mg/dL ± 4.12), showing that in high doses of omega-3, the beneficial effect of reducing TGs was more prominent in long-term and short-term treatment other than with medium-term duration of treatment. In comparison, the result for medium-dose with MT duration was (-24.93 mg/dL ± 0.464) and for LT duration was (-31.843 mg/dL ± 0.46), all <i>p</i> < 0.001. In LDL cholesterol, an increase in the low-dose ST group (+7.04 mg/dL ± 4, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and low-dose LT group (+35.525 mg/dL ± 4.33, <i>p</i> < 0.001) was observed. In other subgroups, either there were no data available or the number of studies was limited and could not be considered as statistically significant in meta-analysis due to low power. As for HDL cholesterol, FBS, SBP, DBP, waist circumference, BMI, and HOMA-IR, the data extracted from the included studies were not sufficient to be eligible for the meta-analysis. Marine-derived omega-3 supplementation produces substantial triglyceride reductions, especially at doses >2000 mg/day for ≥8 weeks. HDL cholesterol and blood pressure benefits are not consistent, fasting glycemia is largely unaffected, and LDL cholesterol may increase, especially in low doses. High-dose marine omega-3s can be considered as part of dietary strategies for MetS management, with monitoring for LDL changes.

41155275,Role of Mast Cells and Their Mediators in Chronic Kidney Diseases.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects as many as 10% of the population, which translates to about 850 million globally. Even though genetics, diabetes, and hypertension contribute to CKD, the underlying pathologic processes remain poorly understood. Mast cells (MCs) are unique tissue immune cells capable of secreting numerous biologically active molecules. MCs have been associated with kidney diseases and poor CKD outcomes, but they have received limited attention in CKD research. MCs are typically located perivascularly and are identified through kidney biopsies, which limits their diagnostic utility. MC-specific biomarkers such as histamine and the proteases chymase and tryptase show potential, but signature biomarker profiles are needed. While MC biomarkers have been studied in non-renal diseases, their clinical relevance in kidney disease remains underexplored. This review aims to clarify the role of MCs in kidney diseases, such as diabetic nephropathy, IgA nephropathy, hypertensive nephropathy, pruritus, parathyroidism, renal amyloidosis, and lupus nephritis, as well as in conditions such as kidney fibrosis, inflammation, and kidney transplant rejection. Evidence indicates an increased number of MCs, as judged by increased urine levels of histamine, chymase, IL-33, metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and tryptase. In conclusion, MCs are involved in the pathogenesis of CKD and may represent new targets for early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.",Tziastoudi M; Cholevas C; Eleftheriadis T; Stefanidis I; Theoharides TC,International journal of molecular sciences,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41155275/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41154485,Dietary Supplements Derived from Food By-Products for the Management of Diabetes Mellitus.,"The rising global incidence of diabetes has heightened the demand for prevention strategies that are both effective and environmentally sustainable. In this context, dietary supplements obtained from food processing by-products have emerged as promising candidates, combining high nutritional value with the potential to reduce food waste. These by-products contain abundant bioactive compounds, such as antioxidants, dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals, that have been associated with improved glycemic regulation. Their beneficial effects are mediated through several interconnected biological mechanisms, including enhanced insulin sensitivity, attenuation of oxidative stress, and modulation of inflammatory pathways. The efficacy of these supplements is supported by findings from preclinical models, clinical trials, and meta-analyses, which also allow comparison with standard antidiabetic interventions. Alongside these findings, considerations related to safety, toxicity, and the regulatory framework are critical for their integration into preventive health strategies. Furthermore, market trends, technological challenges in supplement formulation, and ethical issues surrounding the valorization of food waste are key factors influencing their development and acceptance. Together, these insights underscore the dual therapeutic and ecological potential of food by-product-derived supplements in diabetes prevention, while identifying essential avenues for future research and innovation.",Yuksek EN; Pereira AG; Prieto MA,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41154485/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41139799,Vitamin D for Painful Diabetic Neuropathy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomised Controlled Trials.,"Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) is a common complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, causing substantial morbidity. Current treatments, including antidepressants and analgesics, are often only partially effective and may have significant side effects. Vitamin D deficiency affects around 60% of people with diabetes, making supplementation a low-toxicity, biologically plausible intervention. Observational studies suggest potential benefit, but robust evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is lacking. To systematically review and synthesise RCT evidence on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on pain outcomes in PDN. A systematic search was conducted in Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, EBSCO and Google Scholar up to September 2025. Eligible studies were RCTs comparing vitamin D supplementation with placebo in adults with diabetes and PDN. The primary outcome was pain intensity measured with validated tools. A fixed-effects meta-analysis was performed, with results expressed as standardised mean differences (SMD). Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane RoB tool, and publication bias examined via Egger's funnel plot. Five studies met inclusion criteria; four (n = 320) were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled results showed a significant short-term reduction in pain with vitamin D versus placebo (SMD = -0.85; 95% CI: -1.07 to -0.62), with moderate heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 61.4%), equivalent to ~11 points on common pain scales. No studies reported medium- or long-term outcomes. Study quality varied, with concerns regarding allocation concealment and selective outcome reporting. Four trials were prospectively registered. Vitamin D supplementation may reduce short-term pain in PDN, but evidence is limited by small sample sizes and methodological quality. Larger, rigorously designed RCTs with longer follow-up are needed before routine vitamin D testing or supplementation can be recommended for PDN in clinical practice.",Gilbody A; Gilbody J,"Endocrinology, diabetes & metabolism",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41139799/,0,1,0,1,0,1
41129483,Effects of Maternal Vitamin D Supplementation on Childhood Health.,"Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of health issues in the offspring. Accordingly, recent Endocrine Society guidelines strongly support supplementation in pregnancy, also underlining that without consensus on optimal maternal vitamin D levels, routine screening is currently irrelevant. Knowledge of organ-specific effects of vitamin D and its association with maternal vitamin D status may aid in optimizing vitamin D supplementation. This systematic review outlines the proposed next-generation effects of vitamin D supplementation ≥400 IU/d and explores whether such effects are attributed to a specific maternal vitamin D level obtained during pregnancy. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed and Embase according to the PRISMA guidelines, focusing on health outcomes from 10 days postpartum and beyond. Of the 2383 screened articles, 38 were included. In 11 of 16 studies, vitamin D supplementation reduced respiratory tract infections in the first years of life. Growth or bone development benefits were observed in 6 of 12 studies. Positive effects on neurodevelopment and reduced autoimmune risk (diabetes-related antibodies) were noted, although further research is needed to determine the role of vitamin D. Very few studies have measured vitamin D concentrations, but even 1600 IU/d supplementation was associated with high frequency of infant vitamin D insufficiency. Current recommendations may not ensure sufficient vitamin D levels at birth, among others, increasing the risk of early-life infections. Further studies linking maternal and infant vitamin D levels to specific outcomes would aid in personalized nutritional advice during pregnancy and improve next-generation health.",Svensson NS; Volqvartz T; Vestergaard AL; Vestergaard ET; Larsen A; Bor P,Endocrine reviews,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41129483/,0,1,0,0,0,0
41128848,[Diabetic retinopathy and risk modification through diet and dietary supplements].,"A diabetes-appropriate diet and exercise are essential components in the management of diabetes. Systematic reviews on the influence of diet on diabetic retinopathy (DR) suggest that nutrition plays an important role in risk reduction. Early dietary modification can slow or even prevent the development and progression of DR. A Mediterranean diet, high fruit, vegetable and fish consumption as well as reduced caloric intake may have a protective effect on the development of DR; however, most of the nutrition-related reviews on DR have focused on a specific food, nutrient or dietary pattern; nevertheless, few have comprehensively evaluated the entire spectrum of dietary components. Although there are clear recommendations on diet and guidelines for the treatment of diabetes and prediabetes, their specific contribution to the development and progression of DR is not clearly defined. . Evidence suggests that early dietary modification or dietary modification in the early stages can slow or even prevent the development and progression of DR, thus reducing the treatment burden. Another important lifestyle factor is physical activity, which can also modulate the risk of DR. In this review, we present the current scientific literature on this topic, including the most important natural molecules that can support conventional treatment of DR.",Chronopoulos A; Garzone D; Finger RP,Die Ophthalmologie,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41128848/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41098674,The role of the myo-inositol for the prevention of the gestational diabetes <i>mellitus</i>: systematic review.,"This review evaluated myo-inositol supplementation's effectiveness in pregnant women at high risk for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM). A systematic search in PubMed/MedLine, Cochrane, and VHL databases was conducted using the following terms: ""inositol,"" ""diabetes,"" ""gestational diabetes,"" and ""prevention,"" with no limits on publication period or language. The reference lists were scanned for additional articles. Relevant studies were identified by screening titles, abstracts, and full texts, following inclusion and exclusion criteria and eliminating duplicates. One additional study was added after reviewing references. Guided by the PRISMA Statement, data were extracted using Microsoft Excel. The primary outcome was GDM incidence; secondary outcomes included maternal, birth, neonatal health, and adverse effects. Five studies were included. Myo-inositol supplementation significantly decreased the incidence of GDM in all studies. One study noted significant weight loss. Three studies found no reduction in insulin treatment needs with myo-inositol supplementation. One study showed a decrease in macrosomia incidence. No decrease in cesarean delivery rates was verified, though one study noted reduced hypertensive disorders' incidence with myo-inositol. Four studies evidenced no reduction in premature birth or shoulder dystocia. There was no significant difference in hypoglycemia incidence in three studies. One study showed a decrease in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit admissions with myo-inositol supplementation. One patient reported headaches. Due to study divergences, no clinical recommendations can be made. However, myo-inositol supplementation appears effective in reducing GDM incidence in at-risk pregnant women.",de Holanda TT; Vasconcelos JA; Oliveira NMV; Moreira JLC; Bruno SKB; de Sousa MDRP; Vasconcelos CTM,Revista brasileira de ginecologia e obstetricia : revista da Federacao Brasileira das Sociedades de Ginecologia e Obstetricia,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41098674/,0,1,0,0,0,0
41096642,The Role of Vitamin C in Selected Autoimmune and Immune-Mediated Diseases: Exploring Potential Therapeutic Benefits.,"Autoimmune diseases are characterized by immune response dysregulation against self-components, leading to chronic inflammation and tissue damage. Vitamin C (VitC), a water-soluble vitamin with established functions in antioxidant defence and collagen synthesis, has also been of interest based on its potential immunomodulatory effects. This review discusses the role of VitC in the course and progression of (A) autoimmune diseases (multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's disease, type 1 diabetes, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, pernicious anaemia, antiphospholipid syndrome), (B) other immune-mediated diseases (Crohn's disease, periodontitis), and (C) Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder with autoimmune features. Results from clinical, observational, and experimental trials show that VitC deficiency is common in many of these diseases and may contribute to increased oxidative stress and immune disequilibrium. Supplementation has been associated with improved antioxidant levels, control of inflammatory mediators, and, in some cases, clinical outcomes like disease activity decrease or symptom load. Although findings vary across conditions and few large, randomized trials are available, the overall evidence indicates that maintaining good VitC status can be useful in maintaining immune homeostasis and reducing inflammation. VitC should be viewed as an adjunct to be employed safely, perhaps and ideally within larger treatment regimens, but not in place of effective therapies. Further research, including large-scale clinical trials, will be required to determine more clearly optimal dosing, timing of treatment, and patient population most likely to benefit. By integration of current knowledge, this review recognizes both promise in VitC for treatment of autoimmune/immune-mediated disease and promise in its potential use within future treatment regimens.",Mochol M; Jablonowski L; Pawlik A; Rasławska-Socha J; Chamarczuk A; Lipski M; Mazurek-Mochol M,International journal of molecular sciences,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41096642/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41073938,Selenium supplementation for management of gestational diabetes mellitus in pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Selenium is thought to improve glucose and lipid metabolism in pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus. However, this finding is somewhat controversial. In this paper, we evaluated the effects of selenium supplementation on glucose and lipid metabolism in patients with GDM. Searches were carried out in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, EMBASE, CBM, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wan Fang, and VIP from their inception until May 2025. Two reviewers independently extracted data. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was applied to assess the methodological quality of every study and Meta-analysis was carried out with a random effects model or a fixed effects model. Publication bias was evaluated by the Begg and Egger tests. Four randomized controlled trials, with 230 participants in total, were included. Participants were between 18 and 45 years old. The time span of these studies ranged from 2015 to 2022. The daily dose of selenium supplementation was from 100 µg/d to 200 µg/d and the duration of intervention was 6 weeks to 12 weeks. Compared with placebo group, the selenium group did not significantly reduce the level of homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance(P = 0.20, MD = -0.71, 95%CI: -1.80, 0.37). Selenium supplementation at 200 µg/d significantly reduced fasting plasma glucose(P = 0.0002, MD = -5.03, 95% CI: -7.70, -2.37) and the incidence of newborn's hyperbilirubinemia((P = 0.0003, MD = 0.09, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.33). However, there was no obvious differences in improving total cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein cholesterol and high density lipoprotein cholesterol. For pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus, daily supplementation with 200 µg of selenium may help lower fasting blood glucose levels and the risk of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn, but it does not significantly affect total cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, or high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Given the limitations of this study, these conclusions require further validation.",Sun J; Liu L; Shen J; Du J,BMC endocrine disorders,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41073938/,0,1,0,1,0,0
41067797,Therapeutic effects of chromium supplementation on women with polycystic ovarian syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) has been treated recently with chromium supplementations. However, it is unknown if this dietary supplement has similar effect to metformin. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of chromium supplementation in women with PCOS. A meta-analysis was conducted using relevant articles obtained from searches of PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar. The mean difference and standardized mean difference were employed to determine the effect size for biochemical parameters. A total of 10 randomized controlled trials involving 683 women were included in the analysis. The results indicated that chromium supplementation, as vs a placebo, significantly decreased fasting blood insulin (P=0.01), triglyceride (P<0.00001), total cholesterol (P<0.00001), very low-density lipoprotein (P<0.00001), low-density lipoprotein (P=0.0003), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (P=0.02), malondialdehyde (P=0.007), follicle stimulating hormone (P=0.0007), and prolactin (P=0.01), and increased the Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (P=0.02), total antioxidant capacity (P<0.0001), and ovulation incidence (P=0.001). Chromium supplementation was also found to be more effective than metformin in reducing HOMA-IR (P<0.00001), and luteinizing hormone (P=0.04). Chromium picolinate supplementation at a dosage of 200μg may provide benefits similar to metformin with regard to FBG, FBI, ovulation, and pregnancy incidence, with fewer side effects in patients with PCOS. Further experiments are still required to draw effective dietary guidelines related to chromium.",Hamsho M; Ranneh Y; Fadel A,"Endocrinologia, diabetes y nutricion",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41067797/,0,1,0,1,0,0
41038680,Modulation of gene expression by traditional Asian antidiabetic nutraceuticals: A review of potential effects.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has emerged as a significant global public health concern. Multiple studies have shown that traditional nutraceuticals are potential to treat T2DM and its complications. This review will explore traditional nutraceuticals with antidiabetic properties with a focus on traditional Asian nutraceuticals and their antioxidant effects on gene expression associated to T2DM. Literature searching was conducted in Pubmed, Scopus, and Science Direct using the keywords ""nutraceutical"", ""antidiabetic"", ""insulin resistance"", ""Diabetes Mellitus"", ""herbal medicine"", ""mechanism"", ""pathway"", ""traditional food"", ""functional food"", ""antioxidant"", ""clinical"", ""preclinical"", ""animal studies"", and ""Asian"" combined with Boolean operators ""OR"". Nutraceuticals sourced from traditional Indonesian herbal beverages, including Galohgor, Bir Pletok, and Wedang Uwuh, have shown potential efficacy in reducing hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and obesity in T2DM. Furthermore, multiple Asian plants and their bioactive compounds, such as curcumin, kaempferol, cinnamon, saponin, quercetin, myricetin, anthocyanin, terpenoid, alkaloid, and gallic acid, have been shown to beneficially influence glucose ho-meostasis, insulin sensitivity, and problems associated with diabetes. Moreover, bioactive compounds of these traditional nutraceuticals have been proven in modulating gene expression associated with β-cell function, insulin signaling pathway, and antioxidant activity, which may offer a new therapeutic target. This review highlights the increasing scientific evidence on the role of traditional nutraceuticals for the prevention and management of diabetes mellitus, presenting promising alternatives to standard pharmacologi-cal therapy.

41032188,An Insight into Chickpea-Derived Secondary Metabolites as Functional and Nutraceutical Agents against Diabetes.,"Legumes are a main source of sustainable, inexpensive protein, dietary fiber, phytochemicals, micronutrients, and bioactive components. Among them, chickpeas hold a significant place in terms of production and consumption. The review focuses on the functional activity of chickpeas as a rich source of polyphenols and flavonoids, exploring their potential effects against diabetes. The consumption of chickpeas in various forms, such as bakery items, chapatti, weaning foods, plant-based beverages, flour, and extruded snacks, is considered healthy. Chickpea-based diets generally have a low glycemic index, which is beneficial for preventing metabolic syndrome and managing diabetes. This review specifically highlights the phytochemical composition of chickpeas, emphasizing their bio-pharmacological properties against a highly prevalent disease, i.e., diabetes. Furthermore, Cicer arietinum Linn. plays a significant role in controlling blood sugar by enhancing beta cell function, which regulates insulin production through the GLUT<sub>4</sub> pathway. The hypoglycemic mechanisms of chickpeas have been elucidated concerning classic diabetes treatment targets, such as insulin receptor signaling pathways and other related pathways involved in the progression of diabetes, including key enzymes alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase.

41022286,Probiotics and Synbiotics Supplementation Reduce Inflammatory Cytokines in Individuals with Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Findings from a Systematic Review Meta-analysis.,"Chronic inflammation plays a significant role in the development and progression of diabetes. Despite growing interest in probiotic and synbiotic supplementation, there is limited consensus on their efficacy in modulating inflammatory cytokines. This meta-analysis evaluates the impact of these supplements on inflammatory cytokines in adults with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A comprehensive search was conducted on online databases from their inception to September 2025 to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Data were extracted from selected studies, and the overall effect size was determined using weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) through a random-effects model. The pooled analysis of 22 RCTs, including 1321 individuals with prediabetes and T2DM, showed that probiotic and synbiotic supplementation significantly reduced C-reactive protein (CRP) (WMD: -0.46 mg/L, 95% CI: [-0.77, -0.15], p=0.003), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (WMD: -0.43 pg/ml, 95% CI: [-0.76, -0.09], p=0.012), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) (WMD: -1.42 pg/ml, 95% CI: [-2.15, -0.69], p<0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed that CRP reduction was greatest among participants with baseline CRP ≥3 mg/L, those undergoing longer interventions (≥12 weeks), individuals with T2DM, overweight participants, and when probiotics were administered. IL-6 levels were significantly reduced in obese individuals, particularly with longer treatment durations and synbiotic interventions, while TNF-α reductions were most pronounced in long-term interventions (≥12 weeks), especially among T2DM patients with normal BMI and when probiotics were used. In conclusion, probiotic and synbiotic supplementation significantly reduces inflammatory cytokines (CRP, IL-6, TNF-α) in individuals with prediabetes and T2DM, with the strongest effects observed in those with higher baseline inflammation and longer intervention durations, underscoring the importance of tailoring supplementation strategies to individual inflammation status, intervention duration, and metabolic profile to optimize therapeutic outcomes.",Setayesh A; Karimi M; Valizadeh F; Asbaghi O; Pirzad S; Davoodi SH; Larijani B,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41022286/,0,1,0,1,0,0

The balance of the gut microbiota can be easily disturbed by external factors such as lifestyle, diet and drugs. Some medications-such as metformin used to treat type 2 diabetes, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, statins for cardiovascular diseases, proton pump inhibitors for reducing stomach acid secretion, and pharmaceuticals for lowering blood pressure-can affect the balance of the gut microbiota, causing dysbiosis, which in turn may lead to other diseases. Dietary supplements, probiotics, prebiotics and certain medications alter the composition of the gut microbiota, which plays an essential role in alleviating metabolic disorders. This study discusses the effects of the long-term use of selected pharmaceuticals on the gut and probiotic microbiota in patients.

This meta-analysis aimed to assess the effects of vitamin D supplementation on glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c%), HOMA-IR, HOMA-β, LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting insulin, fasting plasma glucose, C-reactive protein, and the likelihood of reversion to normoglycemia in prediabetic individuals. <b>Methods:</b> A comprehensive search of multiple databases was performed using keywords including ""diabetes mellitus,"" ""type 2 diabetes,"" ""vitamin D supplementation,"" and ""VD supplementation."" Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria. <b>Results:</b> Vitamin D supplementation was associated with significant improvements across several parameters, including HOMA-β (SMD = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.63-0.80; <i>p</i> < 0.00001), HDL cholesterol (SMD = 0.07; 95% CI: 0.05-0.09; <i>p</i> < 0.00001), and others (SMD = -0.40; 95% CI: -0.45 to -0.34; <i>p</i> < 0.00001). <b>Conclusions:</b> Vitamin D supplementation appears to provide beneficial effects on glycemic, lipid, and inflammatory markers in patients with diabetes and prediabetes. Specifically, supplementation significantly reduced HbA1c%, HOMA-IR, LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting insulin, fasting glucose, and C-reactive protein while increasing the rate of normoglycemia among prediabetic individuals.

41010464,Hydroxytyrosol Bioavailability: Unraveling Influencing Factors and Optimization Strategies for Dietary Supplements.,"Hydroxytyrosol (HT) is a major phenolic compound in olives and extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), known for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cardiometabolic properties. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has approved a health claim for the protection of LDL particles from oxidative damage only when HT is consumed within EVOO, which limits its direct use in supplements or functional foods. Since its biological effects depend on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME), understanding how formulation and delivery strategies influence bioavailability is essential. HT is mainly present as secoiridoid derivatives in EVOO, whereas in supplements, it often appears in its free form, potentially affecting its metabolic fate. This review summarizes human studies on HT bioavailability from EVOO, isolated supplements, and enriched foods, and examines how matrix type, chemical modifications of HT, and advanced delivery systems, such as emulsions, encapsulation, and vesicular carriers, modulate absorption and metabolism. The gut microbiota is highlighted as an emerging factor in HT biotransformation, although its role remains underexplored. Further well-designed human studies are needed to guide the development of nutraceutical formulations capable of replicating the health benefits of EVOO beyond its natural matrix.",Jordán M; García-Acosta N; Espartero JL; Goya L; Mateos R,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41010464/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40999397,Effect of carnosine or beta-alanine supplementation therapy for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Carnosine and beta-alanine (β-alanine) have shown potential in the management of chronic conditions, including metabolic disorders. However, their therapeutic efficacy in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and prediabetes remains inconclusive due to heterogeneity in clinical trial results and limited synthesis of human evidence. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate the effects of carnosine and β-alanine supplementation on patients with prediabetes and T2DM. We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase from inception to 9 October 2024 for randomized controlled trials that compared carnosine or β-alanine supplementation to placebo in prediabetic and diabetic populations. The quality of evidence was appraised using the Jadad scale, and the risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Data were analyzed using RevMan and Stata, employing fixed-effects models and I-V methods. Eight trials met the inclusion criteria, totaling 377 participants. Our analysis indicated that supplementation significantly reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG) (SMD: -0.53; 95% CI: -0.75 to -0.31; p < 0.00001) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels (SMD:-0.36; 95% CI:-0.59 to -0.12; p = 0.003) compared to placebo. No significant effects were observed on body mass index (BMI), fasting insulin. low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), but a lowering effect was observed in total cholesterol (TC). Notably, Homeostasis Model Assessment of Beta-cell Function (HOMA-β) values were improved, suggesting enhanced β-cell function, while changes in homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) did not reach statistical significance.

40990181,Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for distal symmetrical peripheral neuropathy in adults with diabetes mellitus.,"Diffuse distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSPN) is a common complication in people living with diabetes mellitus. There is currently no effective treatment for DSPN. There is a biological rationale that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may modify peripheral nerve function in DSPN. However, there is a lack of certainty about the potential benefits and harms of omega-3 PUFAs as a treatment for DSPN. To evaluate the benefits and harms of oral omega-3 PUFA supplements as a treatment for DSPN in adults with diabetes mellitus, compared to placebo or no treatment. We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and two clinical trials registries, together with reference checking, to identify studies eligible for inclusion in the review. The latest search date was 12 June 2024. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults with type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or impaired glucose tolerance who had evidence of DSPN, that compared omega-3 PUFA supplements with placebo treatments or no treatment. We excluded studies with an intervention period of less than 180 days. Our critical outcome was peripheral neuropathy impairment at six months after treatment. Other main outcomes were: symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, pain, quality of life, and adverse events, including any adverse events; adverse events leading to discontinuation of the intervention; and serious adverse events. We recorded outcomes as change from baseline, or the study endpoint measure, if change from baseline data were not reported. We used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool to assess bias in the included RCTs. We synthesised results for each outcome using meta-analysis where possible (inverse variance, random-effects model). Where this was not possible due to the nature of the data, we synthesised the results by summarising effect estimates. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the body of the evidence for each key outcome. This review included two completed RCTs that collectively involved 87 participants. Based on findings from one study (43 participants with type 1 diabetes), oral omega-3 PUFA supplementation for six months may have little to no effect on the short-term risk of developing peripheral neuropathy impairment (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.94; low-certainty evidence), peripheral neuropathy symptoms (MD -0.17, 95% CI -1.36 to 1.02; low-certainty evidence), or health-related quality of life (MD 0.02, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.10; low-certainty evidence), compared to a placebo treatment. From two studies (pooled estimates from outcomes reported for 78 participants), there may be little or no difference between omega-3 PUFA and placebo supplementation with respect to the risk of developing any adverse event (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.61; P = 0.88; very low-certainty evidence) or a serious adverse event (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.85; P = 0.27; very low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. The included studies did not report data on pain outcomes or adverse events leading to discontinuation of the treatment. There are inadequate data to draw conclusions about the effects of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on peripheral nerve impairment in adults with diabetes mellitus. There may be little to no benefit of oral omega-3 PUFA treatment, compared to placebo or no treatment, for improving peripheral neuropathy symptoms or health-related quality of life. While no harms of omega-3 PUFA treatment are suggested, more data are needed to elucidate any potential risks. This review did not have dedicated funding.

40959483,Plant-Derived Natural Product-Based Nanoformulations for Healthcare Application.,"Plants produce numerous natural compounds developed into commercial products. These compounds offer medicinal benefits for treating diseases like diabetes, neurological disorders, malaria, and cancer. They also serve as hepatoprotective agents and immunomodulators. These natural products are secondary metabolites that plants produce for their defense and adaptation. Recently, numerous reports have highlighted the effectiveness of natural products in different diseases. However, comprehensive analysis of plant-based products currently used in the clinical setting for various human diseases is insufficient. This review provides extensive information about the application of natural plant products in both clinical and preclinical settings. It highlights their role in developing drugs for human diseases. Additionally, these plant products could serve as diagnostic tools for various diseases. Plant-derived natural products, integrated with advanced nanotechnology-based approaches, could enhance healthcare monitoring without compromising treatment efficacy. Nanotechnology techniques employing both diagnostics and therapeutics, known as nanotheranostics, utilize engineered biocompatible nanomaterials with potential prospects for healthcare management. Nanomaterials like polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes offer diagnostic value by enabling real-time imaging of disease progression and treatment response. Functionalized with contrast agents or dyes, they enhance MRI, CT, PET, and fluorescence imaging, improving diagnosis, patient stratification, and monitoring of drug delivery and efficacy. With the increasing demand for natural dietary supplements, this issue encompasses the identification of various plant-based natural products as potential nanotheranostics with promising potential for chronic disorders such as cancer, neurological pathologies, diabetes, and immunological issues.

During pregnancy and lactation, various changes occur in maternal hormone levels and physiological processes to ensure the most favorable intrauterine environment. These changes may vary depending on factors such as maternal nutritional status and mode of delivery, and they can also lead to alterations in the maternal gut microbiota, breast milk microbiota, and neonatal gut microbiota. In this context, probiotic and prebiotic supplementation is considered to have potential benefits in preventing adverse outcomes during pregnancy and lactation. A literature review reveals that while prebiotic studies remain limited, probiotic research is comparatively more extensive. Current evidence suggests that probiotic, prebiotic, and synbiotic supplementation during pregnancy may exert beneficial effects on the prevention or mitigation of conditions such as gestational diabetes, maternal obesity, atopic dermatitis, and eczema, and positively influencing the composition of the vaginal microbiota. These outcomes are further supported during lactation by positive changes in the breast milk microbiota, improvements in conditions such as mastitis and breast pain, reduced risk of necrotizing enterocolitis, late-onset sepsis, and infantile colic, as well as a decrease in the frequency of infant crying. Although probiotic and prebiotic supplements are considered promising approaches to preventing health problems specific to pregnancy and lactation, there is a need for more methodologically sound, long-term, and randomized controlled studies in this field. Thus, the safety, efficacy, and place of these supplements in clinical practice can be demonstrated.",Açar Kuru Y; Aksu S; Gökler AF; Somuncu Eİ; Yassıbaş E; Ayyıldız F,Current nutrition reports,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40952551/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40944284,Coenzyme Q10 and Cognition: A Review.,"<b>Background and Objective:</b> With an increase in the number of older citizens in most Western countries, cognitive decline is becoming an increasingly significant issue. Numerous age-related metabolic and physiological changes, such as increased inflammation and oxidative stress, decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, poorer cardiovascular function, and reduced cerebral blood flow, have been implicated in cognitive decline, prompting research into interventions. Among these, Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), an antioxidant and metabolic stimulant, has shown promise in improving some of the underlying biological mechanisms of cognitive decline. However, not much is known about the efficacy of CoQ10 supplementation on cognition in the elderly. Therefore, the aim of this review is to explore the efficacy of CoQ10 supplementation on cognitive function. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a review of animal studies and human clinical trials investigating the effect of CoQ10 supplementation on cognition in samples who were healthy or with specific diseases. Overall, twelve studies demonstrated improved cognitive function and two showed a reduction in oxidative stress in response to CoQ10 supplementation, either alone or in combination with other compounds. Out of eight human clinical trials in healthy subjects (n = 2) and disease states (n = 6), four showed evidence of a beneficial effect of CoQ10 supplementation on cognition, while two demonstrated an increase in cerebral blood flow. Disparity in the results of the clinical trials presented here is likely due to differing testing procedures, inconsistent use of cognitive assessments, and/or varying bioavailability of different preparations of CoQ10. <b>Conclusions:</b> There is some evidence to suggest that cognition and the biological mechanisms that regulate it are positively impacted by CoQ10 therapy. However, it is crucial to note that the literature presents mixed results, with many human clinical trials also reporting no benefit of CoQ10 supplementation on cognitive performance. To fully evaluate the benefits of CoQ10 on cognitive function in ageing and in neurodegenerative diseases, future studies are needed that target possible mechanisms and utilise a wider range of cognitive assessments.",Nankivell MC; Rosenfeldt F; Pipingas A; Pase MP; Reddan JM; Stough C,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40944284/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40944248,Creatine Supplementation Combined with Exercise in the Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes: Effects on Insulin Resistance and Sarcopenia.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic disorder marked by insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism, with skeletal muscle being a major site of systemic glucose disposal. This review examines the bidirectional relationship between T2D and sarcopenia, and synthesizes current evidence on how skeletal muscle deterioration and insulin resistance interact to disrupt glucose homeostasis. We summarize molecular mechanisms by which physical exercise enhances glucose uptake via insulin-dependent and insulin-independent pathways, and review the ergogenic and metabolic effects of creatine monohydrate (CrM). We also evaluate studies combining CrM supplementation with resistance or aerobic training and their effects on glycaemic control, muscle mass and function. Overall, combined exercise and creatine supplementation show potential to improve glucose regulation and attenuate muscle loss in older adults and people with T2D. Available data indicate that CrM is well tolerated in healthy and clinical populations when used at recommended doses, with no consistent evidence of adverse renal or hepatic effects. Further large randomized trials are needed to define optimal dosing, training modalities and long-term benefits for metabolic outcomes.",Młynarska E; Leszto K; Katańska K; Prusak A; Wieczorek A; Jakubowska P; Rysz J; Franczyk B,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40944248/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40923398,Vitamins and Iron-Deficiency Gestational Anemia - A Review.,"Vitamins, as essential m icronutrients, are vital for numerous cellular functions and play a key role in maintaining hematological parameter s during pregnancy, including erythropoiesis and processes affecting iron status. Iron-Deficient Gestational Anemia (IDGA), the most common clinicopathological condition in obstetrics and highly prevalent in developing countries, significantly contributes to complications such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and gestational diabetes. While it is recognized that vitamin deficiencies impact iron metabolism and erythropoiesis, a complete understanding of their specific roles in preventing and managing IDGA is lacking. Insights into how vitamin deficiencies influence gene expression and cellular signaling are crucial. With rising IDGA prevalence, ensuring adequate vitamin intake during pregnancy is essential for improving hematological health. Mobile health-based literacy tools can effectively promote patient education to achieve this. This review underscores the critical role of vitamins in regulating hemoglobin levels in IDGA.",Yadav DV; Mitra T; Punniyamoorthy D; Murugesan A; Kumari Raveendran S; Janardhanan R,Journal of dietary supplements,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40923398/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40917224,A possible role for food-based citrus bioactive compounds in bridging the gap between prevalence of diabetes and the effectiveness of current treatments.,"The conventional ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to treating and managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has proven challenging. T2DM is a complex, heterogeneous disease and frequently coexists with other conditions like hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia, further complicating treatment decisions and outcomes. While advances in diabetes medications have been made, traditional treatment algorithms often focus on broad glycemic targets, neglecting the diverse needs of patients with different risk profiles associated with ethnicity, comorbidities, and preferences. Complex treatment regimens involving multiple medications and lifestyle changes can be challenging for patients, resulting in suboptimal outcomes and failure to achieve optimal glycemic targets. Therefore, revisiting existing treatment algorithms for diabetes management and the development of synergistic treatment modalities that may slow or prevent diabetes progression are warranted. This mini review highlights the challenges of mitigating the prevalence of diabetes in at-risk populations and proposes incorporating non-therapeutic interventions such as Integrative Health Products (IHPs). IHPs encompass nutritional bioactives, functional foods, dietary supplements, and botanical compounds that may synergistically complement conventional medical treatments to optimize health and achieve glycemic targets.",Evans M; Lewis E; Joseph A; Crowley D; Guthrie N,Journal of food science and technology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40917224/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40869296,Folic Acid Supplementation and Risk of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review of the Literature.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects approximately 14% of pregnancies globally and has been hypothesized to be influenced by periconceptional and early pregnancy folic acid (FA) supplementation, a practice recommended to prevent neural tube defects. To evaluate this association, we conducted a systematic review of studies published between 2015 and 2024 examining FA use and GDM risk. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria, including ten cohort studies and two case-control studies. While findings were mixed, several prospective studies suggested that high daily FA intake (≥800 μg) or prolonged use (>3-6 months) may be associated with increased odds of GDM, especially when initiated preconceptionally. Conversely, standard-dose supplementation (≈400 μg) appeared neutral or potentially protective in some populations. Notably, high folate status combined with low vitamin B12 was linked to increased GDM risk, suggesting metabolic interaction. Overall, most studies were of moderate to high methodological quality. Although current evidence is inconclusive, these results support cautious use of high-dose FA supplementation and the importance of individualized prenatal nutrition, particularly considering B12 status. Further research is needed to clarify biological mechanisms.",Gómez-Cabrera AS; González-Santiago AE; Castañeda-Arellano R; Corona-Meraz FI; Baptista-Rosas RC; Sánchez-Parada MG,International journal of molecular sciences,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40869296/,0,1,0,0,0,0

These inconsistencies may stem from factors such as dosage, intervention duration, and study design. To address these discrepancies, this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to evaluate the effects of okra ( Abelmoschus esculentus ) supplementation on diabetes and obesity markers in patients with type 2 diabetes. Relevant studies published up to July 15, 2024, were identified through comprehensive searches in databases including Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed/Medline, and Embase. Studies were included if they assessed the effects of okra supplementation on diabetes and obesity biomarkers in patients with type 2 diabetes. A random-effects model was employed to calculate effect sizes, reported as weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A total of six eligible RCTs was included in the final analysis. The meta-analysis revealed that okra supplementation significantly reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG) (WMD: -21.72 mg/dL, 95% CI: -36.86 to -6.58, p = 0.005) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels (WMD: -0.42%, 95% CI: -0.64 to -0.19, p < 0.001). However, no significant effects were observed on insulin levels (WMD: 0.54 μU/mL, 95% CI: -1.03 to 2.12, p = 0.498), insulin resistance as assessed by HOMA-IR (WMD: -0.31, 95% CI: -1.37 to 0.75, p = 0.566), body mass index (BMI) (WMD: -0.24 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95% CI: -0.62 to 0.14, p = 0.220), or body weight (WMD: -0.83 kg, 95% CI: -2.55 to 0.87, p = 0.338).

40842498,The efficacy of saffron supplementation on inflammation and oxidative stress in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis.,"In this study, a meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the changes in the levels of inflammation and oxidative stress levels in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients after saffron supplementation. A comprehensive and systematic investigation was carried out to identify relevant studies on PubMed, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases. The investigation aimed to find studies that tested the efficacy of saffron supplements in reducing inflammation and oxidative stress in people with type 2 diabetes. The data were synthesized using Revman 5.4 software to perform a meta-analysis. A total of five relevant articles involving 261 patients were included. The meta-analysis results demonstrated a significant reduction in TNF-α levels following saffron supplementation compared to the placebo group. However, no significant changes were observed in the levels of CRP levels (SMD: 0.01, 95% CI: -0.52 to 0.05, p = 0.97), IL-10 levels (SMD: 0.31, 95% CI: -0.05 to 0.67, p = 0.09), IL-6 levels (SMD: -0.28, 95% CI: -0.79 to 0.24, p = 0.29), MDA levels (SMD: 0.01, 95% CI: -0.28 to 0.30, p = 0.95), and TAC levels (SMD: -0.09, 95% CI: -0.42 to 0.24, p = 0.59). The findings of this meta-analysis provide compelling evidence to support the efficacy of saffron supplementation in reducing the effects of TNF-α levels in individuals with T2DM. Nevertheless, the present body of research is still limited in its ability to establish the precise impact of saffron supplementation on oxidative stress and other inflammatory factors in T2DM patients.",Qin L; Hu N; Wang K; Chen L,Frontiers in endocrinology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40842498/,0,1,0,1,0,0
40842160,A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials on the Impact of Resveratrol Supplementation on Anthropometric Indices in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.,"Some evidence suggests that resveratrol may have anti-obesity effects on diabetic patients; while other studies have not confirmed this claim. This study aimed to systematically review the literature and evaluate the impact of resveratrol supplementation on body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and hip circumference (HC) in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We conducted comprehensive searches in electronic databases such as Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library up to February 2023. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including adult T2D patients who received resveratrol supplementation and reported at least one anthropometric measure. Two independent researchers performed data extraction and quality assessment. We determined overall effect sizes using a random-effects model and assessed heterogeneity using the I <sup>2</sup> statistic and Cochrane's Q test. A total of 11 trials with 614 participants were included. The pooled effect size showed that taking resveratrol supplements significantly decreased body weight (WMD: -0.44 kg, 95% CI: -0.88 to -0.00, p = 0.048), BMI (WMD: -0.19 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95% CI: -0.37 to -0.01, p = 0.03), and WC (WMD: -0.80 cm, 95% CI: -1.35 to -0.24, p = 0.005). However, we did not find any significant effects on HC or WHR. This meta-analysis revealed significant reductions in body weight, BMI, and WC among T2D patients who consumed resveratrol. However, there was no significant effect on HC and WHR. Further high-quality, long-term studies are necessary to confirm these findings.",Lahouti M; Arzhang P; Azadbakht L,Phytotherapy research : PTR,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40842160/,0,1,0,1,0,0
40836314,The Efficacy of Zinc Supplementation Alone or in Combination for Improving Pregnancy and Infant Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"To evaluate zinc supplementation's efficacy in pregnancy, addressing gaps in previous reviews regarding high-risk subgroups and combination therapies. Systematic review of six databases through March 27, 2025 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on prenatal zinc supplementation. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2. Stratified analyses was conducted by participant or intervention characteristics, with meta-analysis or qualitative synthesis when appropriate. Sensitivity analyses was conducted by excluding studies with high risk of bias. The systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023440314). 77 RCTs were included. Compared with no zinc, zinc monotherapy among healthy pregnant women resulted in higher serum zinc level (standard mean difference (SMD) <sub>the second trimester</sub> = 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.44; SMD<sub>the third trimester</sub> = 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.76), lower fetal intrauterine retardation rate (risk ratio = 0.23, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.35), longer neonatal birth length (SMD = 0.66, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.12), bigger birth head circumference (SMD = 0.58, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.09), higher 1-min Apgar score (SMD = 0.28, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.49) and cord blood zinc level (SMD = 0.36, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.56). No additional benefits observed with zinc-iron-folate combinations versus iron-folate alone. Qualitative synthesis of limited evidence suggested potential benefits for high-risk groups (anemia, gestational diabetes, zinc deficiency or impaired intravenous glucose tolerance test). Zinc monotherapy may benefit healthy pregnancies and high-risk groups, but combination regimens show no additional advantages.

40818820,The efficacy of dietary interventions for prediabetes management: An umbrella review of meta-analyses.,"Literature suggested that prediabetes may be reversible through dietary interventions. Despite numerous meta-analyses evaluating the efficacies of dietary intervention strategies, there is a lack of umbrella review to gather published meta-analyses, then to assess their reliability and strength of evidence. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on dietary interventions for adults with prediabetes were collected from Embase, Emcare, MEDLINE, Ovid Nursing, and CNKI. Meta-analyses with at least 3 independent RCTs were selected to re-estimate random-effects pooled effect sizes. Credibility of evidence was assessed using AMSTAR 2 and NutriGrade. Nine meta-analyses comprising 45 comparisons and 10,814 participants were included. Among the dietary interventions examined, Vitamin D supplementation led to reduced fasting blood glucose (SMD: -0.377, 95 % CI: -0.598 to -0.165), decreased blood triglycerides (SMD: -0.385, 95 % CI: -0.622 to -0.147), reduced risk of T2D onset (RR: 0.897, 95 % CI: 0.810-0.994), and increased likelihood of reverting to normoglycemia (RR: 1.238, 95 % CI: 1.074-1.425). Prebiotic supplementation significantly reduced body fat (SMD: -1.271, 95 % CI: -2.326 to -0.216). Fructose replacement significantly reduced postprandial plasma glucose levels compared to glucose (SMD: -8.275, 95 % CI: -12.663 to -3.887) and sucrose (SMD: -5.176, 95 % CI: -9.558 to -0.793). However, the credibility of the evidence was limited by small sample sizes and heterogeneity. While several dietary interventions that improve cardiometabolic health of individuals with prediabetes were identified, the credibility of evidence is weak.

In this systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, the impact of turmeric/curcumin supplementation on anthropometric indices in individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was assessed. PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched to identify relevant records published from 1 January 1990 to 1 June 2024. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI), with a p-value ≤ 0.05 indicating statistical significance. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to assess the certainty of evidence. Twenty randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled analysis displayed that supplementation with turmeric/curcumin significantly decreased body weight (WMD: -1.9 kg; 95% CI: -2.9 to -0.9; P ≤ 0.001; GRADE = low), waist circumference (WMD: -1.9 cm; 95% CI: -3.5 to -0.2; P = 0.024; GRADE = low), fat mass% (WMD: -2.9%; 95% CI: -5.6 to -0.1, P = 0.041; GRADE = very low), and hip circumference (WMD: -1.0 cm; 95% CI: -1.2 to -0.8; P ≤ 0.001; GRADE = moderate) but no effects on body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio in people with T2DM. In individuals with prediabetes, body weight (WMD: -2.5 kg; 95% CI: -4.8 to -0.2; P = 0.037; GRADE = moderate) and waist circumference (WMD: -2.9 cm; 95% CI: -5.3 to -0.6; P = 0.015; GRADE = moderate) were significantly lower in the turmeric/curcumin supplement-treated group than their untreated counterparts.

40806262,Current Data on the Role of Amino Acids in the Management of Obesity in Children and Adolescents.,"Childhood obesity is a major global health problem, and its management involves a multidisciplinary approach that includes lifestyle changes, dietary interventions, and the use of dietary supplements. In this review, we summarize current findings on the role of amino acids in pediatric obesity, with a particular focus on their involvement in metabolic pathways and weight regulation. The involvement of branched-chain and aromatic amino acids in the pathophysiology and potential management of pediatric obesity is highlighted in recent studies. Both experimental and clinical studies have shown that obese children often exhibit altered plasma amino acid profiles, including increased levels of leucine, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine, as well as decreased levels of glycine and serine. These imbalances are correlated with insulin resistance, inflammation, and early metabolic dysfunction. One of the mechanisms through which branched-chain amino acids can promote insulin resistance is the activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Metabolomic profiling has demonstrated the potential of specific amino acid patterns to predict obesity-related complications before they become clinically evident. Early identification of these biomarkers could be of great help for individualized interventions. Although clinical studies indicate that changes in dietary amino acids could lead to modest weight loss, improved metabolic profiles, and increased satiety, further studies are needed to establish standardized recommendations.",Zamosteanu D; Filip N; Trandafir LM; Ţarcă E; Pertea M; Bordeianu G; Bernic J; Heredea AM; Cojocaru E,International journal of molecular sciences,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40806262/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40806143,The Role of Vitamin K Deficiency in Chronic Kidney Disease-A Scoping Review.,"<b>Background/objectives</b>: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects up to 15% of the global population and is driven by vascular and interstitial damage, and is most prevalent in persons with hypertension and diabetes. Vitamin K, a necessary cofactor for activation of vitamin K-dependent proteins may modulate these processes. It is well established that vitamin K deficiency is associated with CKD, but the therapeutic effects of supplementation on kidney function are still uncertain. We aimed to review the current evidence on the effect of vitamin K deficiency and supplementation on any marker of renal function and kidney disease, across general adult populations and CKD patient populations. <b>Methods</b>: A search was conducted in PubMed, targeting terms related to vitamin K status and CKD. Studies were included if they reported data on vitamin K status or supplementation in relation to kidney function outcomes. <b>Results</b>: A total of 16 studies were included. Nine interventional studies were included and confirmed that vitamin K supplementation improves biomarkers of vitamin K status but showed no consistent beneficial effects on renal function. Seven observational studies across populations found significant associations between vitamin K status and decline in kidney function; however, associations were often attenuated after adjustments. <b>Conclusions</b>: No clear effect of supplementation was observed on the reported kidney markers in patient populations. A clear association between low vitamin K status and impaired kidney function was confirmed. Studying heterogeneity makes the comparability and generalizability of the results difficult.

40806128,Role of Micronutrient Supplementation in Promoting Cognitive Healthy Aging in Latin America: Evidence-Based Consensus Statement.,"<b>Background:</b> Cognitive decline is a growing public health concern in Latin America, driven by rapid aging, widespread micronutrient inadequacies, and socioeconomic disparities. Despite the recognized importance of nutrition, many older adults struggle to meet daily dietary micronutrients requirements, increasing the risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study aimed to establish expert consensus on the role of Multivitamin and Mineral supplements (MVMs) in promoting cognitive healthy aging among older adults in Latin America. <b>Methods:</b> A panel of nine experts in geriatrics, neurology, and nutrition applied a modified Delphi methodology to generate consensus statements. The panel reviewed the literature, engaged in expert discussions, and used structured voting to develop consensus statements. <b>Results:</b> Consensus was reached on 14 statements. Experts agreed that cognitive aging in Latin America is influenced by neurobiological, lifestyle, and socioeconomic factors, including widespread micronutrient inadequacies (vitamins B-complex, C, D, E, and minerals such as zinc, magnesium, chromium, copper, iron and selenium), which were identified as critical for global cognitive function and brain structures, yet commonly inadequate in the elderly. While a balanced diet remains essential, MVMs can be recommended as a complementary strategy to bridge nutritional gaps. Supporting evidence, including the COSMOS-Mind trials, demonstrate that MVM use improves memory and global cognition, and reduces cognitive aging by up to 2 years in older adults. <b>Conclusions:</b> MVMs offer a promising, accessible adjunct for cognitive healthy aging in Latin America's elderly population, particularly where dietary challenges persist. Region-specific guidelines, public health initiatives, and targeted research are warranted to optimize outcomes and reduce health inequities.",Nogueira-de-Almeida CA; Gutiérrez CAC; Ramos LR; Katz M; Gonzalez MM; Angel Badillo B; Gómez Santa María OA; Reyes Torres CA; O'Neill S; Reyes MG; Mustapic L,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40806128/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40806117,Influence of Matcha and Tea Catechins on the Progression of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD)-A Review of Patient Trials and Animal Studies.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MASLD) is a chronic, non-communicable spectrum of diseases characterized by lipid accumulation. It is often asymptomatic, and its prevalence varies by region, age, gender, and economic status. It is estimated that 25% of the world's population currently suffer from MAFLD, and 20 million patients will die from MAFLD-related diseases. In the last 20 years, tea and anti-obesity research have indicated that regularly consuming tea decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome (MeS). In this review, we aimed to present studies concerning the influence of matcha extracts and epigallocatechin-3 gallate (EGCG) supplements on metabolic functions in the context of MAFLD in human and animal studies. The published data show promise. In both human and animal studies, the beneficial effects on body weight, cholesterol levels, and liver metabolism and function were noted, even in short-period experiments. The safety levels for EGCG and green tea extract consumption are marked. More experiments are needed to confirm the results observed in animal studies and to show the mechanisms by which green tea exerts its effects. The preliminary data from research concerning microbiota or epigenetic changes observed after polyphenols and green tea consumption need to be expanded. To improve the efficiency and availability of green tea or supplement consumption as a treatment for MAFLD patients, more research with larger groups and longer study durations is needed.",Kosik-Bogacka DI; Piotrowska K,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40806117/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40806075,"The Impact of Vitamin D Supplementation on Fasting Plasma Glucose, Insulin Sensitivity, and Inflammation in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Vitamin D supplementation has shown promise in managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), while the simultaneous impact on glycemic control and inflammation in T2DM remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the potential role of vitamin D supplementation in managing T2DM using fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin levels, HOMA-IR, HOMA-B, HbA1c, and Hs-CRP as the biomarkers. <b>Methods</b>: Original articles from Scopus, Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Epistemonikos, and ScienceDirect published between 2014 and 2024 were the sources. Inclusion criteria included studies conducted as clinical trials or randomized controlled trials involving adult patients diagnosed with T2DM undergoing treatment with vitamin D. The risk of bias was evaluated using the ROB-2 tool and meta-analysis was conducted to quantitatively synthesize the results across the studies using pooled effect sizes and confidence intervals. <b>Results</b>: Nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. Significant differences were found at 12-week follow-up in insulin level (MD(-3.59) [95% CI: -6.93, -0.25]), HOMA-B (MD(-50.35) [95% CI: -92.29, -8.41]), hs-CRP (-2.51 [95% CI: -3.45, -1.57]), and HbA1c level (MD(-0.30) [95% CI: -0.54, -0.06]) and at 24-week follow-up in HOMA-IR (MD(-0.38) [CI: -0.53, -0.24]). The quality of the included studies was generally moderate, with three showing a potential risk of bias. <b>Conclusions</b>: The observed trends in FPG, insulin levels, HOMA-IR, HOMA-B, HbA1c, and hs-CRP indicate that vitamin D may influence glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, and inflammation, but these effects are often modest and may diminish over time. Future studies should explore longer duration randomized trials with standardized dosing and baseline vitamin D status stratification.",Probosari E; Subagio HW; Rachmawati B; Muis SF; Tjandra KC; Adiningsih D; Winarni TI,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40806075/,0,1,0,1,0,1
40803102,"Effects of isolated single fibers, fiber mixtures, and fiber-rich whole foods on glucose homeostasis in individuals with overweight and obesity: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","Increasing evidence from epidemiological studies indicates that dietary fibers are protective against the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Supplementation of dietary fiber may therefore be a strategy to improve metabolic health in individuals with overweight and obesity at high risk to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, results from intervention studies are inconsistent, which may be related to the form of supplementation. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluated randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of dietary fiber administered as single isolated fibers, mixtures of isolated fibers, or fiber-rich whole foods on markers of insulin resistance and glucose homeostasis in individuals with overweight or obesity without T2DM. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Embase databases were searched for RCTs comparing the effects of fiber supplementation with placebo treatments on glucose homeostasis. Changes in outcome parameters were analyzed using random effects meta-analyses to estimate effect size and 95 % confidence intervals (CI). A total of 51 eligible papers (n = 3420 participants) with a study duration between one and twelve months were included in the meta-analysis. Dietary fiber supplementation improved fasting glucose concentrations -0.07 mmol/L (95 % CI: -0.12, -0.02; P = 0.0005; I<sup>2</sup> = 54 %), reduced fasting insulin levels -5.89 pmol/L (95 % CI -9.18, -2.60, P = 0.0004; I<sup>2</sup> = 89 %), and decreased HOMA-IR -0.38 (95 % CI: -0.68, -0.08; P < 0.00001; I<sup>2</sup> = 94 %). In addition, subgroup analysis revealed that supplementation of single fibers improved fasting insulin, Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and insulin area under the curve (AUC). Isolated fiber mixtures in addition reduced fasting glucose but not insulin AUC. Supplementation of whole foods only improved HbA1c. Dietary fiber supplementation improved glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in individuals with overweight and obesity without T2DM. Although differential effects were observed based on the form of fiber supplementation, no form of fiber supplementation could be considered superior. The study was registered in PROSPERO as CRD42023427415.",Colak H; Larik GNF; van Baak MA; Canfora EE,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40803102/,0,1,0,1,0,0
40792481,Vitamin D supplementation in pregnant or breastfeeding women or young children for preventing asthma.,"Randomised controlled studies evaluating vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy or early childhood for preventing childhood asthma have yielded inconclusive results. Previous systematic reviews of vitamin D for asthma prevention focused on studies comparing vitamin D to placebo or studies intervening in pregnancy, limiting the body of evidence. Primary: to evaluate the efficacy of any vitamin D supplementation and high-dose vitamin D supplementation in early life, including the prenatal period, for preventing asthma in children. Secondary: to assess the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation: • for preventing asthma in children at risk of vitamin D deficiency at the start of the trial or whose mothers were at risk; • by intervention timing and the cumulative dose administered; • in preventing factors associated with early childhood asthma, including atopic dermatitis, respiratory tract infections, sensitisation to allergens, and airway inflammation. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the Cochrane Airways and Skin Trial Registers. We checked the reference lists of relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We contacted authors to obtain additional study information as needed. Date of last search: October 2023. We included randomised controlled studies comparing higher versus lower/standard dose vitamin D (≤ 400 international units (IU)/day) or any vitamin D versus placebo/no treatment in generally healthy pregnant or lactating women or children up to five years of age that evaluated childhood asthma, wheeze, atopic dermatitis, airway infections, allergic sensitisation, and airway inflammation. We excluded trials recruiting populations with pre-existing conditions. We followed standard Cochrane methodological procedures, including using Cochrane's Screen4Me workflow. We considered participants rather than events as the unit of analysis, performed fixed-effect meta-analysis, and reported risk ratios (RRs) or mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for four comparisons: (1) any vitamin D versus placebo/no supplementation in pregnant or breastfeeding women; (2) any vitamin D versus placebo/no supplementation in infants or children; (3) high versus low/standard dose vitamin D in pregnant or breastfeeding women; (4) high versus low/standard dose vitamin D in infants or children. Our outcomes were: asthma, wheeze, atopic dermatitis, airway infections, allergic sensitisation, airway inflammation, and adverse events. We narratively described results that could not be meta-analysed. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB) to assess bias in the studies. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We included 18 studies involving a total of 10,611 participants, of which 16 contributed data to meta-analyses. Studies were conducted around the world, with most taking place in higher-income countries. The dose and frequency of vitamin D ranged from 200 IU/day to 100,000 IU bolus quarterly, and the duration of supplementation ranged from 28 days to two years. Comparison 1. Any vitamin D versus placebo/no supplementation in pregnant or breastfeeding women (4 studies) Compared to placebo or no supplementation, any vitamin D given to pregnant or breastfeeding women may reduce the risk of early childhood asthma (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.61; 1 study, 236 participants; low-certainty evidence) and likely has little to no effect on childhood airway infections (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.04; 3 studies, 1564 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain for wheeze, atopic dermatitis, allergic sensitisation, airway inflammation, or adverse events. Comparison 2. Any vitamin D versus placebo/no supplementation in infants or children (5 studies) Compared to placebo or no supplementation, any vitamin D given to infants or children may have little to no effect on childhood wheeze (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.16; 2 studies, 431 participants; low-certainty evidence), atopic dermatitis (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.28; 2 studies, 448 participants; low-certainty evidence), airway infections (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.01; 2 studies, 500 participants; low-certainty evidence), allergic sensitisation (RR 2.25, 95% CI 0.60 to 8.50; 1 study, 228 participants; low-certainty evidence), or airway inflammation measured by eosinophil counts (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.74; 1 study, 226 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain for asthma and adverse events. Comparison 3. High versus low/standard dose vitamin D in pregnant or breastfeeding women (4 studies) Compared to low/standard dose, high-dose vitamin D given to pregnant or breastfeeding women likely reduces the risk of childhood wheeze (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.98; 3 studies, 1439 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), but likely results in little to no difference in childhood asthma, although the direction and magnitude of effect is similar to that for wheeze (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.04; 2 studies, 1355 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Compared to low/standard dose, high-dose vitamin D in pregnancy likely has little to no effect on childhood atopic dermatitis (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.11; 3 studies, 1439 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), airway infections (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.11; 3 studies, 1441 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), or allergic sensitisation (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.18; 2 studies, 1110 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain for adverse events. No studies evaluated airway inflammation. Comparison 4. High versus low/standard dose vitamin D in infants or children (7 studies) Compared to low/standard dose, high-dose vitamin D given to infants or children may slightly reduce airway infections (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.98; 6 studies, 2385 participants; low-certainty evidence) but may have little to no effect on atopic dermatitis (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05; 1 study, 769 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain for asthma, wheeze, allergic sensitisation, and adverse events. No studies evaluated airway inflammation. Evidence supporting a protective effect of vitamin D supplementation in early life, including the prenatal period, on childhood asthma is limited. Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that high-dose vitamin D in pregnancy likely helps prevent childhood wheeze. Evidence for the effects of vitamin D in early childhood on asthma or wheeze is less certain. Additional high-quality studies, especially in infants and children, are needed to establish with any certainty the effects of vitamin D supplementation on childhood asthma and associated factors.",Patchen BK; Best CM; Boiteau J; Solvik BS; Vonderschmidt A; Xu J; Cohen RT; Cassano PA,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40792481/,0,1,0,1,0,0
40778989,Effects of omega-3 fatty acids on skeletal muscle vascular health and metabolism.,"This review aims to summarise recent findings on the effects of omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) on skeletal muscle vascular and metabolic health. We particularly focus on macrovascular (large blood vessel) outcomes, skeletal muscle microvascular (capillary) blood flow and skeletal muscle health and metabolism. Recent meta-analysis and intervention studies suggest that omega-3 FAs improve macrovascular health outcomes in humans by enhancing endothelial function, reducing arterial stiffness and by increasing nitric oxide bioavailability. However, the benefits on macrovascular outcomes are more evident in clinical populations than in healthy individuals. In terms of dose, more than 1 g/day of omega-3 FA appear to be more beneficial than less than 1 g/day. In contrast to macrovascular outcomes, the effect of omega-3 FAs on skeletal muscle microvascular outcomes remains undetermined, demonstrating a significant gap in the field. In terms of skeletal muscle health and metabolism, omega-3 FAs improve muscle strength and ameliorate postprandial blood glucose levels in healthy individuals. The anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3 FAs also appear to benefit muscle health and metabolism. Omega-3 FAs have a positive effect on macrovascular outcomes, muscle metabolism and health, specifically in clinical populations. The direct effects of omega-3 FAs on muscle microvascular outcomes in both healthy and clinical populations need to be determined.",Karimi E; Keske MA; Beba M; Kaur G,Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40778989/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40751398,Investigating the Effects of Vaccinium myrtillus Supplementation on Cardiometabolic Indices: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Chronic diseases cause early death and financial strain worldwide. Cardio-metabolic health, crucial for preventing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, may benefit from bilberry's antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This meta-analysis reviews studies of bilberry's impact on lipid profiles, glycemic indices, body composition, and inflammatory and oxidative factors. Inclusion criteria were randomized clinical trials assessing bilberry supplementation in adults for at least 1 week. A comprehensive review of literature was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar until July 21, 2024, without any time limitations. Mean changes and their SDs were used to calculate overall effect sizes, with the Hozo et al. method converting SEs, 95% CIs, and IQRs to SDs. A random-effects model accounted for between-study variations. Eleven RCTs, including 409 individuals, were incorporated into the present systematic review, and 8 were included in the meta-analysis. Combining five effect sizes from the five trials on long-term effects of bilberry administration compared with controls resulted in a non-significant decrease in FBG (WMD: -0.08 mmol/L, 95% CI: -0.22 to 0.07, p = 0.30). For HbA1c, the meta-analysis of three RCTs showed a marginally significant reduction (WMD: -1.63%, 95% CI: -3.36% to 0.11%, p = 0.06). The results of the meta-analysis on lipid profile showed a decreasing trend, although this reduction was not statistically significant for TC (WMD: -0.11 mmol/L, 95% CI: -0.30% to 0.08%, p = 0.27) or TG (WMD: -0.07 mmol/L, 95% CI: -0.32% to 0.19%, p = 0.62). However, a significant change in TG was reported in trials with a crossover design and RCTs with 4 weeks of intervention or less. Although HDL level did not show any significant change (WMD: -0.02 mmol/L, 95% CI: -0.10% to 0.07%, p = 0.70), the meta-analysis of five RCTs evaluating the long-term effects of bilberry supplementation revealed a significant change in LDL following bilberry supplementation (WMD: 0.07 mmol/L, 95% CI: 0.01%-0.14%, p = 0.01). Furthermore, no significant reduction was observed in SBP (WMD: -2.75 mmHg, 95% CI: -6.38% to 0.89%, p = 0.13) or DBP (WMD: -1.00 mmHg, 95% CI: -4.66% to 2.65%, p = 0.59) after bilberry supplementation. Finally, anthropometric indices including body weight (WMD: 0.04 Kg, 95% CI: -0.44% to 0.53%, p = 0.86) and inflammatory and oxidative stress markers including hs-CRP (WMD: -8.22 mg/L, 95% CI: -20.24% to 3.81%, p = 0.18), IL-6 (WMD: -7.19 pg/mL, 95% CI: -19.01% to 4.63%, p = 0.23), uric acid (WMD: -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI: -0.03% to 0.01%, p = 0.36), and FRAP (WMD: -42.03 μmol/L, 95% CI: -100.54% to 16.48%, p = 0.16) showed no significant change after bilberry supplementation. Bilberry supplementation may have beneficial effects on HbA1c and TG, but not other cardio-metabolic indices. Therefore, long-term and high-quality trials are needed to confirm the promising effects of bilberries.",Talebi S; Shirani M; Mahdavi A; Bagherniya M; Sahebkar A,Phytotherapy research : PTR,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40751398/,0,1,0,1,0,0
40738717,Micronutrient status of patients with diabetic foot: A systematic review.,"Micronutrient status encompasses a range of indicators that reflect the levels and balance of macro- and microelements, as well as vitamins within the body. These essential substances, required in minimal amounts, are crucial for supporting normal physiological processes, immune system functioning, and tissue repair. The aim of this systematic review is to summarize data on the deficiency or excess of microelements, macroelements, and vitamins in patients with diabetic foot ulcers. Databases were searched for studies on vitamin, macronutrient, micronutrient levels and their impact on the course, treatment and healing of diabetic foot ulcers. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was employed for assessing randomized trials, while the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was utilized for evaluating observa-tional studies in terms of quality and bias risk. The findings revealed a notable correlation between deficiencies in vitamins D, C, A and the severity of clinical symptoms. Low vitamin D levels were linked to elevated proinflammatory cytokines. Higher concentrations of folate and vitamin B-12 were associated with improved ulcer healing, supplementation with zinc and magnesium contributed to a reduction in ulcer size. Inadequate intake of zinc, vitamins E, C was found to compromise antioxidant defences. Elevated ferritin levels may serve as an indicator of inflammation. The most important task is to adjust the in-take of micronutrients to maintain balance and prevent deficiency and excess, which is important in the complex therapy of patients.",Batarbekova S; Zhunussova D; Derbissalina G; Bekbergenova Z; Maksimova N; Umbetzhanova A; Kelimberdiyeva E; Kassymova R; Kuanyshbayeva G; Imangaliyeva A,Asia Pacific journal of clinical nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40738717/,0,1,0,0,0,0
40732980,Systematic Review of Nutritional Guidelines for the Management of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A Global Comparison.,"<b>Background:</b> Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects 7-9% of pregnancies worldwide and is associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Nutritional therapy is a key component of GDM management. However, inconsistencies exist across international and national guidelines regarding macronutrient distribution, glycemic targets, and micronutrient supplementation. This systematic review aims to compare updated nutritional recommendations for GDM across major health organizations and identify areas of consensus, divergence, and evidence gaps. <b>Methods:</b> This systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines and registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251026194). A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar (concluding March 2025), along with manual searches of official websites of professional health organizations (e.g., ADA, WHO, NICE, IDF). Guidelines published within the last 10 years (or the most relevant national guideline if slightly older), available in English or with access to translation, and including explicit nutritional recommendations for GDM were included. Data were extracted on macronutrient composition, glycemic targets, and micronutrient supplementation, with evaluation of the supporting evidence and regional context, incorporating findings from recent key guideline updates. <b>Results:</b> In total, 12 guidelines met the inclusion criteria. While all guidelines emphasized carbohydrate moderation and adequate fiber intake, significant discrepancies were found in carbohydrate quality recommendations (e.g., low-glycemic index focus vs. total carbohydrate restriction), postprandial glucose targets (e.g., 1-h vs. 2-h measurements and varying thresholds like <120 vs. <140 mg/dL), and the use of non-routine micronutrients such as chromium, selenium, and omega-3 fatty acids (generally lacking endorsement). Recent updates from key bodies like ADA, Diabetes Canada, and KDA largely maintain these core stances but show increasing emphasis on dietary patterns and acknowledgement of CGM technology, without resolving key discrepancies. Cultural adaptability and behavioral counselling strategies were minimally addressed across most guidelines. <b>Conclusions:</b> Despite general agreement on the principal recommendations of nutritional management in GDM, substantial variation persists in specific recommendations, even considering recent updates. Consistent, evidence-based, and culturally adaptable guidelines incorporating implementation strategies are needed to optimize care and reduce disparities in GDM management across regions.",Sirico A; Vastarella MG; Ruggiero E; Cobellis L,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40732980/,0,1,0,0,0,0

40698248,The effect of melatonin supplementation on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.,"Melatonin supplementation has shown potential benefits in the management of diabetes in clinical trials; however, prior meta-analyses have not specifically focused on individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study investigates the efficacy of melatonin supplementation in improving glycemic control among patients with T2DM by systematically reviewing and analyzing data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase from their inception to September 2024. RCTs evaluating the effects of melatonin supplementation in adults diagnosed with T2DM were included. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Data were synthesized and analyzed using RevMan version 5.3. A total of nine RCTs were included in the meta-analysis (n=9). These studies collectively involved 427 participants. Melatonin supplementation was associated with a statistically significant reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels compared to placebo [mean difference [MD]: -0.65; 95% CI: -1.28, -0.02; P = 0.04], However, no significant effect was observed on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels [mean difference: -6.40; 95% CI: -15.79, 2.99; P = 0.18]. This meta-analysis suggests that melatonin supplementation significantly reduces HbA1c levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared to placebo, indicating potential benefits for long-term glycemic control.

40647296,Impact of Probiotic/Synbiotic Supplementation on Post-Bariatric Surgery Anthropometric and Cardiometabolic Outcomes: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"Bariatric surgery improves weight and metabolic health in individuals with severe obesity; however, challenges like gut dysbiosis and nutrient deficiencies persist postoperatively. Probiotic supplementation may enhance recovery by modulating gut microbiota. This updated meta-analysis aimed to assess the effects of probiotics/synbiotics on metabolic, anthropometric, and nutritional outcomes after bariatric surgery. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted using PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and CENTRAL through December 2024. Studies comparing probiotics/synbiotics (which contain both probiotics and prebiotics) versus a placebo in adults post-bariatric surgery were included. Meta-analyses were conducted, with subgroup analyses by surgery type, the timing of the intervention, and probiotic formulation (PROSPERO ID: CRD420251019199). Thirteen RCTs involving 809 patients were included in the analysis. Probiotic use significantly reduced BMI (MD = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.33 to 1.00), HbA1c (MD = -0.19%, 95% CI: -0.36 to -0.01), triglycerides (MD = -16.56 mg/dL), and AST levels (MD = -3.68 U/L), while increasing ALP (MD = 8.12 U/L) and vitamin D (MD = 13.68 pg/mL). Ferritin levels were significantly lower (MD = -18.89 µg/L) in the probiotic group. A subgroup analysis showed enhanced benefits in patients undergoing mini-gastric bypass, with perioperative or synbiotic interventions specifically improving triglycerides, total cholesterol, and HbA1c. Probiotics may offer modest but significant improvements in BMI, glycemic control, lipid profile, liver enzymes, and vitamin D levels after bariatric surgery. These findings support the potential role of probiotics/synbiotics as an adjunct therapy, though further large-scale trials are warranted to confirm long-term benefits.",Rakab MS; Rateb RM; Maamoun A; Radwan N; Shubietah A; Manasrah A; Rajab I; Scichilone G; Tussing-Humphreys L; Mahmoud AM,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40647296/,0,1,0,1,0,0
40647217,Non-Pharmacological Interventions Aimed at Changing the Gut Microbiota for Preventing the Progression of Diabetic Kidney Disease.,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) affects 20-50% of individuals with diabetes. The aim of this review was to identify interventions that positively influence the gut microbiota in DKD. Identification of relevant studies was conducted via a systematic search of databases and registers using the PRISMA guidelines. This review examined the relevant literature published up to 5 January 2025, using a systematic search in PubMed and Scopus. The search was conducted with combinations of keywords including DKD and therapy, supplementation and gut microbiota, and supplementation or probiotics or fecal microbiota transplant. The initial search fielded 132 results from PubMed and 72 from Scopus, which was narrowed to 135 relevant studies. The exclusion criteria included non-English language studies, letters to the editor, and conference abstracts. Eligible studies were independently assessed by a minimum of three authors, with discrepancies resolved through consensus. Gut microbiota-targeted interventions, including probiotics, synbiotics, and dietary modifications, show promise in modulating the gut microbiota, but evidence specific to DKD remains limited. Some natural food components such as polyphenols and anthocyanins modulate the composition of the gut microbiota translocation of uremic toxins, which slows down the progression of diabetic kidney disease. In animal models, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has shown positive effects in regulating dysbiosis and beneficial effects in chronic kidney disease, but studies involving humans with DKD are insufficient. <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> strains, administered at doses ranging from 0.6 to 90 billion CFU, may help lower urea and creatinine levels, but outcomes vary by disease stage, duration of therapy, and amount used. High-fiber diets (>10.1 g/1000 kcal/day) and supplements such as resistant starch and curcumin (400-1500 mg/day) may reduce uremic toxins through gut microbiota modulation and reduction in oxidative stress. The effect of sodium butyrate requires further human studies.",Szczuko M; Grudniewska A; Durma A; Małecki R; Filipczyńska I; Franek E; Kędzierska-Kapuza K,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40647217/,0,1,0,0,0,0
40644772,The beneficial effects of sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) products and their bioactive compounds on cardiovascular disease risk factors in patients with diabetes: A GRADE-Assessed systematic review and meta-analysis.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of sesame supplementation on glycemic control, lipid profile, anthropometric measures, liver enzymes, inflammatory biomarkers, blood pressure, and oxidative stress parameters in patients with diabetes. A systematic search was conducted in Scopus, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library up to August 2024. Eligible studies evaluated the effects of sesame supplementation on cardiovascular disease risk factors (CVDs). Weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. Study quality and evidence strength were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, respectively. Thirteen studies, including 731 participants with intervention durations ranging from 6 to 12 weeks, were analyzed. Sesame supplementation significantly reduced fasting glucose (WMD = -28.48; 95 % CI: 37.66, -19.30; P < 0.001), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (WMD = -0.98; 95 % CI: 1.95, -0.02; P = 0.045), postprandial blood glucose (WMD = -15.90; 95 % CI: 21.59, -10.20; P < 0.001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (WMD = -29.72; 95 % CI: 47.88, -11.55; P = 0.001), total cholesterol (TC) (WMD = -32.76; 95 % CI: 52.69, -12.84; P = 0.001), triglycerides (TG) (WMD = -33.46; 95 % CI: 51.55, -15.37; P < 0.001), and significantly increased catalase (CAT) (WMD = 3.41; 95 % CI: 2.86, 3.96; P < 0.001), and superoxide dismutase activity (SOD) (WMD = 2.76; 95 % CI: 2.30, 3.22; P < 0.001).

40641714,"Effect of Magnesium Supplements on Improving Glucose Control, Blood Pressure and Lipid Profile in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: <i>A systematic review and meta-analysis</i>.","This study evaluated the effects of magnesium (Mg) supplementation on glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus through a meta-analysis of 23 randomised controlled trials involving 1,345 participants. Mg supplementation significantly increased serum Mg levels (weighted mean difference [WMD] = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.32 to 1.06) and reduced fasting blood glucose levels (WMD = -0.58, 95% CI: -0.87 to -0.28). However, the impact on glycated haemoglobin was minimal (WMD = -0.16, 95% CI: -0.32 to 0.00).

40638822,The impact of whey protein on plasma branched-chain amino acids and glycaemic control in humans. A narrative review.,"Impaired glycaemic control is a major risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes (T2D), a worldwide health epidemic intrinsically linked to diet and obesity. Whey proteins (WP) are increasingly popular supplements that are a rich source of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), essential for muscle protein synthesis and metabolic regulation. In humans, fasting plasma concentrations of BCAA are maintained around 350 µM but become chronically elevated by 10-25% in persons with T2D. Little is known about whether BCAA from WP impacts circulating BCAA concentrations and contributes to this phenomenon. This narrative review used a systematic search approach with relevant keywords to identify evidence from randomised controlled trials in normoglycaemic humans and those with insulin resistance or T2D, on the effects of WP intake on plasma BCAA and glycaemic control. This review is, to the authors' knowledge, the first to specifically examine the effects of WP intake on plasma BCAA concentrations in relation to glycaemic control. Whilst the majority of acute studies identified (<i>n</i> = 6) reported that WP consumption between 10 and 50 g significantly elevates postprandial BCAA and insulin responses (as evidenced by peak concentration and/or area under the curve), evidence from chronic studies (<i>n</i> = 3) report inconsistent findings on the impact of 9-51 g of WP/d on fasting BCAA and glycaemic control (for example, fasting glucose and insulin, insulin clearance). Findings from this literature review highlight the need for further studies that investigate the relationship between WP consumption with BCAA and glycaemic control, and to determine underlying mechanisms of action.",Bell HL; Jackson KG; Crompton LA; Givens DI; Lovegrove JA,Nutrition research reviews,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40638822/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40629913,Effectiveness of dietary interventions in individuals with diabetes for preventing and healing chronic wounds; a systematic review with meta-analysis.,"Optimising the nutritional status of individuals with diabetes is essential to optimise glycaemic control, as well as to prevent and promote wound healing. A variety of nutrition interventions are available. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to describe and synthesise the effectiveness of nutrition interventions for the prevention and management of chronic wounds in people with diabetes. Five databases and four clinical trial registries were searched for nutrition intervention studies. Included studies involved a nutrition intervention, such as personalised medical nutrition therapy, education and/or nutrient supplementation for those with diabetes and a chronic wound. Meta-analysis was completed utilising mean wound size at follow-up and non-adjusted data where available. Quality was appraised using RoB 2 and ROBINS, and certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE. Twenty-three studies were included; all included studies were in diabetes-related foot ulcer populations. Meta-analyses demonstrated nutrient supplements, including single and multi-nutrient supplements, significantly reduced wound depth (MWD -0.200 [95% CI -0.364, -0.035], p = 0.0172), width (WMD -0.466 [95% CI -0.724, -0.208], p = 0.0004) and length (-0.443 [95% CI -0.841, -0.045], p = 0.0292), the quality of included studies was low and the certainty of evidence was very low. While substantial heterogeneity was detected (I<sup>2</sup> = 56%-68%), a random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to account for between-study variability, providing an overall estimate while acknowledging differences in study characteristics. Two studies evaluating the effect of nutrition education demonstrated significant wound size reduction (n = 1) and proportion of people healed (n = 1). There is low-quality evidence that nutrient supplementation improves wound healing. Nutrition education may have a role in enhancing wound size reduction. Further studies are needed using robust methodologies to comprehensively determine the effectiveness of nutrition interventions for wound healing.",Donnelly HR; Collins CE; Clarke ED; Morrissey PI; Gilbertson-Viljevac N; Leigh L; Tehan PE,Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40629913/,0,1,0,1,0,1
40618386,Diet in Pregnancy: A Review of Current Challenges and Recommendations. A British Nutrition Foundation Briefing Paper.,"Pregnancy is a crucial period during which maternal nutrition, weight and lifestyle behaviours have a direct impact on both maternal and fetal health. This briefing paper describes dietary and lifestyle recommendations for women during the preconceptional period and throughout pregnancy, identifying specific factors that can be modified to improve health outcomes for both mother and child. It considers key areas such as nutrient intakes, supplementation, food safety and weight management, and highlights how dietary choices can help reduce the risk of common pregnancy-related conditions. Despite widespread recognition of the importance of a healthy, balanced diet, many women in the UK fall short of recommended intakes for important nutrients, including iron, folate, iodine and vitamin D. These shortfalls are particularly evident among nutritionally vulnerable groups, such as teenagers, women from lower-income households and those experiencing food insecurity; such groups may face barriers to accessing healthy foods and adhering to supplementation guidance. An increasing interest in plant-based diets presents an opportunity to consider a range of dietary patterns that support both maternal health and environmental sustainability. However, such shifts must be carefully managed to ensure adequate intake of nutrients commonly found in animal products, such as vitamin B12, iron, iodine, calcium and long-chain fatty acids. Rates of overweight and obesity among women of childbearing age remain high, reflecting trends in the general population and contributing to growing concern about maternal obesity. Maintaining a healthy weight before and during pregnancy plays a key role in supporting maternal and fetal wellbeing. Both insufficient and excessive weight gain are associated with elevated risks of complications. Excessive weight gain during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of developing gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders such as pre-eclampsia, preterm birth and a greater likelihood of long-term obesity in both mother and child. Supporting women to achieve and maintain a healthy weight in the periconceptional period and throughout pregnancy is therefore a public health priority. The antenatal period presents a unique window of opportunity to promote healthier and more sustainable eating patterns, as women are often highly motivated to improve their health and are in more regular contact with healthcare professionals at this time. Yet, research indicates that many women are unaware of dietary recommendations or receive inconsistent advice. To fully harness this opportunity, healthcare providers must be equipped with culturally appropriate, accessible and evidence-based resources to support perinatal conversations around diet, supplementation, physical activity and body weight. Providing appropriate support during the periconceptional and early pregnancy period is essential to addressing health inequalities, improving long-term wellbeing and positively influencing the health of future generations.",Hart KH; Hill AJ; Gonzalez JT; de la Hunty A; Gallagher AM; Stanner SA,Nutrition bulletin,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40618386/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40616487,Effects of Oral Vitamin D Supplementation on Vitamin D Levels and Glycemic Parameters in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.,"Epidemiological studies have shown that vitamin D status affects glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, findings from intervention studies remain inconsistent. Therefore, a network meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the comparative efficacy of various vitamin D supplementation strategies on glucose indicators in adults with T2DM. Eligible studies published before September 12, 2024, were retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. A network meta-analysis of multiple dosage strategies-low (< 1,000 IU/day, LDS), medium (1,000-2,000 IU/day, MDS), high (2,000-4,000 IU/day, HDS), and extremely high (≥ 4,000 IU/day, EHDS)-was performed. The network meta-analysis of 40 RCTs indicated that, compared with placebo, vitamin D <sub>3</sub> supplementation increased 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25-(OH)-D] levels, with pooled mean difference ( <i>MD</i>) showing a stepwise increase from LDS to EHDS. Ranking probabilities showed a corresponding rise in 25-(OH)-D levels from LDS (46.7%) to EHDS (91.2%). EHDS reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG) relative to no treatment. LDS significantly decreased hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and vitamin D <sub>2</sub> significantly affected FBG levels. MDS led to a significant change in fasting insulin (FIN) compared to both placebo ( <i>MD</i>: -4.76; 95% <i>CI</i> -8.91 to -0.61) and no treatment ( <i>MD</i>: -7.30; 95% <i>CI</i> -14.44 to -0.17). The findings suggest that vitamin D supplementation may be a viable approach for improving glycemic control in adults with T2DM, with lower doses potentially offering benefit. The analysis also showed a dose-dependent increase in 25-(OH)-D levels.",Zhang XJ; Wang HF; Gao X; Zhao Y,Biomedical and environmental sciences : BES,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40616487/,0,1,0,0,0,0
40613623,Exploring nutraceutical solutions for prediabetes: a narrative review on the effects of banaba and chromium picolinate.,"Prediabetes is an intermediary metabolic state marked by impaired glucose control, often preceding the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Early detection of prediabetes and intervention are critical to prevent the progression to T2D and its associated complications. This review examines the effects of nutraceuticals on regulating metabolism, with a focus on glucose control, specifically chromium picolinate (CrP) and banaba leaf extract. CrP has been extensively studied, and its role in regulating metabolism has been officially recognized. Preclinical research demonstrates its ability to improve glucose control by enhancing insulin sensitivity. These effects explain the reductions in fasting plasma glucose, elevated hemoglobin A1c, and insulin levels observed in clinical studies, particularly in patients with T2D. Banaba (Lagerstroemia speciosa) leaf extract, rich in corosolic acid and ellagitannins, has also shown promising results in improving glycemic control. As observed in preclinical studies, both banaba extract and corosolic acid exert insulin-sensitizing, glucose-lowering, and lipid-lowering properties. Clinical trials have confirmed these effects in individuals with T2D and prediabetes. Based on this evidence, combining CrP and banaba leaf extract may offer synergistic benefits in managing dysglycemia and delaying the onset of T2D in individuals with prediabetes. Only one study has evaluated the effects of the CrP and banaba extract combination, showing positive outcomes in individuals with prediabetes. Further research is needed to corroborate these preliminary findings. In conclusion, nutraceuticals like CrP and banaba leaf extract hold promise as complementary therapies to be used alongside lifestyle modifications for individuals with prediabetes. https://www.europeanreview.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/Graphical-Abstract-1-1-scaled.jpg.",Derosa G; Maffioli P; D'Angelo A; Foscaldi V; Piazza R; Mangrella M; Fogacci F; Cicero AFG,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40613623/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40600905,Contribution of dietary methionine to gut health and its related diseases: implications for precision nutrition.,"Gut health is intricately linked to energy homeostasis, stress resistance, inflammation, and longevity. Methionine (Met) intake significantly influences gut health, with both supplementation and restriction showing distinct effects. While appropriate Met supplementation offers benefits, excessive intake can be harmful, whereas Met restriction appears to improve overall health of the body, especially the gut. This review synthesizes research on Met's role in gut health, highlighting its metabolism, interactions with the intestinal microbiota, and effects on oxidative stress, inflammation, and permeability in the intestine. The possible reason for Met intake influences the risk of metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive impairment, thus influencing lifespan was explored, which is potentially via gut health. In addition, strategies for achieving precision nutrition of Met, including dietary adjustments, production of Met-specific foods, bioengineering plant strains, and methioninase supplementation, were proposed. These insights aim to deepen the understanding of Met's effects on gut health and guide interventions for improving health outcomes.",Yang Y; Xie Y; Lu M; Xu Y; Zhao R,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40600905/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40583786,Cauliflower mushroom (<i>Sparassis</i>): a promising functional food with nutritional and medicinal properties.,"<i>Sparassis</i> spp., commonly known as the cauliflower mushroom, is widely appreciated and consumed across numerous countries. It has gained significant attention in recent years due to its unique morphological characteristics, rich nutritional value, and pharmacological effects. In spite of the high demand for cauliflower mushrooms and their increasing economic importance, their cultivation is limited. <i>Sparassis</i> mushrooms are rich in macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, and unsaturated fatty acids) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). Notably, <i>Sparassis</i> spp. exhibits exceptionally high <i>β</i>-glucan content (up to 43.6% dry weight), contributing to its potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and anti-tumor activities. Polysaccharides, phenolic compounds, terpenoids, and lectins derived from these mushrooms demonstrate therapeutic potential against chronic diseases such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and cancer through mechanisms involving immune activation, oxidative stress reduction, and gut microbiota modulation. This comprehensive review explores the taxonomy, artificial cultivation, nutritional value, medicinal properties, and nutraceutical applications of <i>Sparassis</i> spp., focusing on its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tumor properties. We also discuss the challenges and future directions in the research and utilization of this remarkable fungal genus. The findings highlight the potential of <i>Sparassis</i> as a promising source of bioactive compounds with significant implications for food science and nutraceutical applications.",Qiu Z; Zhang X; Ren S; Jiang B; Zhao J; Zhu M; Zhou D; Li Q; Zhang M; Li T; Shu L,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40583786/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40580309,Effects of resveratrol supplementation on renal function in adults: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis.,"The influence of resveratrol on renal function was previously examined; nevertheless, the findings are inconsistent. Therefore, this systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of resveratrol on renal function. A comprehensive search was performed in Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar up to March 1<sup>st</sup>, 2025. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effect of resveratrol supplementation on the urea, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), albumin, total protein, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and creatinine (Cr) were included. A total of 2299 participants from 31 studies were included. Meta-analysis of studies indicated that resveratrol supplementation in comparison to placebo had favorable effects on the values of BUN [weighted mean difference (WMD) =  - 1.20; 95% CI: - 1.89, - 0.51 mg/dL; I<sup>2</sup> = 84.6%; 95% CI: 77, 90%; Tau<sup>2</sup> = 1.41; P < 0.001]. Based on the subgroup analysis, significant improvement was seen in Cr and GFR in the subgroup of participants without diabetes. Additionally, resveratrol supplementation for more than 8 weeks or at doses higher than 500 mg/d significantly elevated GFR and total protein values, respectively. However, the circulating values of albumin and uric acid were not affected by resveratrol supplementation. Although dose-response analysis was conducted for dosage and duration of intervention, no significant results were found. Resveratrol supplementation might improve GFR, BUN, creatinine, and total protein concentrations in adults. However, it did not significantly affect the circulating values of albumin and uric acid.",Hajhashemy Z; Ziaei R; Bagherniya M; Sahebkar A,Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40580309/,0,1,0,1,0,0
40536121,"Interaction between dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, obesity and gut microbiota in preclinical models: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials.","Emerging research underscores the potential of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in weight reduction and modulation of the gut microbiota. The current review systematically examines the effects of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on body weight regulation and gut microbiota modulation in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity models. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024559835). Systematic searches were conducted from database inception to May 2025 on PubMed/Embase, Web of Science and selected reference lists. A total of 32 trials were included, with 25 studies employing a HFD along with dietary omega-3 PUFA supplementation and 7 studies with a HFD prior to dietary omega-3 PUFA supplementation. Omega-3 PUFA interventions consistently demonstrated attenuation of HFD-induced weight gain and adiposity, though body weight remained elevated compared to low-fat diet controls. Omega-3 PUFA supplementation also induced significant gut microbiota compositional changes. Specifically, omega-3 PUFAs effectively reduced the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio, reversing a hallmark feature of HFD-induced dysbiosis. Enrichment of beneficial taxa, such as Akkermansia muciniphila, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, was consistently observed, correlating with enhanced short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, improved gut barrier integrity and reduced systemic inflammation. Concurrently, omega-3 PUFAs suppressed pathogenic bacteria, such as Desulfovibrio and Lachnoclostridium, which are associated with endotoxaemia and metabolic dysfunction. These preclinical evidence suggest the potential of omega-3 PUFAs as a promising dietary intervention for obesity management through gut microbiota modulation. However, variability in outcomes across studies emphasizes the need for further investigation into the optimal duration, dosage and sources of omega-3 supplementation. Moreover, the synergistic effects of omega-3 PUFA supplements and lifestyle interventions, such as high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which further regulates microbial composition and improves metabolic outcomes, are also highly promising.",Cao B; Sun Y; Lam C; Chen Y; Dri CE; McIntyre RS,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40536121/,0,1,0,0,0,0
40507812,Current Knowledge of the Impact of Vitamin D in Coronary Artery Disease.,"Coronary artery disease and vitamin D deficiency are both widespread conditions with a high incidence worldwide. Coronary artery disease is a complex illness with variable manifestation and pathogenesis. It often involves the development of atherosclerosis, and it frequently has serious or even fatal consequences for the patient. Vitamin D receptor expression is found in many tissues throughout the body, which results in a broad effect of the vitamin. Studies have found correlations between vitamin D deficiency and the development of coronary artery disease as well as other cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension. This review will discuss randomized controlled trials conducted from 2020 forward, aiming to elucidate whether vitamin D supplements have the potential to be used as an add-on treatment for coronary artery disease. The randomized controlled trials all used vitamin D as intervention and tested a population suffering from coronary artery disease or the risk of developing it. Even though animal studies found evidence that vitamin D can regulate inflammation, lipid profile, foam cell formation, vessel reactivity, and blood pressure, which are all mediators in the development of atherosclerosis, the results from the randomized controlled trials were ambiguous. The general older population did not seem to benefit from the treatment, but different subgroups such as patients with type 2 diabetes and patients with more developed coronary artery disease exhibited some positive effects from the treatment. Furthermore, vitamin D showed cardioprotective effects following coronary artery bypass surgery, which make it a possible add-on treatment before invasive coronary intervention. The question in focus still needs further research and a more focused approach on subgroups that may benefit from treatment.",Jespersen FE; Grimm D; Krüger M; Wehland M,International journal of molecular sciences,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40507812/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40507022,Effect of Sodium Butyrate Supplementation on Type 2 Diabetes-Literature Review.,"<b>Background:</b> Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) represents a major global health burden, with prevalence rates escalating due to rapid urbanization, economic growth, and the obesity epidemic. Despite intensive research, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood, with emerging evidence suggesting multifactorial origins involving genetic, epigenetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors. <b>Methods:</b> This review synthesizes current epidemiological data on T2DM prevalence, risk factors, and demographic patterns from 1990 to 2017, and discusses projected trends through 2030. We examine the role of intestinal barrier dysfunction and gut microbiota dysbiosis in T2DM pathogenesis, highlighting key mechanistic insights. Furthermore, we analyze recent findings on the role of butyrate, a major short-chain fatty acid, in preserving gut integrity and its potential therapeutic effects on metabolic health. <b>Results:</b> Global T2DM prevalence has risen markedly across all age groups, with particularly high rates in Western Europe and Pacific Island nations. Disruption of the intestinal barrier (""leaky gut"") and gut microbiota alterations contribute significantly to systemic inflammation and insulin resistance, which are pivotal features in T2DM development. Butyrate plays a central role in maintaining epithelial barrier function, modulating immune responses, and regulating glucose metabolism. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that sodium butyrate supplementation improves gut integrity, reduces systemic endotoxemia, and ameliorates metabolic parameters. Emerging clinical evidence suggests benefits of sodium butyrate, particularly when combined with prebiotic fibers, in improving glycemic control and reducing inflammatory markers in T2DM patients. <b>Conclusions:</b> Gut barrier integrity and microbiota composition are critical factors in T2DM pathogenesis. Sodium butyrate shows promise as a complementary therapeutic agent in T2DM management, although further large-scale, long-term clinical trials are required to confirm its efficacy and safety. Targeting gut health may represent a novel strategy for the prevention and treatment of T2DM.",Krauze W; Busz N; Pikuła W; Maternowska M; Prowans P; Maciejewska-Markiewicz D,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40507022/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Phthalates are regularly detected in food and ecosystem environments at detectable levels. The purpose of this study was to review and summarize the effect of phthalates on insulin secretion from pancreatic ß-cell. Also, the toxicity of pancreatic ß-cell caused by phthalates and the mechanism of toxicity were discussed in detail. To evaluate the amount of insulin secretion, the cells are usually exposed to two different concentrations of glucose (high and low). In almost all phthalate concentrations at high glucose concentrations, it leads to a decrease in insulin secretion. Furthermore, the most important mechanism in the physiological changes of pancreatic ß-cell was assigned to oxidative stress. The relationship between insulin secretion and oxidative stress parameters with phthalate concentration was identified in all studies.

40464117,Comprehensive exploration of marine functional foods in modulation of metabolic syndromes: a 20-year review.,"Metabolic syndromes (MetS), a cluster of conditions threatening global health, are a central focus of medical research. Bioactive compounds from marine sources, including peptides, polysaccharides, and lipids, have shown promising biological activities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, lipid-lowering, anti-obesity, and insulin-sensitizing effects. These properties hold potential in combating dyslipidemia, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes. Present work seeks to review the advancements in research on marine functional foods for treating metabolic disorders over the last 20 years. It focuses on the diverse biological activities of marine-derived compounds, their proposed mechanisms in modulating MetS, and their potential industrial applications in nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, functional foods, and cosmeceuticals. As the prevalence of MetS increases, current treatments face challenges like side effects, limited efficacy, and high costs. Considering this, marine functional foods offer a promising alternative due to their rich bioactive compounds, which can target multiple pathways involved in MetS. Moreover, marine proteins, peptides, omega-3 fatty acids, chitosan, fucoidans, and phlorotannins improve glucose and lipid metabolism, enhance insulin sensitivity, and reduce fat absorption, offering anti-diabetic and anti-hyperlipidemic benefits.

A systematic review of systematic reviews.,"Shift work can result in sleepiness, increasing risks of accidents, absenteeism and illness. Systematic reviews have examined individually-directed non-pharmacological interventions (e.g., light therapy, napping) for shift workers, but the diversity of interventions, settings and review conclusions make it difficult to determine which interventions work. We conducted a systematic review of systematic reviews to appraise evidence for such interventions to improve sleep or reduce sleepiness in shift workers. Six databases were searched and screened with good reliability. Two reviewers independently extracted data from all identified reviews, and a narrative synthesis was conducted. Twenty-eight systematic reviews were included, containing 69 primary studies involving 4947 participants. Twenty-three reviews were critically low-quality. The most-investigated interventions were light therapy (n = 8 reviews) and napping (n = 7 reviews). High-quality reviews suggested inconclusive evidence for which interventions improved sleep quality, sleep quantity and subjective sleepiness in shift workers, although lower quality reviews indicated light therapy, napping, physical activity, dietary supplements, mobile health apps and mindfulness may be effective. We have identified several promising interventions to improve sleep or reduce sleepiness in shift workers, although none met high-quality thresholds.

40440445,Evaluating the role of bromelain in diabetes management: a systematic review of research evidence and mechanisms of action.,"The use of complementary and alternative medicine is becoming increasingly important in the prevention and management of complications related to diabetes. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across major databases (EMBASE, Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Cochrane Library) up to December 2024. The search focused on studies examining the effect of bromelain on glycemic control, lipid profiles, and related mediators in diabetes. Bromelain supplementation demonstrated positive effects on key metabolic markers. Bromelain may stimulate AMPK in muscle cells, enhancing glucose uptake and utilization, potentially lowering blood glucose levels, and benefiting individuals with diabetes. Although direct evidence of bromelain's impact on incretin levels is limited, its ability to modulate gastrointestinal function and improve nutrient absorption could indirectly influence incretin secretion. Moreover, Peptides or smaller amino acids resulting from bromelain's proteolytic activity enter the bloodstream and potentially enhance nutrient absorption, which plays an important role in evaluating the therapeutic potential of bromelain in diabetes management. Bromelain supplementation is effective in improving glycemic and lipid indices in diabetes. However, further research is needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms, including bromelain's potential interaction with the incretin system and its role in modulating insulin resistance through various pathways.",Mohammed JS; Ahmed AT; Singh M; Hanumanthayya M; Kazmi SW; Chahar M; Kareem Al-Hetty HRA; Hulail HM; Alasheqi MQ; Zwamel AH,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40440445/,0,1,0,0,0,0

Primary information included prevalence of CAM use, types of CAM used, reasons for CAM use, factors associated with CAM use, and disclosure to healthcare providers. Meta-analyses were performed to determine the pooled prevalence of CAM use and non-disclosure of CAM using a random effect model. Forty-one studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of CAM use was 43% (95% confidence interval: 34%, 51%), I<sup>2</sup> = 99.46%. The reasons for CAM use included treatment of underlying comorbidities, complications or symptoms, maintenance of general health, and treatment of CKD. Nutritional approaches were the most common CAM modality, with 412 different herbal and dietary supplements reported; psychological and physical approaches included massage therapy, relaxation techniques, and mind-body practices; and other complementary health approaches such as homeopathy, traditional Chinese medicine, and Ayurvedic medicine were also frequently reported. Factors associated with CAM use included sociodemographic characteristics such as older age, female gender, or higher income; disease or therapy factors such as not having diabetes, relying on hemodialysis, or poor adherence to medication; and patient or internal factors such as positive attitude towards CAM and perceived safety of CAM. About 66% (61%, 72%) of CAM users did not disclose the use of CAM to their healthcare providers. CAM use is prevalent among individuals with CKD, and healthcare providers should communicate openly and effectively to emphasize the rational use of CAM to avoid potential harm.

40434673,Exploring the efficacy of plant-based nutraceuticals in managing diabetic neuropathy.,"Diabetes-induced peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common complications in patients with diabetes. Plant-derived natural products have been tested in animal models as agents to treat this complex condition. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the therapeutic potential of plant-based nutraceuticals used for managing diabetic neuropathy in rat models using a systematic literature review approach. The literature review was performed in November 2023 on two databases, PubMed and Scopus. Nerve conduction velocity and pain-related behaviors were considered primary outcome measures. For meta-analysis, a random effect model was selected with a mean difference at 95% confidence intervals to estimate the effect of plant-based nutraceuticals on the primary outcome measures. Eighteen studies were included in the meta-analysis, with results indicating that plant extracts or isolated compounds significantly increased nerve conduction velocity and thermal and mechanical paw withdrawal latencies. Different mechanisms of action to reduce neuropathy symptoms have been proposed in these studies including a reduction in inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers. This study suggests that plant-based therapies are effective in the management of diabetes-induced peripheral neuropathy. However, more studies are required with a standard experimental design and reporting.",Khan S; Markoulli M; Tsoi AT; Willcox M,Inflammopharmacology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40434673/,0,1,0,1,0,0
40431398,Nutraceutical Strategies for Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD): A Path to Liver Health.,"MASLD (Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease) is a growing global concern. Nutraceuticals offer an appealing approach by targeting key mechanisms, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, lipid metabolism, and insulin resistance. This narrative review examines the role of various nutraceuticals in MASLD treatment, including silymarin, vitamin E, omega-3, curcumin, berberine, and coenzyme Q10. Some of them show promising biochemical and metabolic changes, while others produce conflicting results due to relevant studies' design and endpoints. To bridge the gap between research and reality, we summarize the data, create an interpretation heatmap, and develop a practical supplement guide. Regardless of their potential, nutraceuticals should be viewed as add-ons to lifestyle interventions rather than standalone treatments. Future research should focus on well-designed, long-term studies to prove efficacy, dosing, and combination strategies for personalized MASLD management.",Vrentzos E; Pavlidis G; Korakas E; Kountouri A; Pliouta L; Dimitriadis GD; Lambadiari V,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40431398/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40431370,The Role of Nutraceuticals and Probiotics in Addition to Lifestyle Intervention in the Management of Childhood Obesity-Part 1: Metabolic Changes.,"Childhood obesity is a growing global health issue. Its rising prevalence is linked to genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Obesity in children could lead to different comorbidities and complications with an increased risk of metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). First-line treatment involves dietary modifications and lifestyle changes; however, adherence is often poor and remains a significant challenge. Pharmacotherapy, while a potential option, has limitations in availability and can cause side effects, leading to growing interest in alternative treatments, such as nutraceutical compounds. Derived from natural sources, these compounds have different anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, neuroprotective, antiaging, antitumor, insulin-sensitizing, glucose, and lipid-lowering effects. This review describes commonly used nutraceutical compounds, such as omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, polyphenols (such as resveratrol and curcumin), berberine, white mulberry leaves and others, and pre- and probiotics in the management of obesity, evaluating the evidence on their mechanisms of action and efficacy in metabolic comorbidities. The evidence suggests that the integration of nutraceuticals into the diet may positively influence body mass index, glucose metabolism, lipid profiles, and gut microbiota composition and reduce inflammation in obese individuals. These effects may provide future practical guidance for clinical practice, contribute to metabolic health improvement, and potentially prevent obesity-related complications. In this first part, we discuss the effects of nutraceutical compounds on insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance, T2DM, dyslipidemia, and MASLD in addition to diet and lifestyle interventions.",Street ME; Casadei F; Di Bari ER; Ferraboschi F; Montani AG; Shulhai AM; Esposito S,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40431370/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40429738,Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Vitamin D.,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a multifactorial disease in which environmental factors and genetic predisposition interact to induce an autoimmune response against pancreatic β-cells. Vitamin D promotes immune tolerance through immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory functions. The aim of this study is to provide a narrative review about the association between vitamin D status in the pathogenesis of T1DM and the role of vitamin D supplementation in the prevention and treatment of T1DM. Although vitamin D deficiency is more prevalent in children/adolescents with new-onset T1DM than in healthy individuals, there does not appear to be an association between vitamin D status before diagnosis and the onset of T1DMD later in life. The results of vitamin D as adjuvant therapy have, at best, a positive short-term effect in newly diagnosed T1DM patients. Intervention studies have been conducted in the clinical phase of T1DM, but it would be desirable to do so in the early stages of the autoimmune process (pre-diabetes).",Durá-Travé T; Gallinas-Victoriano F,International journal of molecular sciences,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40429738/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40427557,Prebiotics and Probiotics Supplementation in Pigs as a Model for Human Gut Health and Disease.,"Animal models are an essential part of translational research for the purpose of improving human health. The pig is a potential human research model that can be used to assess the effects of dietary interventions, pathologies, and drugs on gut health and the microbiome, due to its anatomical and physiological similarity to humans. It is recognised that a healthy gut is closely linked to the prevention of several chronic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, gastrointestinal inflammation, as well as neurological and cardiovascular diseases. The use of prebiotics and probiotics plays an important role in maintaining a healthy digestive system, which is responsible for modulating all other body functions. The present review focuses on the applications of prebiotics and probiotics in the pig as an animal model in healthy and diseased conditions, in order to highlight the efficacy of these molecules in the perspective of human health outcomes. The data support the use of prebiotics to improve intestinal health in both healthy and diseased states. In addition, the use of human microbiota-associated (HMA) gnotobiotic pigs provided a good model to study the intestinal and systemic immune response and microbiota composition following probiotic supplementation after a vaccine or virus challenge.",Rossi R; Mainardi E,Biomolecules,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40427557/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40421417,"Ganodermataceae-current status, research, and development in Lower Mekong Basin.","The family Ganodermataceae encompasses several genera, including the widely studied <i>Ganoderma</i>, which is prominent in traditional medicine for its therapeutic properties. Species within this family, particularly <i>Ganoderma lucidum</i>, have been valued for centuries in regions such as China, Korea, and Japan for enhancing vitality, longevity, and overall health. However, the taxonomy of Ganodermataceae remains complex, with ongoing debates about species identification and classification. Members of this family are globally distributed, with the Lower Mekong Basin-comprising Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam-offering optimal conditions for their growth due to its warm, humid climate. In the Lower Mekong Basin, the species of Ganodermataceae are significant for their medicinal applications in treating conditions such as bronchitis, hepatitis, diabetes, and cancer. They also hold significant economic value, being used in products like teas, dietary supplements, and cosmetics. <i>Ganoderma lucidum</i> is particularly notable as a high-value market product in this region. Recent research has revealed a rich diversity of Ganodermataceae species in the region, highlighting their ecological roles, medicinal properties, and importance in plant pathology, particularly in addressing diseases in crops such as oil palm.

40362174,A Systematic Review of Thiamine Supplementation in Improving Diabetes and Its Related Cardiovascular Dysfunction.,"The significance of thiamine in human health is linked to its role in several pathways that control different disease processes. Significant improvements in cardiometabolic diseases, substantially impacted by thiamine imbalances, are observed with thiamine supplementation. Diabetic patients could see a reduction in cardiovascular (CV) risk due to thiamine's significant impact on glucose metabolism. Specifically, increased ventricular filling pressures and oxygen consumption, indicative of CV dysfunction, are caused by oxidative and inflammatory damage to blood vessels, diabetic nephropathy, and elevated lactic acid production. Despite promising pre-clinical results for thiamine, clinical trials have yielded conflicting and contradictory findings due to limitations like small sample sizes and insufficient follow-up. To provide a summary of clinical study results, this systematic review assessed the impact of thiamine supplementation on diabetes and its CV complications. The studies included in this systematic review were retrieved from PubMed and Medline databases, in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and following the Population Intervention Comparison Outcome (PICO) framework. Seven clinical studies were identified, which enlighten the association between thiamine supplementation, hyperglycemia, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although large-scale, multicenter studies with longer follow-up periods are needed, the association between thiamine and chronic metabolic dysfunction related to CV risk suggests its crucial role in preventing severe heart failure (HF).",Serra M; Mollace R; Ritorto G; Ussia S; Altomare C; Tavernese A; Preianò M; Palma E; Muscoli C; Mollace V; Macrì R,International journal of molecular sciences,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40362174/,0,1,0,0,0,1
40319213,Gut Microbiota and Exercise: Probiotics to Modify the Composition and Roles of the Gut Microbiota in the Context of 3P Medicine.,"Prolonged and intense physical activity can trigger stress response mechanisms across various physiological systems-including the cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and neuroendocrine systems-disrupting energy metabolism, immune function, redox balance, and hormonal regulation. Critically, when not accompanied by adequate recovery, such exertion may impair rather than enhance athletic performance. In parallel, there has been growing interest in probiotics as natural, safe, and accessible dietary supplements with the potential to support performance and recovery. Emerging evidence highlights the pivotal role of the gut microbiome in mediating communication along the gut-brain and gut-muscle axes, thereby influencing not only metabolic and immune functions but also neuromuscular adaptation and fatigue resistance. This review explores the mechanisms through which probiotics may enhance exercise performance, mitigate exercise-induced fatigue, and improve physiological adaptation via modulation of inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic signaling pathways. Framed within the context of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (3P medicine), this paper emphasizes the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of personalized probiotic strategies in optimizing athletic performance through the qualitative and quantitative assessment of microbiota and host responses.",Liu Y; Hu Y; Ma B; Wang Z; Wei B,Microbial ecology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40319213/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40315282,New Insights into Folate-Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> Interactions.,"Folate and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (B12) are essential cofactors in folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism (FOCM). FOCM includes a series of methyl transfer reactions for methionine regeneration and de novo synthesis of nucleotides, including thymidylate. Deficiency in either folate or B12 can result in negative health outcomes including megaloblastic anemia, with additional neurocognitive impairments observed as a result of B12 deficiency. While folate deficiency is not common in the United States due to mandatory folic acid fortification, B12 deficiency is observed more frequently, particularly in certain subpopulations such as vegetarians/vegans and older adults. Fortification of the food supply with folic acid has been effective to increase folate status and reduce the incidence of birth defects. However, consumption of fortified foods and use of dietary supplements containing folic acid have led to an increase in the proportion of individuals exceeding the tolerable upper intake level of folic acid. Although the interaction between folate and B12 has been appreciated for decades in relation to megaloblastic anemia, it has been recently proposed that elevated serum folate may worsen neurocognitive effects and other metabolic impairments (altered glucose homeostasis, type 2 diabetes in offspring) associated with B12 deficiency. This review highlights molecular mechanisms that may explain the biology underlying these associations with a focus on findings from studies in model systems.",Castillo LF; Pelletier CM; Heyden KE; Field MS,Annual review of nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40315282/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40300556,Glucosamine supplementation contributes to reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes: Evidence from Mendelian randomization combined with a meta-analysis.,"ObjectiveObservational studies on glucosamine supplementation and type 2 diabetes risk have shown inconsistent results, necessitating the use of Mendelian randomization to clarify the true causal relationship.MethodsThe glucosamine supplementation-related genome-wide association study dataset was obtained from the MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit consortium, whereas type 2 diabetes-related genome-wide association study datasets were obtained from the FinnGen consortium (discovery) and Xue et al.'s meta-analysis (validation). Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses were performed separately in the discovery and validation datasets, followed by meta-analysis and multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses to verify the robustness of the results of two-sample Mendelian randomization. The estimation of the causal relationship was conducted through the inverse variance weighted method.ResultsGlucosamine supplementation exhibited a significant protective effect against type 2 diabetes, as identified by two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis in the FinnGen consortium (odds ratio: 0.13, 95% confidence interval: 0.02-0.89) and validated in Xue et al.'s meta-analysis (odds ratio: 0.06, 95%; confidence interval: 0.01-0.29). A combined meta-analysis (odds ratio: 0.08, 95%; confidence interval: 0.02-0.27) of the results of two-sample Mendelian randomization confirmed the robustness of these findings. Additionally, multivariable Mendelian randomization analysis (odds ratio: 0.12, 95%; confidence interval: 0.02-0.94), after adjusting for confounding factors, supported the results of two-sample Mendelian randomization. No evidence of heterogeneity or pleiotropy was observed.ConclusionOverall, our results revealed that genetically predicted glucosamine supplementation was inversely associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes, highlighting the potential importance of glucosamine supplementation in preventing type 2 diabetes.",Zhou S; Zhou P; Yang T; Si J; An W; Jiang Y,The Journal of international medical research,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40300556/,0,0,0,1,0,0
40299382,Linkage of Clinical Trial Data to Routinely Collected Data Sources: A Scoping Review.,"Patients who participate in clinical trials generate valuable routinely collected data (eg, medical records, electronic health records, claims databases, disease registries, or vital statistics) through their routine interactions with the health care system before, during, and after the trial. When this routinely collected data is linked at the participant level, it can supplement active data collection in the trial and provide deeper insights into the benefits, risks, and costs of treatments. To review clinical trials linked to routinely collected data in various countries, identifying the use cases and designs of these linkage studies. Research articles that reported the linkage of clinical trials to medical records, electronic health records, claims databases, disease registries, or vital statistics in their title or abstract were searched for in PubMed and MEDLINE. The search covered the period from January 1, 2016, through December 30, 2023. Opinion pieces, study protocols, or studies that involved interventions other than medications, dietary supplements, vaccines, devices, procedures, or diagnostics (eg, behavioral interventions) were excluded. Study eligibility and data extraction were performed independently by 2 reviewers to ensure the accuracy of findings. Of the 990 abstracts initially screened, a full text review was conducted for 147 articles. In total, 71 studies were included in the results, including 42 medication, vaccine, and dietary supplement trials (59.2%) and 29 device, procedure, or diagnostic trials (40.8%). Of these 71 studies, 24 (32.4%) were conducted in the US. In 32 studies (45.1%), consent for linkage was obtained prospectively as part of the main trial, while 33 studies (46.5%) received a waiver of authorization from the respective ethical review boards. The most frequent use cases of linkage to were posttrial long-term follow-up (22 studies [31.0%]), capturing primary or secondary outcomes of trials (19 studies [26.8%]), validation of routinely collected data outcomes (17 studies [23.9%]), and measuring health care resource utilization and cost in trials (12 studies [16.9%]). This study found that the linkage of patients' clinical trial data to routinely collected data has been implemented in several trials for various use cases and that most studies obtained consent for linkage prospectively as part of the main trial or received a waiver of authorization from ethical review boards.

40298870,Synthetic and Natural Agents Targeting Advanced Glycation End-Products for Skin Anti-Aging: A Comprehensive Review of Experimental and Clinical Studies.,"Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) cause blood vessel damage and induce diabetic complications in various organs, such as the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and skin. As glycation stress causes aesthetic, physical, and functional changes in the skin, glycation-targeting skin anti-aging strategies are attracting attention in cosmetology and dermatology. The primary goal of this review is to understand the significance of glycation-induced skin aging and to examine the therapeutic potential of glycation-targeting strategies. This study covers experimental and clinical studies exploring various interventions to attenuate glycation-induced skin aging. Glycation stress decreases the viability of cells in culture media, the cell-mediated contraction of collagen lattices in reconstructed skin models, and the expression of fibrillin-1 at the dermo-epidermal junction in the skin explants. It also increases cross-links in tail tendon collagen in animals, prolonging its breakdown time. However, these changes are attenuated by several synthetic and natural agents. Animal and clinical studies have shown that dietary or topical administration of agents with antiglycation or antioxidant activity can attenuate changes in AGE levels (measured by skin autofluorescence) and skin aging parameters (e.g., skin color, wrinkles, elasticity, hydration, dermal density) induced by chronological aging, diabetes, high-carbohydrate diets, ultraviolet radiation, or oxidative stress. Therefore, the accumulating experimental and clinical evidence supports that dietary supplements or topical formulations containing one or more synthetic and natural antiglycation agents may help mitigate skin aging induced by AGEs.",Choi JY; Ha NG; Lee WJ; Boo YC,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40298870/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40284190,"Homocysteine, Nutrition, and Gut Microbiota: A Comprehensive Review of Current Evidence and Insights.","Homocysteine, a sulfur-containing amino acid, is an intermediate product during the metabolism of methionine, a vital amino acid. An elevated concentration of homocysteine in the plasma, named hyperhomocysteinemia, has been significantly related to the onset of several diseases, including diabetes, multiple sclerosis, osteoporosis, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. An interaction between metabolic pathways of homocysteine and gut microbiota has been reported, and specific microbial signatures have been found in individuals experiencing hyperhomocysteinemia. Furthermore, some evidence suggests that gut microbial modulation may exert an influence on homocysteine levels and related disease progression. Conventional approaches for managing hyperhomocysteinemia typically involve dietary interventions alongside the administration of supplements such as B vitamins and betaine. The present review aims to synthesize recent advancements in understanding interventions targeted at mitigating hyperhomocysteinemia, with a particular emphasis on the role of gut microbiota in these strategies. The emerging therapeutic potential of gut microbiota has been reported for several diseases.

40278958,Melatonin supplementation: new insights into health and disease.,"Melatonin supplementation has gained considerable attention for its potential health impacts. This study aimed to review the recent literature on melatonin supplementation and its implications in areas such as obesity, diabetes, gut microbiome, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, sports performance, sleep quality, psychiatric disorders, pediatrics, pregnancy, and respiratory health. Additionally, assess the supplementation protocols, potential adverse effects, associated risks, and symptoms observed during supplementation. An extensive search was conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed, Scielo, Web of Science, CrossRef, and Google Scholar, focusing on publications from 2011 to 2024. A total of 71 articles were collected and analyzed. Recent studies highlight melatonin's promising antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties, particularly in improving sleep quality and addressing specific neurodegenerative diseases. Evidence supports its role in reducing anxiety in preoperative contexts and enhancing recovery under certain conditions in athletes. However, findings on melatonin's role in obesity, glycemic control, and gut microbiome regulation remain inconsistent and influenced by external factors such as diet and exercise. Similarly, evidence supporting its efficacy in cancer, psychiatric disorders, pregnancy, and pediatrics is limited and requires further research. For respiratory health, while melatonin's theoretical benefits include reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, current evidence is weak and largely preclinical. Concerns regarding adverse effects, including nightmares and grogginess, highlight the importance of thorough and careful monitoring. To ensure safety and effectiveness, supplementation protocols should be tailored to meet the unique needs of each individual. Melatonin supplementation is not a universal solution but a potentially valuable tool in specific contexts. Its benefits are most evident in sleep regulation and certain neurodegenerative conditions. However, significant gaps in research, including inconsistent methodologies, small sample sizes, and limited data on long-term effects, necessitate further robust clinical trials. Individualized recommendations and cautious interpretation of findings are essential, particularly given the variability in outcomes based on study designs and populations.",Minari TP; Pisani LP,Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40278958/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Supplementation with vitamins has garnered interest in recent years due to its association with the development of islet autoimmunity (IA) and T1DM. This systematic review aims to investigate the relationship between vitamins supplementation on the development of IA or T1DM or progression of IA to T1DM. This PRISMA-adherent systematic review involved a systematic search of PubMed, Embase and Cochrane for all studies that evaluated the odds (pre-calculated pooled OR) and risk (RR) of IA, T1DM, or progression of IA to T1DM after supplementation with vitamins. Random effects meta-analyses were used for primary analysis. 15 studies were included. Meta-analyses observed that vitamin D did not modify the odds of developing T1DM (Pooled OR=0.55, 95%CI: 0.22-1.38) or IA (Pooled OR=0.91, 95%CI: 0.67-1.25). The relative risk of developing T1DM was almost significant (RR=0.66, 95%CI: 0.41-1.06), emphasizing the need to conduct further large-scale cohort studies. Systematic review revealed that vitamin B supplementation did not influence the risk of T1DM and progression of IA to T1DM. Additionally, there was an association between higher maternal education levels and higher levels of vitamin D supplementation in their offspring. In conclusion, we found no significant benefit with the use of various vitamins in modifying the risk of developing IA, T1DM or progression of IA to T1DM.

40243711,The Pivotal Role of Thiamine Supplementation in Counteracting Cardiometabolic Dysfunctions Associated with Thiamine Deficiency.,"The isolation, structural elucidation, and synthesis of pure thiamin were achieved in 1936, marking a milestone in vitamin research. As an organic compound soluble in water, thiamin is essential for carbohydrate metabolism in plants and animals, and in its active form-as part of the thiamin pyrophosphate coenzyme-performs these functions. Thereby, thiamin represents an essential vitamin to human health and is involved in several pathways that regulate several pathophysiological mechanisms. Cardiovascular disease is significantly impacted by thiamine imbalance and its supplementation offers substantial improvements to the associated conditions. In this comprehensive review, we aimed to examine the dual role of thiamine deficiency and accumulation, focusing on an analysis of the causes of thiamine deficiency. We detailed the effects of thiamine deficiency on metabolism and on cardiovascular risk and heart failure, explaining the molecular mechanisms involved in metabolic dysfunction, and highlighting the role of B1 vitamin supplementation in diabetes mellitus management and atherosclerosis development and progression. Indeed, B1 supplementation counteracts oxidative stress and inflammation, significantly ameliorating glycemic and lipemic profiles. Additionally, we reported the beneficial effects of thiamine in counteracting cardiotoxicity induced by cancer therapy. Although preclinical data strongly support the benefits of thiamine, clinical trial findings are in contrast and contradictory, hampered by limitations such as small sample sizes and inadequate follow-up. Further research is needed to investigate thiamine's potential benefits, overcoming current study limitations and evaluating its use as a supplemental therapy alongside standard treatments in different high-cardiovascular-risk conditions.",Ritorto G; Ussia S; Mollace R; Serra M; Tavernese A; Palma E; Muscoli C; Mollace V; Macrì R,International journal of molecular sciences,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40243711/,1,0,0,0,0,1
40219624,"Nutrition, cognition and chronic kidney disease: A comprehensive review of interactions and interventions.","Cognitive impairment is a prevalent complication in chronic kidney disease (CKD), ranging from mild deficits in early stages to more severe conditions, such as mild cognitive impairment and dementia in advanced stages. CKD patients exhibit reduced performance in memory, attention, language, visuospatial abilities and executive functions. Contributing factors include uraemic toxins, structural brain changes, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, anaemia and comorbidities like diabetes mellitus. Malnutrition, affecting nearly half of CKD patients, exacerbates cognitive decline through inflammation, oxidative stress and protein-energy wasting. Nutritional deficiencies, particularly in protein, vitamin D, B vitamins, omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants, are linked to impaired cognition. Emerging evidence highlights the role of the gut-brain axis, with gut-derived uraemic toxins and microbiome alterations contributing to cognitive dysfunction. Processed foods and microplastics further compound risks by promoting inflammation and neurotoxicity. Dialysis and kidney transplantation offer opportunities for cognitive recovery, though challenges remain, particularly in haemodialysis patients. Nutritional interventions, including tailored protein intake, micronutrient supplementation and dietary counselling, are critical for mitigating cognitive decline. Addressing CKD comorbidities, such as anaemia and diabetes through targeted nutritional and pharmacological strategies, improves outcomes. Integrating psychological and social support enhances quality of life, given the high prevalence of anxiety and depression in CKD patients. Future research should focus on personalized nutrition, gut microbiota modulation and routine cognitive assessments to optimise care.

Controlling hyperglycemia is essential for avoiding and alleviating diabetic retinopathy. Nutrients and natural compounds possessing hypoglycemic characteristics present promising supplementary approaches to conventional therapies. This review assesses the influence of nutrients and natural substances on glycemic regulation and their possible effects on diabetic retinopathy. To investigate and consolidate knowledge about nutrients and natural compounds exhibiting hypoglycemic properties and their processes in the prevention and management of diabetic retinopathy. Extensive reviews were conducted on pertinent studies from databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Selection criteria encompassed papers that examined natural substances, nutrients, or dietary supplements exhibiting effects on blood glucose levels and pathways associated to diabetic retinopathy. Principal findings were encapsulated according to their mechanisms, efficacy, and safety. Numerous foods, including omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, and polyphenols (e.g., curcumin, resveratrol), have hypoglycemic properties by improving insulin sensitivity and diminishing oxidative stress. Natural substances like berberine, quercetin, and flavonoids demonstrate analogous effects, influencing pathways associated with inflammation, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and angiogenesis, which are critical factors in the evolution of diabetic retinopathy (DR). The synergistic benefits of integrating natural medicines with conventional antidiabetic medications may enhance glycemic control and reduce retinal damage. The safety profiles of these therapies are predominantly positive; nonetheless, clinical trials are still constrained in both breadth and scale. Nutrients and natural compounds are promising supplementary approaches for glycemic regulation and the therapy of diabetic retinopathy. Additional research, encompassing extensive clinical studies, is required to substantiate their efficacy, determine optimal dose, and verify long-term safety. The use of these natural substances into clinical practice may improve comprehensive management of diabetes and associated consequences.",Cappellani F; Foti R; Malaguarnera G; D'Esposito F; Musumeci C; Rapisarda L; Tognetto D; Gagliano C; Zeppieri M,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40218965/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40203784,Navigating nutrition through the decades: Tailoring dietary strategies to women's life stages.,"The female-specific hormones are responsible for the different metabolic changes occurring in the overall well-being of a woman. Especially highlighted phases are the onset of puberty, menarche, pregnancy, lactation, and menopause. They involve significant metabolic changes, which alter the nutritional requirements. Women, in general, are often unaware of these varied nutritional requirements and fail to inculcate them in their diet, influencing their health. Increased calories, protein, iron, and calcium consumption during adolescence is required for bone growth and the prevention of osteoporosis later in life. The availability through a balanced diet of zinc and essential vitamins such as D, K, and B12 is also critical for a rapidly growing body. At present, infertility is also a pressing issue for couples. Female fertility can be enhanced by a diet high in plant-based protein, dietary fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals. Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids can help to enhance the quality of eggs, and plant-based proteins reduce the incidence of infertility. Thereafter, during pregnancy, nutritional requirements increase, especially for vitamins B6, B12, and D, calcium, proteins, folate, zinc, and iron. A properly balanced diet can satisfy basic nutritional requirements. However, iron supplements are essential for supporting the blood supply to the placenta and fetus. During menopause and menopausal transition, symptoms are observed like vaginal dryness, hot flashes, and irregular menstruation, followed by an increased threat of cardiovascular diseases, tumors, type 2 diabetes, and osteoporosis. Sufficient intake of protein, calcium, vitamins B, C, and D, and omega-3 fatty acids is important in managing the symptoms. The strategic combination of antioxidant-rich foods with a low-fat, plant-based diet can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and regulate body mass. The conclusion of this review is that timely changes in nutrition and strategizing dietary supplements can ease the transition phases of the female lifecycle and improve quality of life.",Harak SS; Shelke SP; Mali DR; Thakkar AA,"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40203784/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40199888,Vitamin D supplementation vs. placebo and incident type 2 diabetes in an ancillary study of the randomized Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial.,"Observational and experimental evidence suggests that vitamin D plays a role in type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, prior randomized supplementation trials are limited to high-risk patients with prediabetes. Here we aim to evaluate whether vitamin D supplementation reduces risk of T2D in a general population of older US adults. The study design is an ancillary analysis (VITAL-T2D) of The Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL), a completed randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 2 × 2 trial of daily vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (cholecalciferol; 2000 IU/day) and omega-3 fatty acids (1 g/day) for the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease. We also conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of vitamin D trial (≥1000 IU/d cholecalciferol) vs. placebo and T2D risk. We analyzed 22,220 adults with mean age 67.2 years (SD = 7.1) without T2D at enrollment (2011 to 2014), randomized to vitamin D<sub>3</sub> or placebo. Mean body mass index (BMI) was 27.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (SD = 5.3), with 51% female and 17% Black race/ethnicity. A subcohort (n = 911) attended in-person visits at baseline and 2 years for glycemic trait analyses. Our meta-analysis included 3 additional trials (5205 participants; 936 T2D cases). The primary outcome for the VITAL-T2D is intention-to-treat effect of vitamin D vs. placebo for incident T2D. T2D incidence (cases/1000py) at median follow-up of 5.3 y was 3.98 for vitamin D and 4.37 for placebo (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.76, 1.09). Results did not differ by age, sex, BMI, or baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and vitamin D had no effect on glycemic traits at 2 years. Meta-analysis of 4 trials (n = 5205; 936 T2D cases) obtained HR = 0.89 (CI = 0.80, 0.99). In conclusion, Vitamin D supplementation did not reduce T2D in older US adults, but a modest reduction was observed when meta-analyzed with prior trials.

40187225,Probiotic supplementation contributes to glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic medical condition prevalent worldwide. Currently, probiotic therapy has demonstrated favorable outcomes in T2DM management, albeit with a lingering controversy. In this network meta-analysis (NMA), we aimed to assess and rank the glycemic control efficacy of various probiotic strains or combinations in T2DM patients. A systematic literature review was conducted across 4 major databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library) including data published up to November 8, 2023, to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on probiotic therapy in T2DM patients. The quality of the included RCTs was evaluated using the risk-of-bias tool version 2, while Bayesian NMA was used for analysis. The efficacy of different probiotics and their combinations was ranked based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) for various outcome indicators. This study included 1861 T2DM patients from 30 RCTs. The combination of LAC (Lactobacillus) + BIF (Bifidobacterium) + PRO (Propionibacterium) + STR (Streptococcus) exhibited the most favorable effect in reducing the fasting plasma glucose concentration and improving the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (SUCRA: 88.8% and 77.3%). For reducing the concentration of glycated hemoglobin A1c, BIF (SUCRA: 93.1%) was the most effective; for improving insulin secretion, LAC + BIF (SUCRA: 84.7%) exhibited the most favorable outcome for improving insulin secretion. Cluster analysis of the 4 outcome indicators showed that the LAC + BIF + STR combination may have superior therapeutic effects. Multistrain probiotic combinations demonstrated greater glycemic control effects than single-strain probiotics. Thus, LAC + BIF + STR may be a promising probiotic combination for the treatment of T2DM. Nevertheless, owing to the inherent limitations of existing studies, further research is warranted to ascertain the long-term efficacy of probiotics.",Ma D; Zhao P; Gao J; Suo H; Guo X; Han M; Zan X; Chen C; Lyu X; Wang H; Liu J,"Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40187225/,0,1,0,0,0,0
40142459,"Where Biology Meets Engineering: Scaling Up Microbial Nutraceuticals to Bridge Nutrition, Therapeutics, and Global Impact.","The global nutraceutical industry is experiencing a paradigm shift, driven by an increasing demand for functional foods and dietary supplements that address malnutrition and chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, and cancer. Traditional plant- and animal-derived nutraceuticals face limitations in scalability, cost, and environmental impact, paving the way for microbial biotechnology as a sustainable alternative. Microbial cells act as bio-factories, converting nutrients like glucose and amino acids into valuable nutraceutical products such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), peptides, and other bioactive compounds. By harnessing their natural metabolic capabilities, microorganisms efficiently synthesize these bioactive compounds, making microbial production a sustainable and effective approach for nutraceutical development. This review explores the transformative role of microbial platforms in the production of nutraceuticals, emphasizing advanced fermentation techniques, synthetic biology, and metabolic engineering. It addresses the challenges of optimizing microbial strains, ensuring product quality, and scaling production while navigating regulatory frameworks. Furthermore, the review highlights cutting-edge technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 for genome editing, adaptive evolution for strain enhancement, and bioreactor innovations to enhance yield and efficiency. With a focus on sustainability and precision, microbial production is positioned as a game-changer in the nutraceutical industry, offering eco-friendly and scalable solutions to meet global health needs.

40126033,Impact of flavan-3-ols on blood pressure and endothelial function in diverse populations: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Flavan-3-ols, found in cocoa, tea, and certain fruits, show promise in improving blood pressure (BP) and vascular function, but are currently not used for cardiovascular prevention. This meta-analysis evaluated the effects of flavan-3-ol-rich interventions on BP and endothelial function. PubMed was searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published 1946-03/2024 on BP and flow-mediated dilation after flavan-3-ol-rich food, beverage, or supplement intake. Random-effects meta-analysis of 109 publications including 145 RCTs and 5205 participants was performed (PROSPERO: CRD42023454691). Flavan-3-ol interventions included epicatechin, epigallocatechin-gallate, cocoa products, tea, grape extract, and apples delivering 586 mg (95% CI 510, 662) total flavan-3-ols. Interventions decreased office (-2.8 [95% CI -3.9, -1.7]/-2.0 [-2.6, -1.3] mmHg) and 24 h-ambulatory BP (-3.7 [-5.8, -1.6]/-2.6 [-4.5, -0.8] mmHg) after chronic repetitive consumption. Effects were larger with elevated and hypertensive baseline BP or categorical hypertension (office: -5.9 [-10.0, -1.8]/-2.7 [-4.4, -1.0] mmHg, 24 h ABP: -6.8 [-16.3, 2.8]/-5.1 [-12.5, 2.2] mmHg). Meta-regression analysis confirmed that the magnitude of BP lowering was inversely related to baseline BP, but not to proportion of participants with CVD, diabetes mellitus, and study duration across all studies, and was dose-dependently related to epicatechin dose only in cocoa studies. Flow-mediated dilation increased after acute (+2.0% [1.6, 2.3]) and repetitive (+1.7% [1.3, 2.2]) consumption independent of BP. Reported adverse events were minor and low (0.4%). The considerable heterogeneity of effect sizes (I2 > 50%) between studies was not explained by the investigated factors limiting the strength of evidence to 'moderate'. Flavan-3-ol-rich foods considerably reduce elevated BP and improve endothelial function independent of blood pressure supporting their use for cardiovascular prevention.",Lagou V; Greyling A; Ferruzzi MG; Skene SS; Dubost J; Demirkan A; Prokopenko I; Shlisky J; Rodriguez-Mateos A; Heiss C,European journal of preventive cardiology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40126033/,0,1,0,1,0,0
40124109,The Inflammation-Initiating and Resolving Mechanisms and Oxidation: Could Periodontal Therapy and Nutritional Strategy Improve the Systemic Health? A Narrative Review.,"Periodontitis (PDS) is one of the most common and crippling systemic diseases. It is a chronic inflammatory condition that leads to the loss of periodontal attachment, resulting in tooth loss. In addition to its effects on oral health and nutrition, PDS is closely linked to other systemic conditions such as diabetes mellitus (DM), cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The active role of inflammation and oxidation in systemic health, as well as their relationship with periodontal therapy, has been investigated. This review explores the evidence on how periodontal therapy and dietary lifestyle can help reduce chronic inflammation, limit oxidation, and prevent related pathologies. Nonsurgical periodontal therapy (NSPT) and nutrition have been extensively discussed as potential contributors to positive clinical outcomes by resolving inflammatory pathogenic pathways. NSPT, foods, and dietary supplements represent therapeutic strategies that address the underlying mechanisms of chronic inflammation and oxidation at various stages. A key finding from this review is that periodontal treatment, in conjunction with nutritional counseling, can improve clinical outcomes in PDS, DM, CVD, and RA. However, for NSPT, nutrition, and dietary composition to be effective, they should be integrated into a sustainable, long-term lifestyle.",Salvatori R; Generali L; Bellei E; Bergamini S; Bertoldi C,Food science & nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40124109/,1,0,0,0,0,0

40085334,Antioxidant Supplementation for Management of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus in Pregnancy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomised Controlled Trials.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the most common medical complication of pregnancy globally. Hyperglycaemia and associated production of reactive oxygen species can lead to oxidative stress in pregnancy. However, the potential effectiveness of increased antioxidant intake in the management of GDM has not been widely examined. Its usefulness alongside medical nutrition therapy (MNT) for assisting glycaemic control in women with GDM is poorly understood. This review aimed to establish the effect of antioxidant supplementation on the risk and management of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). A systematic review of intervention studies was conducted based on PRISMA guidelines. Databases searched were MEDLINE, CINAHL, Global Health, Scopus, Embase and Cochrane until September 2024. Random effects meta-analyses using Cochrane Review Manager software to establish the effect of antioxidant supplementation on glucose outcomes in women with GDM were conducted. A total of 13 studies (1380 participants) were included in the review with four different antioxidants used (selenium (n = 3); alpha-lipoic (n = 4); zinc (n = 5); e-3-gallate (n = 1)). Significant pre-post differences between antioxidant supplementation and control groups were found for fasting insulin (SMD, 95%CI) (-0.97 [-1.69 -0.24]; p = 0.009, HOMA-IR (-0.90 [-1.25, -0.54]; p < 0.0000, HOMA-B (-0.86 [-1.05, -0.67]; p < 0.00001 and QUICKI (1.09 [0.32,1.87]; p = 0.005 Heterogeneity was substantial (I<sup>2</sup> > 50%, p < 0.05) for all models except for HOMA-B (I<sup>2</sup> = 0%, p > 0.05).

Extensive scientific research has provided compelling evidence of the detrimental effects of vitamin D deficiency on the skeletal system. Furthermore, vitamin D supplementation not only helps prevent bone fractures but may also slow the progression of various conditions, such as diabetes, autoimmune disorders, and cardiovascular disease. Achieving optimal circulating vitamin D levels can be challenging, particularly in certain clinical scenarios. Moreover, the effect of vitamin D supplementation varies depending on factors such as body weight, pregnancy status, absorption capacity, metabolic rate, and renal function.

40077612,Preventing and Managing Pre- and Postoperative Micronutrient Deficiencies: A Vital Component of Long-Term Success in Bariatric Surgery.,"Bariatric surgery (BS) is an effective treatment for severe obesity and its related comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. However, the anatomical and physiological changes associated with these procedures significantly increase the risk of preoperative and postoperative micronutrient deficiencies, which can lead to severe complications such as anemia, osteoporosis, and neurological disorders. This narrative review examines the prevalence and clinical implications of micronutrient deficiencies in BS patients, as well as evidence-based strategies for their prevention and management. The most common deficiencies include iron, vitamin B12, folate, calcium, vitamin D, and fat-soluble vitamins (A, E, and K). Procedures with a hypoabsorptive component, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD/DS), pose higher risks of deficiencies compared to restrictive procedures like sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Effective strategies involve the preoperative correction of deficiencies, continuous monitoring, and tailored supplementation. However, long-term adherence to supplementation tends to decrease over time, influenced by behavioral and socioeconomic factors. Hence, preventing and managing micronutrient deficiencies are crucial for the long-term success of BS. While current guidelines provide valuable recommendations, many are based on low-certainty evidence, underscoring the need for more robust studies. A multidisciplinary approach, combined with innovative strategies, such as telemedicine, can enhance adherence and achieve sustainable clinical outcomes.",Reytor-González C; Frias-Toral E; Nuñez-Vásquez C; Parise-Vasco JM; Zambrano-Villacres R; Simancas-Racines D; Schiavo L,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40077612/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40059912,A Review of Dietary and Lifestyle Management of Pre-Eclampsia and Postpartum Eclampsia.,"Eclampsia is a prevailing hypertensive disorder that poses more significant risks to mothers and neonates globally. This review aimed to investigate eclampsia [preeclampsia and postpartum eclampsia (posteclampsia)] and the supportive role of dietary and lifestyle management. The review was compiled by searching various engines such as Google Scholar, Research Gate, BASE, PubMed Central, National Center for Biotechnology Information, and other related search engines. Eclampsia is believed to involve genetic and nongenetic factors, although the precise underlying mechanism remains unclear. Nevertheless, the traditional diagnosis of the disorder typically involves the coexistence of various factors such as an unhealthy lifestyle, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, low micronutrient levels, obesity, and proteinuria. Consuming at least 330 g fresh or 4 g dried fruits daily minimizes preeclampsia. Diets high in sugar, fat, and salt are associated with higher vulnerability to the disease. Calcium supplementation is beneficial for women as it helps to reduce the occurrence of preeclampsia. Evidence for vitamin D supplementation is inconclusive and requires further research. Selenium supplementation has shown a negative correlation with the chance of preeclampsia. Dietary patterns with higher intakes of a plant-based diet, including micronutrients, and a healthy lifestyle significantly reduce the risk of preeclampsia and posteclampsia. Furthermore, clinical trials could explore the potential benefits of dietary supplements in preventing or treating eclampsia. There is a need for further exploration into the benefits of personalized medical nutrition therapy for preeclampsia and posteclampsia. Lastly, modern prognostic tools can diagnose disorders promptly and help with effective medicinal and nutritional management.",Nadeem M; Javed K; Abid HMR; Hussain A; Khalid N,Preventive nutrition and food science,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40059912/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40057969,Maternal probiotic supplementation and effects on the fetal placenta.,"Increasing number of pregnant women are consumi ng probiotics to promote their own health and that of their unborn fetuses. Such supplements are presumed to be safe for pregnant mothers and their unborn offspring. For pregnant mothers, such bioactive compounds might lower the risk of constipation, diarrhea, other gastrointestinal conditions, and pre-term birth, and prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes, including gestational diabetes mellitus and depression/anxiety. More research is needed to examine potential safety of probiotic consumption during pregnancy and long-term health consequences to offspring. The conceptus can also be indirectly affected by maternal probiotic supplementation through microorganism production of bioactive compounds. The placenta is in direct communication with the underlying uterine tissue. Thus, compounds in the maternal blood can easily transfer across the placenta and impact this hormonally sensitive organ. Select studies suggest that disruptions to the maternal microbiome dramatically affect the placenta. In the current review, we will therefore consider the evidence to date of how maternal probiotic supplementation affects the placenta. Three potential mechanisms we will explore include the possibility that maternal probiotic supplementation might impact the putative placenta microbiome. The second potential mechanism we will consider is that maternal probiotic consumption alters bacterial-derived metabolites, including short-chained fatty acids, polyamines, Vitamin B9, and Vitamin B12. The third potential mechanism to be discussed is that such supplements affect maternal and placental immune responses. Before probiotics are promoted for healthy pregnant women and those with gestational disorders, more studies, including those examining the effects on the placenta, are essential.",Herrington RTB; Ellenberger DT; Rosenfeld CS,Biology of reproduction,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40057969/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40044446,An Umbrella Review of Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses of Randomized Controlled Trials Investigating the Effect of Curcumin Supplementation on Lipid Profiles.,"Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and curcumin may help improve lipid metabolism. This umbrella review and updated meta-analysis assessed the effects of curcumin supplementation on lipid profiles. Electronic databases (Medline, Scopus, Cochrane, and Google Scholar) were searched through March 31, 2023, without language restrictions. Two independent authors selected eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving curcumin supplementation compared with placebo, measuring total cholesterol (TC), low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and triglyceride (TG) levels. This study identified 26 systematic reviews and meta-analyses (MAs) that met the inclusion criteria for the umbrella review. Of these, 53 RCTs, with a corrected coverage area of 9.76% indicating a moderate degree of overlap, were included for re-pooling. Additionally, this study found 19 more RCTs, bringing the total number of studies for the updated MAs to 72. Curcumin significantly reduced TC, LDL-c, and TG, with mean differences (MDs) of -7.76 mg/dL (95% CI: -11.29, -4.22; I2 = 97%), -5.84 mg/dL (95% CI: -11.63, -0.05; I2 = 98%), and -13.15 mg/dL (95% CI: -17.31, -8.98; I2 = 94%), respectively, and increased HDL-c by 2.4 mg/dL (95% CI: 1.22, 3.57; I2 = 94%). The reductions in LDL-c and TG reached the minimally clinically important differences (MCIDs). However, the reduction in TC and increase in HDL-c did not meet their respective MCIDs. Subgroup analysis showed greater lipid improvements in patients with metabolic-related diseases, particularly type 2 diabetes. Enhanced bioavailability forms of curcumin, supplementation for at least 8 weeks, and exercise yielded additional benefits. The study confirmed that curcumin has an anti-lipidemic effect on patients with noncommunicable diseases. A form of curcumin with enhanced bioavailability is preferred, and supplementation for at least 8 weeks, along with exercise, may be used as an accessible approach to reduce the risk of ASCVD.

39997751,Therapeutic Strategies to Modulate Gut Microbial Health: Approaches for Chronic Metabolic Disorder Management.,"Numerous recent studies have suggested that the composition of the intestinal microbiota can trigger metabolic disorders, such as diabetes, prediabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, sarcopenia, dyslipidemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Since then, considerable effort has been made to understand the link between the composition of intestinal microbiota and metabolic disorders, as well as the role of probiotics in the modulation of the intestinal microbiota. The aim of this review was to summarize the reviews and individual articles on the state of the art regarding ideal therapy with probiotics and prebiotics in order to obtain the reversion of dysbiosis (alteration in microbiota) to eubiosis during metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, prediabetes, obesity, hyperhomocysteinemia, dyslipidemia, sarcopenia, and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases. This review includes 245 eligible studies. In conclusion, a condition of dysbiosis, or in general, alteration of the intestinal microbiota, could be implicated in the development of metabolic disorders through different mechanisms, mainly linked to the release of pro-inflammatory factors. Several studies have already demonstrated the potential of using probiotics and prebiotics in the treatment of this condition, detecting significant improvements in the specific symptoms of metabolic diseases. These findings reinforce the hypothesis that a condition of dysbiosis can lead to a generalized inflammatory picture with negative consequences on different organs and systems. Moreover, this review confirms that the beneficial effects of probiotics on metabolic diseases are promising, but more research is needed to determine the optimal probiotic strains, doses, and administration forms for specific metabolic conditions.",Rondanelli M; Borromeo S; Cavioni A; Gasparri C; Gattone I; Genovese E; Lazzarotti A; Minonne L; Moroni A; Patelli Z; Razza C; Sivieri C; Valentini EM; Barrile GC,Metabolites,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39997751/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Since then, six eligible RCTs have been completed, including one large trial (n=15 804). We aimed to re-examine the link between vitamin D supplementation and prevention of ARIs. Updated systematic review and meta-analysis of data from RCTs of vitamin D for ARI prevention using a random effects model. Subgroup analyses were done to determine whether effects of vitamin D on risk of ARI varied according to baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentration, dosing regimen, or age. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and the ClinicalTrials.gov between May 1, 2020 (end-date of search of our previous meta-analysis) and April 30, 2024. No language restrictions were imposed. Double-blind RCTs supplementing vitamin D for any duration, with placebo or lower-dose vitamin D control, were eligible if approved by a Research Ethics Committee and if ARI incidence was collected prospectively and pre-specified as an efficacy outcome. Aggregate data, stratified by baseline 25(OH)D concentration and age, were obtained from study authors. The study was registered with PROSPERO (no. CRD42024527191). We identified six new RCTs (19 337 participants). Data were obtained for 16 085 (83·2%) participants in three new RCTs and combined with data from 48 488 participants in 43 RCTs identified in our previous meta-analysis. For the primary comparison of any vitamin D versus placebo, the intervention did not statistically significantly affect overall ARI risk (OR 0·94 [95% CI 0·88-1·00], p=0·057; 40 studies; 61 589 participants; I<sup>2</sup>=26·4%). Pre-specified subgroup analysis did not reveal evidence of effect modification by age, baseline vitamin D status, dosing frequency, or dose size. Vitamin D did not influence the proportion of participants experiencing at least one serious adverse event (OR 0·96 [95% CI 0·90-1·04]; 38 studies; I<sup>2</sup>=0·0%). A funnel plot showed left-sided asymmetry (p=0·0020, Egger's test).

39986580,COVID-19 and our understanding of vitamin D and immune function.,"The interaction between vitamin D and the immune system is perhaps the most well recognised extraskeletal facet of vitamin D, encompassing early studies of therapy for TB and leprosy through to more recent links with autoimmune disease. However, the spotlight on vitamin D and immune function has been particularly intense in the last five years following the COVID-19 pandemic. This was due, in part, to the many association studies of vitamin D status and COVID-19 infection and disease prognosis, as well as the smaller number of clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation. However, a potential role for vitamin D in COVID-19 also stemmed from the basic biology of vitamin D that provides a plausible mechanistic rationale for beneficial effects of vitamin D for improved immune health in the setting of respiratory infection. The aim of this review is to summarise the different strands of mechanistic evidence supporting a beneficial effect of vitamin D in COVID-19, how this was modified during the pandemic itself, and the potential new aspects of vitamin D and immune function that are likely to arise in the near future. Key topics that feature in this review are: antibacterial versus antiviral innate immune responses to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D); the function of immune 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) activity and metabolism of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) beyond antigen-presenting cells; advances in immune cell target gene responses to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (notably changes in metabolic profile). Whilst much of the interest during the COVID-19 era has focused on vitamin D and public health, the continued evolution of our understanding of how vitamin D interacts with different components of the immune system continues to support a beneficial role for vitamin D in immune health.",Hewison M,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39986580/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39984625,Effects of oral supplementation of probiotics on body weight and visceral fat in obese patients: a meta-analysis and systematic review.,"Obesity can mediate the occurrence of many cardiovascular metabolic diseases, such as coronary heart disease and diabetes, which will lead to a significant increase in all-cause mortality in obese people. Visceral fat refers to the excessive accumulation of adipose tissue in abdominal organs, which can lead to impaired normal function of organs. In recent years, it has been reported that probiotics can reduce obesity and visceral fat content, and some studies have put forward the opposite conclusion. In order to guide the practice of nutrition, we use Meta-analysis method to analyze these conclusions. The authors searched randomized controlled trials on the effects of oral probiotics on body weight and visceral fat content in obese people published before January 2024 in several public databases, such as PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and CNKI. The primary outcome was body weight, and the secondary outcomes included BMI, waist circumference, visceral fat content, and low-density lipoprotein levels. This trial has been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024521353). A total of 8 randomized controlled trials involving 412 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed that the weight loss of the experimental group taking probiotics was significantly higher than that of the control group (P < 0.00001). The reduction of waist circumference in the experimental group taking probiotics was significantly different from that in the control group (P = 0.01). The decrease of visceral fat content in the experimental group taking probiotics was significantly different from that in the control group (P < 0.00001). There was no significant difference in BMI and LDL-C levels between the experimental group and the control group. Oral probiotics can reduce weight loss, waist circumference and visceral fat content in obese patients, which may be a potential nutritional treatment for obese patients in the future. However, whether oral probiotics can reduce BMI and LDL-C levels in obese patients needs to be included in more RCTs and further discussed in the future.",Guo M; Li J; Zhang L; Chen C; Wei Y; Shen ZA,Scientific reports,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39984625/,0,1,0,1,0,0
39940284,Protective Effects of Sulforaphane Preventing Inflammation and Oxidative Stress to Enhance Metabolic Health: A Narrative Review.,"The worldwide obesity epidemic has led to a drastic increase in diabetes and cardiovascular disease in younger generations. Further, maintaining metabolic health during aging is frequently a challenge due to poor diets and decreased mobility. In this setting, bioactive nutrients that are naturally occurring antioxidants, such as sulforaphane (SFN), are of high nutritional interest. SFN, a bioactive compound that is present in cruciferous vegetables, is a molecule that protects cells from cytotoxic damage and mitigates oxidative stress, protecting against disease. It exerts its action through the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Many studies have been performed in animals and humans to evaluate its effects on cancer, brain health, and neurodegenerative disorders. However, fewer clinical studies have been performed to evaluate its effects on insulin resistance and the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) across the lifespan. Given that, in some parts of the world, particularly in Europe, the population is growing older at a significant rate, it is crucial to promote healthy habits (healthy foods, dietary pattern, precision nutrition, and physical activity) from an early stage in life and across the lifespan to avoid debilitating health conditions occurring during adulthood and aging. Thus, in this narrative review, we discuss the protective effects of SFN supplementation on inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways and relate them to metabolic disease.",Alves I; Araújo EMQ; Dalgaard LT; Singh S; Børsheim E; Carvalho E,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39940284/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39939550,A Framework to Guide Defining an Upper Threshold of Crystalline Vitamin B12 in Foods and Food Supplements.,"To define an intake threshold of vitamin B12 from food supplements that is sufficient to maintain normal body functions, but it does not cause pharmacological effects. We used studies on the amount of B12 absorbed following oral B12 application and non-comparative case-series studies to synthesize evidence on pharmacological effects of oral B12 (between < 10 µg and 3000 µg) in people with manifested deficiency. There is a dose-dependent intestinal absorption of B12 and in the same time effects on body metabolism and functions. Food supplements providing ≤ 20 µg B12 daily are unlikely to cause pharmacological effects, while 50 µg might correct abnormal biochemical markers in some deficient patients. Foods for special medical purposes for people who cannot absorb B12 may contain 100 µg to 150 µg B12. This dose may ensure 1-4 µg of the vitamin reaching the circulation on a daily basis independent of intrinsic factor. Dosages ≥ 200 µg/d should be considered as drugs that can correct anemia, metabolic markers and clinical symptoms. The content of vitamin B12 in food supplements should not exceed 20 µg. In addition, people with deficiency should receive appropriate medical treatment with high dose B12.",Obeid R; Geisel J; Pietrzik K; Andres E,Current nutrition reports,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39939550/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39936826,"Analytical Review on Nutritional Deficiencies in Vegan Diets: Risks, Prevention, and Optimal Strategies.","Factors like health concerns, environmental issues, and ethics have driven the rapid rise in veganism's popularity over the last decade. While studies confirm that veganism reduces the risk of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease, significant challenges persist in meeting nutritional needs. This review identifies critical dietary deficiencies common in vegan diets, including inadequacies in vitamin B12, iron, calcium, vitamin D, Iodine, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids, and explores strategies to mitigate these risks. These deficiencies result in chronic diseases like anemia, osteoporosis, and neurological disorders. Hence, this review observes the clinical literature to establish causes and will discuss a supplement strategy to enhance these deficiencies. Economic accessibility to fortified foods and supplements poses additional challenges, particularly for low-income individuals or regions with limited access to vegan-friendly products. Addressing these barriers is essential to make vegan diets viable for all. Many of these nutrients, predominantly found in animal products, are difficult to obtain in sufficient amounts through plant-based diets alone, leading to potential health risks like anemia, osteoporosis, and neurological disorders. This study evaluates clinical literature to pinpoint the causes of these deficiencies and examines effective supplementation strategies to address them. Beyond highlighting the challenges, it discusses the environmental benefits of veganism, showing how plant-based diets significantly reduce water usage, land pressure, and greenhouse gas emissions. The study concludes that while a poorly planned vegan diet can lead to nutritional inadequacies, with proper dietary planning and personalized supplementation, vegan diets can support long-term health and promote environmental sustainability. Recommendations from experts are also included for tailoring vegan diets to meet individual health needs effectively.",Malhotra A; Lakade A,Journal of the American Nutrition Association,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39936826/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39904656,Effects of Coenzyme Q10 Supplementation on Metabolic Indicators in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a naturally occurring antioxidant that has been suggested to have beneficial effects on lipid profiles and blood pressure. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate the effects of CoQ10 supplementation on these parameters in patients with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). To assess the impact of CoQ10 supplementation on lipid profiles and blood pressure in individuals diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes. A systematic literature search was conducted in databases such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to July 2024. Studies included were those that examined the effects of CoQ10 supplementation on lipid profiles (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides) and blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) in T2D patients. 16 studies were included. CoQ10supplementation reduced SBP (WMD: -3.86 mmHg, 95% CI: -6.01 to -1.71, P = 0.014, I<sup>2</sup> = 83.7%; P < 0.001) and DBP (WMD: -2.70 mmHg, 95% CI: -4.50 to -0.91, P = 0.024, I<sup>2</sup> = 92.1%; P < 0.001), but did not change lipid profile. Additionally, subgroup analysis indicated that the effects of CoQ10 on lipid profiles levels were more pronounced in studies where the daily dosage of CoQ10 was 100 mg or less, and the duration of the study was under 12 weeks. Coenzyme Q10 supplementation appears to have a beneficial effect on lipid profiles and may contribute to lowering blood pressure in patients with Type 2 Diabetes. These findings suggest that CoQ10 could be a valuable adjunctive therapy for managing cardiovascular risk in this population. Additional in-depth research is needed to validate these findings and understand the underlying mechanisms in more detail.",Li Y; El-Sehrawy AAMA; Shankar A; Srivastava M; Mohammed JS; Hjazi A; Singh M; Sapaev IB; Mustafa YF; Abosaoda MK,Clinical therapeutics,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39904656/,0,1,0,1,0,0
39891959,Unraveling the link between magnesium and diabetic neuropathy: Evidence from in vitro to clinical studies.,"Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is one of the major complications of diabetes and the most common cause of neuropathic pain. Although the underlying pathological mechanisms remain unclear, several studies have produced conflicting results regarding the link between magnesium (Mg) concentration and DN. This ambiguity raises questions about the potential benefits of Mg supplementation in individuals with DN. Therefore, this comprehensive review summarizes and discusses the evidence from clinical, in vitro, and in vivo studies on the association between Mg and DN. Several findings indicate that Mg depletion is linked to the presence of neuropathy in diabetic patients. Additionally, low Mg concentration may contribute to the onset or worsening of DN by promoting axonal degeneration through various pathways. Furthermore, multiple studies have shown that Mg supplementation can have neuroprotective effects. These findings suggest potential as an alternative or complementary therapy for preventing and treating DN in the future.",Smithiseth K; Leurcharusmee P; Sawaddiruk P; Chattipakorn N; Chattipakorn S,"Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39891959/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39890230,The effects of prenatal multiple micronutrient supplementation and small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplementation on small vulnerable newborn types in low-income and middle-income countries: a meta-analysis of individual participant data.,"Small vulnerable newborn types, defined by combinations of being born too soon or too small, have distinct determinants and health consequences. We aimed to assess the effects of prenatal multiple micronutrient supplementation (MMS) and small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplementation (SQ-LNS) on small vulnerable newborn types, which are currently unknown. In this meta-analysis, individual participant data from randomised controlled trials of MMS and randomised controlled trials of SQ-LNS in low-income and middle-income countries were used. We systematically searched the literature using PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science to identify randomised controlled trials of prenatal nutritional supplementation using MMS or SQ-LNS among pregnant people published between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2021. Studies were excluded if they were conducted exclusively among participants selected by pre-existing health conditions, such as anaemia status, HIV infection, or diabetes. We contacted the corresponding authors of all identified studies to seek data contribution. As individual participant data became available, we mapped relevant variables and harmonised the data across studies. Iron and folic acid supplementation was the control group in most studies. Newborns were classified into ten groups through the combinations of preterm or term birth, small, appropriate, and large for gestational age, and low birthweight (LBW) or non-LBW. Newborns were also analysed using a four-group categorisation of preterm or term and LBW or non-LBW. Log-binomial models were used to estimate study-specific risk ratios (RRs), which were pooled using meta-analyses. 14 randomised controlled trials of MMS (n=42 618; the mean maternal age at study enrolment was 24·3 years [SD 5.6]; 22 086 [51·8%] male neonates and 20 532 [48·2%] female neonates) and four randomised controlled trials of SQ-LNS (n=6246; the mean maternal age at study enrolment was 23·3 years [SD 5·3]; 3137 [50·2%] male neonates and 3109 [49·8%] female neonates) were used. In the ten-group categorisation of small vulnerable newborns, prenatal MMS reduced the risk of preterm-small for gestational age (SGA)-LBW (RR 0·73, 95% CI 0·64-0·84; p=0·0003); preterm-appropriate for gestational age (AGA)-LBW (0·82, 0·74-0·91; p=0·0010); preterm-AGA-non-LBW (0·89, 0·80-0·98; p=0·019); term-SGA-LBW (0·91, 0·85-0·96; p=0·0046); and term-SGA-non-LBW (0·95, 0·90-1·00; p=0·050). In the four-group categorisation, prenatal MMS reduced the risk of preterm-SGA (0·71, 0·62-0·82; p=0·0002) and term-SGA (0·93, 0·89-0·98; p=0·0066). Prenatal SQ-LNS had no significant effects on the risk of giving birth to small vulnerable newborns except for preterm-large for gestational age-non-LBW in the ten-group categorisation (0·78, 0·65-0·94; p=0·023). Prenatal MMS and SQ-LNS reduce the risk of giving birth to small vulnerable newborns to varying extents, with the greatest magnitude of effects observed for small vulnerable newborn types that confer the greatest neonatal mortality risk.

39872318,The efficacy of resveratrol supplementation on inflammation and oxidative stress in type-2 diabetes mellitus patients: randomized double-blind placebo meta-analysis.,"The effects of resveratrol supplementation on inflammation and oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were controversial. A meta-analysis was performed to assess the changes in levels of inflammation and oxidative stress in patients with T2DM. Relevant literatures before November 6, 2024 were screened through Web of Science,Embase,the Cochrane Library and other sources (ClinicalTrials, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses). The quality of the literature was evaluated according to the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews. The study quality was assessed using the risk-of-bias 2 tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment,Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Review Manager 5.3 conducted meta-analysis of the data included in the literature. This meta-analysis was conducted in six randomized controlled trials involving 533 participants. Our results showed that supplementation with resveratrol significantly reduced C-reactive protein levels(SMD = -1.40, 95%CI(-2.60, -0.21), P = 0.02; Level of evidence: low), lipid peroxide levels (SMD = -0.99, 95%CI(-1.36, -0.61), P < 0.00001; Level of evidence: low), 8-isoprostanes(SMD = -0.79, 95%CI(-1.16, -0.42), P < 0.0001; Level of evidence: low) and oxidative stress score (SMD = -1.62, 95%CI(-2.49, -0.75), P = 0.0003; Level of evidence: very low). In addition, compared to placebo, Supplementation with resveratrol significantly increased glutathione peroxidase levels (SMD = 0.38, 95%CI(0.03, 0.74), P = 0.04; Level of evidence:low) and catalase levels (SMD = 0.33, 95%CI(0.03, 0.63), P = 0.03; Level of evidence: low). However, no significant difference was observed in improving interleukin-6 levels (SMD = -1.35, 95%CI(-2.75, -0.05), P = 0.06; Level of evidence: very low), tumor necrosis factor α levels (SMD = -3.30, 95%CI(-7.47, 0.87), P = 0.12; Level of evidence: very low), superoxide dismutase levels (SMD = 0.39, 95%CI(-0.26, 1.04), P = 0.24; Level of evidence: very low), total antioxidant capacity levels (SMD = 0.39, 95%CI(-0.23, 1.00), P = 0.21; Level of evidence: very low) and malondialdehyde levels (SMD = -3.36, 95%CI(-10.30, 3.09), P = 0.29; Level of evidence: very low). Resveratrol improved inflammation and oxidative stress in T2DM patients to some extent. This provides a new idea and method for clinical treatment.

39861407,Vitamin D: Evidence-Based Health Benefits and Recommendations for Population Guidelines.,"Vitamin D offers numerous under-recognized health benefits beyond its well-known role in musculoskeletal health. It is vital for extra-renal tissues, prenatal health, brain function, immunity, pregnancy, cancer prevention, and cardiovascular health. Existing guidelines issued by governmental and health organizations are bone-centric and largely overlook the abovementioned extra-skeletal benefits and optimal thresholds for vitamin D. In addition, they rely on randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which seldom show benefits due to high baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations, moderate supplementation doses, and flawed study designs. This review emphasizes the findings from prospective cohort studies showing that higher 25(OH)D concentrations reduce the risks of major diseases and mortality, including pregnancy and birth outcomes. Serum concentrations > 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) significantly lower disease and mortality risks compared to <20 ng/mL. With 25% of the U.S. population and 60% of Central Europeans having levels <20 ng/mL, concentrations should be raised above 30 ng/mL. This is achievable through daily supplementation with 2000 IU/day (50 mcg/day) of vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, which prevent diseases and deaths. Furthermore, a daily dose between 4000 and 6000 IU of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> to achieve serum 25(OH)D levels between 40 and 70 ng/mL would provide greater protection against many adverse health outcomes. Future guidelines and recommendations should integrate the findings from observational prospective cohort studies and well-designed RCTs to improve public health and personalized care.",Grant WB; Wimalawansa SJ; Pludowski P; Cheng RZ,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39861407/,1,0,0,0,0,1
39848238,An Overview of Early-Life Gut Microbiota Modulation Strategies.,"The gut microbiota, or microbiome, is essential for human health. Early-life factors such as delivery mode, diet, and antibiotic use shape its composition, impacting both short- and long-term health outcomes. Dysbiosis, or alterations in the gut microbiota, is linked to conditions such as allergies, asthma, obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants. This article reviews current strategies to influence the early-life gut microbiome and their potential health impacts. It also briefly summarizes guidelines on using biotics for gastrointestinal and allergic diseases in children. Key strategies include vaginal or fecal microbiota transplantation for cesarean-born infants, breastfeeding, and biotic-supplemented formulas. While vaginal microbial transfer and maternal fecal microbiota transplantation show short-term benefits, further research is needed to determine long-term safety and efficacy. Breast milk, rich in human milk oligosaccharides, promotes a healthy microbiota and offers protection against infections. Biotic-supplemented formulas can improve the gut microbiota in formula-fed infants and show clinical effects, though each biotic must be evaluated separately. Probiotics given as dietary supplements outside of infant formulas show promise for treating gastrointestinal disorders but require further investigation.",Szajewska H,Annals of nutrition & metabolism,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39848238/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39833730,International expert consensus on micronutrient supplement use during the early life course.,"Growing evidence demonstrates that maternal nutrition is crucial for the health of the mother-to-be, and early life course of the offspring. However, for most micronutrients, guidelines are inconsistent. This Delphi study aimed to investigate the level of expert consensus on maternal nutrition and micronutrient needs during preconception, pregnancy and lactation. We conducted a two-round web-based Delphi survey on various topics including general approaches to diet and supplement use, and existing guidelines. For the periods of preconception, pregnancy and lactation, questions focused on the importance and strength of evidence for supplement use with the following micronutrients for low- and high-risk populations: folic acid, choline, iodine, magnesium, calcium, iron, selenium, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and vitamins B1, B2, B6, B12, D and K. Thirty-five experts participated in the panel, who were healthcare professionals (HCPs), researchers and joint HCP-researchers with expertise in nutrition, gynaecology and/or obstetrics. Panellists reached consensus on the importance of diet and dietary supplement use during pregnancy and agreed on the lack of clarity and consistency in current guidelines, and the need for education in these areas for HCPs, pregnant people and the general population. For general low-risk populations, there was consensus on the importance of supplement use with iron and vitamin D from preconception through lactation, with folic acid and iodine from preconception through the second and third trimesters, respectively, with DHA from the first trimester through lactation and with calcium during lactation. Panellists agreed that the evidence for supplement use with each of these micronutrients during these phases to improve outcomes and/or foetal development is strong, except for vitamin D (preconception), DHA (first trimester), and iron (both periods). There was also consensus that supplement use advice should be tailored for people following vegan/vegetarian diets, restricted diets due to food intolerances, obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and previous nutrition-related pregnancy complications. The findings revealed robust consensus on various aspects of maternal nutrition, including the need for education, the lack of consistency in current guidelines on supplement use, the importance of supplement use across specific phases of pregnancy and the at-risk groups requiring tailored approaches.",Cetin I; Devlieger R; Isolauri E; Obeid R; Parisi F; Pilz S; van Rossem L; Steegers-Theunissen R,BMC pregnancy and childbirth,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39833730/,0,0,0,0,0,0

To address this, we conducted an umbrella review to synthesize the evidence on these effects. A systematic literature search in Web of science, PubMed, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was performed from 2012 to November 2022. he quality of the meta-analyses was assessed using AMSTAR-2 and GRADE. Fourteen systematic reviews and meta-analyses met the inclusion criteria, examining the effects of five water-soluble vitamins (B-1, B-3, biotin, B-9, and C) on glycemic control and insulin resistance. The findings suggest that vitamin C supplementation can improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, as indicated by reduced FBG and HbA1c, with more significant effects observed for durations longer than 30 days. Insulin resistance is improved by folic acid supplementations. More well-designed individual randomized controlled trials are needed in the future, as well as meta-analysis of higher quality.",Chai Y; Chen C; Yin X; Wang X; Yu W; Pan H; Qin R; Yang X; Wang Q,Asia Pacific journal of clinical nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39828265/,0,1,0,0,0,0
39821819,Dietary flaxseed: Cardiometabolic benefits and its role in promoting healthy aging.,"Flaxseed, a rich source of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), lignans, and soluble fiber, has attracted attention for its potential to improve multiple cardiometabolic risk factors. While its benefits are well-recognized, comprehensive evaluations of its direct impact on clinical outcomes, such as the prevention or progression of cardiometabolic diseases, remain limited. Additionally, its potential to support healthy aging and longevity through fundamental biological mechanisms has not been fully elucidated. This review synthesizes existing research on flaxseed supplementation, highlighting its effects on cardiometabolic risk factors and outcomes, the underlying biological mechanisms, and its broader implications for health promotion and aging. Findings demonstrate that flaxseed supplementation significantly improves several cardiometabolic risk factors, including body weight, body mass index, lipid levels, blood pressure, glycemic measures, markers of inflammation (e.g., C-reactive protein and interleukin-6), oxidative stress, and liver enzymes. Blood pressure reductions range from approximately 2 to 15 mmHg for systolic blood pressure and 1 to 7 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure, with the magnitude influenced by dose, duration, and baseline risk profiles. While direct evidence linking flaxseed to the prevention of hypertension, metabolic syndrome, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease is limited, its bioactive components-ALA, lignans, and fiber-are strongly associated with reduced risks of these conditions. The benefits of flaxseed are mediated through multiple pathways, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, improved lipid levels, improved glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, modulation of gut microbiota, and enhanced vascular health. Beyond cardiometabolic outcomes, flaxseed may influence key biological processes relevant to aging, underscoring its potential to promote healthy aging and longevity. Optimal cardiometabolic benefits appear to be achieved with ground whole flaxseed at doses of ≥ 30 g/day for at least 12 weeks, particularly among individuals at high cardiometabolic risk.

39818282,"The effect of saffron supplementation on liver and kidney function, blood glucose and pressure in patients with diabetes and prediabetes: A grade assessed systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.","Saffron has been traditionally used for various health benefits, but its effects on biomarkers of liver function, kidney function, and blood pressure in diabetes are not well understood. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the impact of saffron supplementation on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), fasting blood glucose (FBG), liver enzymes (ALT, AST), and kidney function markers (BUN, creatinine) in patients with diabetes and prediabetes. A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing saffron/crocin supplementation on glycemic control, hepatic and renal function, and blood pressure regulation in patients with diabetes and prediabetes. Data were extracted and analyzed using random effects model to determine the effect sizes and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for each biomarker. The GRADE framework was employed to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Thirteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. Saffron supplementation significantly reduced SBP (SMD = -0.57, 95 % CI: -0.8 to -0.34, p = 0.036) with the high certainty of evidence, FBG (SMD = -0.57, 95 % CI: -0.93 to -0.22, p = 0.001) with the low certainty of evidence, and AST (SMD = -0.49, 95 % CI: -0.97 to -0.00, p = 0.049) with the low certainty of evidence. Other studied biomarkers were not affected significantly by saffron/crocin supplementation. Saffron/crocin supplementation is effective in decreasing AST, SBP, and FBG levels in patients with diabetes and prediabetes. However, it has no significant effect on ALT, renal function, and DBP. Our observed effect sizes on AST, SBP, and FBG are not clinically important.",Zhang JW; Zhao Q; Li Z; Liu Q; Zang SS; Liu S,Prostaglandins & other lipid mediators,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39818282/,0,1,0,1,0,0
39806201,Probiotics Supplementation for Improving Glucolipid Parameters in Individuals with Prediabetes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Trials.,"The absence of suitable intervention significantly increases the likelihood of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) development in people with prediabetes. Recent statistical findings indicate that the gut microbiome might influences the development of insulin resistance. The objective of our study was to assess the efficacy and safety of probiotic supplementation in individuals diagnosed with prediabetes. A thorough search was carried out on the Cochrane Library, Medline, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases until September 12th, 2024, using a mix of pertinent keywords. This review incorporates randomized clinical trials (RCTs) concerning the effect of probiotics for prediabetes. We used random-effect models to examine the mean difference (MD). A total of eight RCTs were incorporated. The results of our meta-analysis indicated that probiotics supplementation was associated with higher reduction in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (MD -0.07% (95% CI -0.11, -0.03), p = 0.0005, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%) among individuals with prediabetes when compared to placebo. Other indicators such as total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), and body mass index (BMI) did not differ significantly between probiotics and placebo. No significant difference was observed in the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) between the two groups.

39800313,Effect of Prebiotic Supplementation on Health Status in Adults with Prediabetes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials.,"Prediabetes with a considerable progression rate is a primary risk factor for type 2 diabetes if left untreated. Dietary interventions examining the health effects of prebiotic consumption on health status have been studied in subjects with prediabetes, but the results are controversial. This study aimed to investigate whether prebiotic consumption can favorably alter metabolic status as well as anthropometric features in subjects with prediabetes. Electronic databases were searched up to January 2024, and randomized clinical trials examining the effect of prebiotic consumption on glycemic status, lipid profile, and/or anthropometric features in adults with prediabetes were selected. Data from 11 selected studies were extracted. In total, 546 subjects were included in our analysis, of whom 258 were allocated to prebiotic supplemented group and 288 to control group. Our results demonstrated a significant reduction in body fat (BF) percentage (standardized mean difference: -1.27 %, 95% confidence interval: -2.33, -0.22) after prebiotic supplementation. We found no significant alterations in metabolic indices, including fasting plasma glucose, insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. In addition, we did not notice a significant effect of prebiotic consumption on other anthropometrics, including body mass index and waist circumference. There was no fair evidence that prebiotic consumption could improve metabolic and anthropometric features in subjects with prediabetes. Yet, a significant reduction in BF might support the beneficial effect of prebiotics when aiming at preventing diabetes through lifestyle modifications and weight management. In addition, the reduction in BF can be of clinical significance, indicating the potential of prebiotics to increase insulin sensitivity, which can positively affect people with prediabetes. Nevertheless, current findings should be taken with caution due to the very low certainty in the pooled estimate for the majority of outcomes. Future studies are needed to investigate the effect of prebiotics on health status in people with prediabetes.

39798849,Flavonoids for gastrointestinal tract local and associated systemic effects: A review of clinical trials and future perspectives.,"Flavonoids are naturally occurring dietary phytochemicals with significant antioxidant effects aside from several health benefits. People often consume them in combination with other food components. Compiling data establishes a link between bioactive flavonoids and prevention of several diseases in animal models, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, gut dysbiosis, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). However, numerous clinical studies have demonstrated the ineffectiveness of flavonoids contradicting rodent models, thereby challenging the validity of using flavonoids as dietary supplements. This review provides a clinical perspective to emphasize the effective roles of dietary flavonoids as well as to summarize their specific mechanisms in animals briefly. First, this review offers an in-depth elucidation of the metabolic processes of flavonoids within human, encompassing the small, large intestine, and the liver. Furthermore, the review provides a comprehensive overview of the various functions of flavonoids in the gastrointestinal tract, including hindering the breakdown and assimilation of macronutrients, such as polysaccharides and lipids, regulating gut hormone secretion as well as inhibition of mineral iron absorption. In the large intestine, an unabsorbed major portion of flavonoids interact with the gut flora leading to their biotransformation. Once absorbed and circulated in the bloodstream, bioactive flavonoids or their metabolites exert numerous beneficial systemic effects. Lastly, we examine the protective effects of flavonoids in several metabolic disorders, including endothelial dysfunction, MASLD, cardiovascular disease, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance. In conclusion, this review outlines the safety and future prospects of flavonoids in the field of health, especially in the prevention of metabolic syndrome (MetS).",Li X; Xie E; Sun S; Shen J; Ding Y; Wang J; Peng X; Zheng R; Farag MA; Xiao J,Journal of advanced research,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39798849/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Associations between thyroid disorders and nutritional factors have been established in former studies. The Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus databases and Google Scholar were searched without date restriction until June 2023 by using relevant keywords. All original articles written in English that studied the effects of vitamin D supplementation on TSH and thyroid hormones were eligible for the present review. The present review included a total of 16 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 1127 participants (intervention group, 630; control group, 497). Based on the findings made, vitamin D supplementation had no significant effects on serum TSH levels in 9 cases (56.2%) reported in the trials. However, TSH levels were elevated in 4 studies (26.6%) and low in 3 (18.7%) cases after vitamin D administration. Four cases reported in 6 RCTs and 4 cases reported in 5 trials indicated no significant effects on thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>) and triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>) levels after vitamin D supplementation, respectively. Moreover, 8 cases of 11 included RCTs reported that vitamin D intake had no significant effects on fT4, and 5 cases of 7 RCTs demonstrated no significant effects on fT3 levels after vitamin D supplementation. Most findings suggest that vitamin D supplementation had no significant effects on thyroid hormones and more than half indicated no significant effect on TSH levels. Nevertheless, high-quality research is further required to prove these achievements and evaluate vitamin D effects on other markers of thyroid function.",Safari S; Shojaei-Zarghani S; Molani-Gol R; Rafraf M; Malekian M,"Endocrinologia, diabetes y nutricion",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39794009/,0,1,0,0,0,0

39733509,"Vitamin D, immune function, and atherosclerosis. Where are we now?","The role of vitamin D in regulating calcium metabolism and skeletal growth and disease is widely recognized. Indeed, current recommendations for serum vitamin D concentrations are based on these parameters. A serum vitamin D <20 ng/mL is considered deficient, concentrations between 20 and 30 ng/mL are insufficient, and >30 ng/mL is adequate. However, over the past number of years, epidemiological studies, randomized clinical trials, and preclinical animal and cell culture-based research have demonstrated that vitamin D modulates immune function. Cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and in industrialized nations, is mediated in part by chronic inflammation as well as by other well-established risk factors including dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes. Vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/mL or <50 nM) is associated with increased CVD risk. As described in this review, several recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses provide some evidence that vitamin D administration to individuals with vitamin D deficiency may have little effect on CVD-related mortality. Many well-designed randomized clinical trials in the general population as well as in people at risk for CVD-related complication later in life provide evidence that treatment may be beneficial. These latter studies as well as the paucity of information regarding the optimal vitamin D concentration required for optimizing immune function in patients indicate that more research is needed to address whether vitamin D supplements may be a cost-effective intervention for preventing CVD.",Rivero A; Wehmeier KR; Haas MJ; Mooradian AD,"Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39733509/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39731722,An overview of the nutritional quality and health benefits linked to the world diversity of citrus fruits/juices.,"Citrus juices represent a nutrient-dense beverage due to the remarkable balance in their bioactive compounds (vitamins, minerals, dietary fibers, and phytochemicals such as flavonoids and carotenoids). This review aims to examine the nutritional quality and the health benefits of citrus juice consumption linked to the world diversity of citrus fruits. This work provides heterogenous data found on the main citrus bioactive compounds, especially carotenoids and flavonoids, which are difficult to correlate to particular geographic areas. Through an example of study, this work addresses the question of how and to what extent the content of citrus bioactive compounds is linked to the health benefits observed in humans. We explore through the more recent human clinical trials, the health effects of consuming citrus fruit or taking dietary supplements of bioactive compounds to prevent the exponential increase of world chronic diseases (type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and obesity) and discuss the effects of dose. Finally, even if the data highlight the importance of geographical origin in accumulation of carotenoids or flavonoids from different Citrus species, the difference of content in front of the complex human metabolism of their absorption has lesser consequences for health than the fact of consuming citrus or not. The citrus health effect results in a synergistic action of numerous phytochemicals whose targeted health benefits vary depending more on the diversity of Citrus species than their geographic origin. Therefore, the use of the diversity of Citrus species could be an interesting approach to providing functional food.",Dhuique-Mayer C; Servent A,Journal of food science,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39731722/,1,0,0,0,0,0

In this study, we retrieved case reports through a published literature search using PubMed and spontaneous reporting data using the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) to identify potential cannabis- and cannabinoid-drug interactions in individuals younger than 18 years old. To evaluate the published case reports, we used the Drug Interaction Probability Scale (DIPS), a 10-item questionnaire designed to discern the causal relationship between a potential drug interaction and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). FAERS reports were deduplicated and analyzed to gather information regarding patient demographics, associated drugs, nature of the ADRs, outcomes, professions of the reporters, and reporting timelines. Seven published case reports and 9142 FAERS ADRs reports were included in the final analysis. Based on the findings, caution is warranted when cannabis or cannabinoids are used in combination with prescribed medications, including methadone, everolimus, fluoxetine, and paroxetine.

39719172,Probiotic supplement for the treatment of polycystic ovarian syndrome.,"Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome is one of the major prevalent causes of infertility reported worldwide nearly 6-26 %, especially in girls hitting puberty and women at their childbearing age. The main clinical manifestations include irregular menstrual cycle, small cysts on one or both ovaries, chronic oligo-anovulation, and hirsutism. The etiological criteria are very complex and related to many factors like obesity, insulin sensitivity, inflammation, hyperandrogenism, diabetes mellitus type II, cardiovascular diseases, and dysbiosis of gut microbiota. The given review focuses on managing PCOS through probiotics by analyzing the effects on the symptoms of the disease. The probiotics effective in treating PCOS belong to Bifidobacterium, Lactobacilli, Clostridium, Enterococcus, and other Lactic acid bacteria. Its significance in PCOS is mainly due to the antagonizing of the growth of pathogenic microorganisms, increasing intestinal mucus layer production, reducing intestinal permeability, and modulating the gastrointestinal immune system. Also, their interaction with certain hormones such as insulin, androgen, and estrogen through short-chain fatty acids influences fertility. More research is necessary to validate these results.

The use of Foods for Special Medical Purposes, including Oral Nutritional Supplements, and supplements is crucial to support patients in achieving their nutritional needs. Therefore, this article aims to comprehensively provide an analysis of the adequacy of FSMPs in meeting the nutritional requirements of different age-related diseases and takes into account the emerging role of inflammation. Moreover, it provides an identikit of the ideal products, following the pathology-specific guidelines. Data on 132 products were gathered through face-to-face meetings with companies' consultants. Specifically, information on energy, macronutrient, and micronutrient contents were collected, as well as on texture and flavors, osmolarity, cost, and packaging. Most FSMPs met the daily recommendations for energy and protein intake. Nonetheless, few products contained β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate, optimal Branched-Chain Amino Acids ratios, arginine, glutamine, and omega-3 fatty acids. Furthermore, a marked predominance of FSMPs with a high osmolarity (85.7%), sweet taste (72%), and only animal protein content (79.5%) was observed. Cost analysis of FSMPs revealed a mean cost of EUR 5.35/portion. Products were mostly adequate for cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, end-stage kidney disease, dysphagiam and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, gaps have been found for sarcopenia and abdominal surgery. In light of the current market landscape, there is a need for a comprehensive regulation that indicates the optimal composition of FSMPs and the production of such products to tackle disease-related malnutrition.",Madini N; Vincenti A; Beretta A; Santero S; Viroli G; Cena H,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39683535/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39683465,Vitamin D Supplementation as a Therapeutic Strategy in Autoimmune Diabetes: Insights and Implications for LADA Management.,"Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) is the most prevalent form of autoimmune diabetes (AI-D) in adulthood; however, its accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment remain challenging. Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is commonly observed in LADA patients, while increased vitamin D exposure through supplementation and dietary intake is associated with a reduced incidence of LADA. Although limited, case reports, case-control studies, and randomized clinical trials have examined the effects of vitamin D supplementation-alone or combined with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4-is)-on glucose regulation, residual β-cell function, and glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GADA65) levels. Findings, while preliminary, indicate that vitamin D supplementation may enhance glycemic control, preserve β-cell function, and reduce autoimmune activity. Given its accessibility, affordability, and relative safety, vitamin D supplementation presents an attractive adjunct treatment option for LADA patients. This narrative review discusses current evidence on the potential therapeutic benefits of vitamin D supplementation in patients with AI-D, including LADA, who are also vitamin D deficient. Beginning with an exploration of the epidemiological patterns, clinical presentation, and diagnostic framework essential for understanding and identifying LADA, this review then examines the proposed mechanisms through which vitamin D may influence autoimmune modulation of pancreatic β-cells, integrating recent data pertinent to LADA pathology. By distilling and consolidating existing research, we aim to provide a platform for advancing targeted investigations within this distinct patient population.",Mourelatou NG; Kounatidis D; Jude EB; Rebelos E,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39683465/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39682954,The Influence and Mechanisms of Natural Plant Polysaccharides on Intestinal Microbiota-Mediated Metabolic Disorders.,"Natural plant polysaccharides are renowned for their broad spectrum of biological activities, making them invaluable in both the pharmaceutical and food industries. Their safety, characterized by low toxicity and minimal side effects, coupled with their potential therapeutic properties, positions them as crucial elements in health-related applications. The functional effectiveness of these polysaccharides is deeply connected to their structural attributes, including molecular weight, monosaccharide components, and types of glycosidic bonds. These structural elements influence how polysaccharides interact with the gut microbiota, potentially alleviating various metabolic and inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, liver-associated pathologies, obesity, and kidney diseases. The polysaccharides operate through a range of biological mechanisms. They enhance the formation of short-chain fatty acids, which are pivotal in keeping intestinal health and metabolic balance. Additionally, they strengthen the intestinal mucosal barrier, crucial for deterring the ingress of pathogens and toxins into the host system. By modulating the immune responses within the gut, they help in managing immune-mediated disorders, and their role in activating specific cellular signaling pathways further underscores their therapeutic potential.

39661860,Effects of host modulation through omega-3 dietary supplementation on inflammatory outcomes in periodontitis: a scoping review.,"Inflammation causes the progressive destruction of the supporting tissues around teeth in patients with periodontitis. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the immunological effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) as adjunctive therapy in patients with periodontal disease and identify potential biomarkers for the disease. This scoping review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to investigate the impact of omega-3 therapy with or without acetylsalicylic acid on the immunological parameters of periodontal treatment. Eligible studies included those conducted on patients with normoglycemia and diabetes, published after 2002 in English, and containing relevant keywords. The exclusion criteria included pre-2002 publications, literature reviews, animal studies, and articles without immunological analysis. This review involved careful study selection by two double-blind researchers using the Rayyan software, with data extraction and analysis performed by the third and fourth reviewers. Seven randomized clinical trials that compared control/placebo and n-3 PUFA groups or the follow-ups of the n-3 PUFA groups were included. The concentration of inflammatory cytokines was reduced following dietary supplementation with n-3 PUFA in the reviewed studies. Specifically, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and RANKL levels were reduced after dietary supplementation with n-3 PUFA as an adjunctive therapy for periodontitis. Changes in inflammatory outcomes were associated with the clinical benefits of periodontitis. However, significant divergence in the evaluated inflammatory markers, samples, and methods impairs direct comparisons and quantitative analyses in the available literature. This study highlights the need for clinical trials to advance our understanding and assessment of inflammatory outcomes in patients with periodontitis.",Carlucci AR; Bergo BR; Silva RNB; Bressane GD; Baeza M; Santos NCD,"Einstein (Sao Paulo, Brazil)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39661860/,0,0,0,0,0,1
39655722,The Multifaceted Applications of Seaweed and Its Derived Compounds in Biomedicine and Nutraceuticals: A Promising Resource for Future.,"The increasing demand for global food resources and over-dependence on terrestrial agroecosystems pose a significant challenge to the sustainable production of food commodities. Macroalgae are an essential source of food production in the marine environment, and their cultivation is a promising approach to alleviate the impending global food insecurity due to key factors, such as independence from terrestrial agriculture, rapid growth rate, unique biochemical composition, and carbon capture potential. Moreover, in many countries, seaweed has been used as food for decades because of its health and nutritional benefits. Seaweed contains bioactive components that are beneficial against various pathological conditions, including cancer, type 2 diabetes, and neurological disorders. Furthermore, the natural products derived from macroalgae have also been found to have immunostimulatory and antimicrobial properties. Macroalgae are also a significant source of rare sugars such as L-fucose, L-rhamnose, and glucuronic acid. Besides sugars, other bioactive components have been widely reported for their potential in cosmeceuticals. We have outlined the nutrient composition and functional properties of different species of macroalgae, with an emphasis on their potential as value-added products to the functional food market. Beyond being nutritional powerhouses, the variety of biological activities in human health and biomedicine makes them excellent candidates for developing novel drugs. Therefore, this review summarizes the pharmaceutical applications of macroalgae and suggests potential strategies for incorporating macroalgae-derived bioactive compounds into therapeutic products.",Hyderi Z; Kannappan A; Ravi AV,Phytochemical analysis : PCA,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39655722/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39647584,"Betaine and aging: A narrative review of findings, possible mechanisms, research perspectives, and practical recommendations.","The rapid aging of the global population necessitates addressing age-related conditions through innovative strategies. Nutritional supplements have emerged as potential interventions for preventing or slowing age-related changes, with betaine being a promising candidate. This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of current literature on the impact of betaine on the aging process. Specifically, we summarize the mechanisms through which betaine is proposed to affect aging, we integrate existing findings, we identify gaps in the literature, and we discuss practical implications for promoting healthy aging. Evidence suggests that betaine may counteract aging-related changes in methylation potential by increasing concentration of S-adenosylmethionine, a key methyl donor. Additionally, betaine reduces homocysteine concentrations, potentially mitigating vascular, neurodegenerative, and oxidative damage. Betaine has also been shown to enhance mitochondrial function, to reduce oxidative stress, and to attenuate inflammation. It may serve as a preventive agent against sarcopenia by promoting anabolic signaling pathways and improving muscle strength in younger adults. Betaine may also exert an effect on bone remodeling and adipose tissue metabolism, with animal studies indicating enhanced fat oxidation and reduced fat synthesis. Although certain limited studies have suggested betaine's potential in mitigating age-related neurodegenerative diseases, the currently available evidence does not establish a clear link between dietary betaine intake and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases or type-2 diabetes. In conclusion, emerging evidence highlights the potential of betaine in attenuating age-related changes. However, further research is required to elucidate the efficacy and safety of betaine supplementation in older populations.",Zawieja E; Chmurzynska A,Ageing research reviews,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39647584/,0,1,0,0,0,0
39608572,Exploring Opportunities to Better Characterize the Effects of Dietary Protein on Health across the Lifespan.,"Remarkable advances have been made over the last 30 y in understanding the role of dietary protein in optimizing muscle health across the lifespan. That is, acute (<24 h) stable isotope-derived measures of muscle protein synthesis have led to established recommendations for protein quantity, quality, source, and timing of protein ingestion to support muscle health at rest, post exercise, and to overcome age-related anabolic resistance in older adults. Although muscle health is undoubtedly important, moving from muscle to other associated or disease-specific outcomes is a critical next step for the field, given the mounting evidence documenting the effects of dietary protein on measures of chronic disease and age-related decline (for example, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, frailty, and osteoporosis). In this narrative review, we posit that future studies evaluating the potential role of dietary protein build off of the existing knowledge base generated from decades of past research and focus their efforts on closing unanswered knowledge gaps pertaining to dietary protein and health across the lifespan. Throughout this review, we highlight potential methodologies and novel outcome measures that researchers may consider as starting points to facilitate the next 30 y of advances in the field of dietary protein and health.",Carbone JW; Phillips SM; Weaver CM; Hughes JM; Pasiakos SM,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39608572/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39599755,"Integrating Endocrine, Genomic, and Extra-Skeletal Benefits of Vitamin D into National and Regional Clinical Guidelines.","Vitamin D is essential for bone health, immune function, and overall well-being. Numerous ecological, observational, and prospective studies, including randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs), report an inverse association between higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D; calcifediol] levels in various conditions, including cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity, susceptibility to infection-related complications, autoimmune diseases, and all-cause mortality. Vitamin D operates through two distinct systems. The endocrine system comprises the renal tubular cell-derived circulatory calcitriol, which primarily regulates calcium homeostasis and muscular functions. In contrast, intracellularly generated calcitriol in peripheral target cells is responsible for intracrine/paracrine system signaling and calcitriol-vitamin D receptor-mediated genomic effects. Government-appointed committees and health organizations have developed various clinical practice guidelines for vitamin D supplementation and management. However, these guidelines heavily relied on the 2011 Institute of Medicine (IoM) report, which focused solely on the skeletal effects of vitamin D, ignoring other body systems. Thus, they do not represent maintaining good overall health and aspects of disease prevention. Additionally, the IoM report was intended as a public health recommendation for the government and is not a clinical guideline. New country- and regional-specific guidelines must focus on healthy nations through disease prevention and reducing healthcare costs. They should not be restricted to bone effect and must encompass all extra-skeletal benefits. Nevertheless, due to misunderstandings, medical societies and other governments have used faulty IoM report as a foundation for creating vitamin D guidelines. Consequently, they placed disproportionate emphasis on bone health while largely overlooking its benefits for other bodily systems, making current guidelines, including 2024, the Endocrine Society less applicable to the public. As a result, the utility of published guidelines has been significantly reduced for clinical practice and RCTs that designed on bone-centric are generate misleading information and remain suboptimal for public health and disease prevention. This review and its recommendations address the gaps in current vitamin D clinical practice guidelines and propose a framework for developing more effective, country and region-specific recommendations that capture the extra-skeletal benefits of vitamin D to prevent multiple diseases and enhance public health.",Wimalawansa SJ; Weiss ST; Hollis BW,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39599755/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39599740,Targeting the Gut Microbiota for Prevention and Management of Type 2 Diabetes.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic disorder with a heterogeneous etiology encompassing societal and behavioral risk factors in addition to genetic and environmental susceptibility. The cardiovascular consequences of diabetes account for more than two-thirds of mortality among people with T2D. Not only does T2D shorten life expectancy, but it also lowers quality of life and is associated with extremely high health expenditures since diabetic complications raise both direct and indirect healthcare costs. An increasing body of research indicates a connection between T2D and gut microbial traits, as numerous alterations in the intestinal microorganisms have been noted in pre-diabetic and diabetic individuals. These include pro-inflammatory bacterial patterns, increased intestinal permeability, endotoxemia, and hyperglycemia-favoring conditions, such as the alteration of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion. Restoring microbial homeostasis can be very beneficial for preventing and co-treating T2D and improving antidiabetic therapy outcomes. This review summarizes the characteristics of a ""diabetic"" microbiota and the metabolites produced by microbial species that can worsen or ameliorate T2D risk and progression, suggesting gut microbiota-targeted strategies to restore eubiosis and regulate blood glucose. Nutritional supplementation, diet, and physical exercise are known to play important roles in T2D, and here their effects on the gut microbiota are discussed, suggesting non-pharmacological approaches that can greatly help in diabetes management and highlighting the importance of tailoring treatments to individual needs.",Donati Zeppa S; Gervasi M; Bartolacci A; Ferrini F; Patti A; Sestili P; Stocchi V; Agostini D,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39599740/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39599690,High Doses of Vitamin D and Specific Metabolic Parameters in Type 2 Diabetes Patients: Systematic Review.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is recognized as a condition of mild chronic inflammation, marked by increased levels of acute-phase proteins and various inflammatory indicators. These inflammatory substances, along with inflammation of adipose tissue and the secretion of adipocytokines, can contribute to insulin resistance and β cell dysfunction. By influencing both innate and adaptive immunity, vitamin D can inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines and help mitigate the low-grade chronic inflammation associated with T2DM. Several strategies have been proposed to increase vitamin D levels effectively and safely, but the recent and strong ones have common tactics. Short-term high doses increase the level acutely, and long-term lower doses maintain sufficient levels. <b>Methods:</b> The aim of our work was to determine and verify the effectiveness of high doses of vitamin D to safely increase its level in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as the effect of these doses on selected metabolic parameters. Data from 20 studies (vitamin D group <i>n</i> = 612, and control group <i>n</i> = 592) regarding the influence of vitamin D supplementation with doses above 4000 IU on serum 25(OH)D, fasting blood glucose (FBG), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), blood pressure, serum calcium, and parathormone were pooled. <b>Results:</b> Vitamin D supplementation significantly improved serum 25(OH)D levels, with an average increase after intervention versus baseline at 177.09%. Our studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation may benefit various parameters in T2DM patients, including glycemic control, blood pressure, and PTH levels. <b>Conclusions:</b> Vitamin D supplementation may have beneficial effects on various parameters in type 2 diabetes patients, including glycemic control, blood pressure, and parathormone levels.

39596298,Nutritional and Nutraceutical Support to the Failing Myocardium: A Possible Way of Potentiating the Current Treatment of Heart Failure.,"Heart failure (HF) is a complex condition that affects 1-2% of the global population. The presence of comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or obesity has been shown in various studies to elevate mortality and hospitalization rates in HF patients. Insufficient outcomes persist in HF, necessitating additional research to address unmet needs in disease management. Lifestyle modifications, including smoking cessation, decreased alcohol consumption, regular exercise, cardiac rehabilitation, and a balanced diet, can prevent and treat a wide range of HF cases. In this review, we aimed to examine how lifestyle changes, nutrition, and nutraceutical supplements can play a role in preventing heart failure and supporting its treatment. A detailed and comprehensive analysis of the most recent data present in the literature could help identify potential candidates for future clinical trials in HF management. There is a growing body of evidence supporting the importance of closely monitoring nutritional balance, including micronutrients and nutraceuticals, in HF patients for better symptom management and outcomes. Despite promising results from initial approaches, the lack of conclusive evidence from recent studies and meta-analyses questions the widespread use of nutraceutical supplementation in HF patients. Further studies are necessary to determine the most effective way to use nutraceutical supplementation in the treatment of myocardial dysfunction in HF patients.",Macrì R; Mollace R; Serra M; Scarano F; Ritorto G; Ussia S; Cardamone A; Coppoletta AR; Carresi C; Gliozzi M; Musolino V; Maiuolo J; Palma E; Volterrani M; Mollace V; Muscoli C,International journal of molecular sciences,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39596298/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Implementing these interventions can contribute to a supportive environment for pregnant women, resulting in positive perinatal and neonatal outcomes. We summarize evidence for a total of twenty-seven interventions pertaining to ANC from Every Newborn Series published in The Lancet 2014 by identifying the most recent systematic reviews, extracting data from each review, and conducting a subgroup analysis for low-income and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) for outcomes relevant to maternal and neonatal health. Findings from our paper suggest a paucity in evidence from LMICs, and consolidated efforts are required to narrow this gap to build on more inclusive evidence on ANC. Evidence from LMICs suggests that antenatal multiple micronutrient supplementation when compared to iron and folic acid had a significant effect on stillbirth, small for gestational age, and low birthweight (LBW). Vitamin D supplementation reduced the risks of preterm birth and LBW. High-dose calcium supplementation, when compared to placebo in pregnancy, lowered the likelihood of developing high blood pressure, preeclampsia, and preterm birth. Antihypertensives significantly reduced the probability of developing severe hypertension, proteinuria/preeclampsia, and severe preeclampsia. Metformin for GDM reduced the risk of neonatal death or serious morbidity composite. Cervical cerclage had no effect on stillbirth, preterm birth, or perinatal and neonatal mortality.

39541789,Diabetes and the associated complications: The role of antioxidants in diabetes therapy and care.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia). Poorly managed diabetes can lead to complications affecting multiple organ systems. Antioxidants play a crucial role in reducing oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS), primarily triggered by uncontrolled high blood sugar levels in diabetes. Antioxidants like vitamin C, E, selenium, and alpha-lipoic acid, when used as supplements, have shown promise in reducing oxidative stress markers and improving antioxidant status in laboratory and animal studies and diabetic patients. Antioxidant supplementation may help reduce the risk of diabetic complications such as neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease. Additionally, antioxidants also have anti-inflammatory properties, which could be beneficial in reducing inflammation associated with diabetes. Antioxidant supplementation has been shown to enhance endothelial function, insulin sensitivity, and glucose metabolism, thereby aiding in glycemic control and overall diabetic management. Combining antioxidants with certain medications may have therapeutic benefits, such as effectively neutralizing free radicals and enhancing the regulation of antioxidant defense systems. This review presents an update on diabetes, the sources of free radical generation, the body's natural defense mechanisms, the clinical evidence regarding using antioxidants in managing diabetic complications, and the potential new therapeutic approaches. Overall, antioxidant supplementation may offer some benefits in managing diabetic complications. However, further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms of action, determine the optimal supplementation, explore potential interactions with other medications, and conduct long-term studies to establish the possible use of antioxidants for optimal benefits in diabetes care.",Dilworth L; Stennett D; Facey A; Omoruyi F; Mohansingh S; Omoruyi FO,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39541789/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39541030,Chromium supplementation and type 2 diabetes mellitus: an extensive systematic review.,"Diabetes is a global public health concern with increasing prevalence worldwide. Chromium (Cr), a trace element found in soil, water, and food, has been proposed to have a possible positive effect in glucose metabolism and diabetes mellitus prevention. However, the relationship between trivalent chromium [Cr(III)] exposure, mainly through the consumption of diet supplements, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains controversial. An extensive systematic review of the current literature on randomized controlled studies (RCTs) was conducted from 1 January 2000, to January 2024 using the databases PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane, with specific keywords and inclusion as well as exclusion criteria. After close screening of the research studies retrieved from the mentioned websites was conducted, the most related studies were included in the final systematic review. The studies were evaluated for the degree of relevance, quality, and risk bias, using appropriate quality assessment tools. Several of the included RCT studies reported possible benefits of Cr(III) supplementation, mainly in the form of chromium picolinate (CrPic), chromium yeast (CY), chromium chloride (CrCl<sub>3</sub>), and chromium nicotinate (CrN). The dosage of chromium was between 50 and 1000 μg/day and it was consumed from 2 to 6 months. Glycemic control markers, including FPG, insulin, HbA1C, and HOMA-IR levels, significantly decrease following chromium supplementation, mainly in studies with a longer intervention period. Supplementing with chromium (Cr) indicated that could significantly improve lipid profile by raising high-density lipoprotein and lowering triglyceride and total cholesterol while having little effect on low-density lipoprotein. However, most research findings include significant limitations, such as inconsistent dosage and type of chromium, formulation of supplements, and study duration. Further well-designed and high-quality research is needed to fully understand the role of chromium dietary supplementation and the potential risks related to its mechanisms of action, type, and dose, in the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.",Georgaki MN; Tsokkou S; Keramas A; Papamitsou T; Karachrysafi S; Kazakis N,Environmental geochemistry and health,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39541030/,0,1,0,0,0,0
39539878,Magnesium Matters: A Comprehensive Review of Its Vital Role in Health and Diseases.,"Magnesium (Mg), an essential mineral abundantly present within the human body, is intricately involved in a multitude of biochemical processes vital for maintaining health and overall well-being. This review aims to delve into the multifaceted impact of Mg on human health, exploring its physiological functions, dietary sources, and potential health implications of deficiency or insufficiency. Mg plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, including energy metabolism, muscle contraction, protein synthesis, and DNA synthesis. It acts as a cofactor for more than 300 enzymatic reactions, facilitating the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) for energy production. Moreover, Mg is essential for the proper functioning of ion channels, particularly calcium channels, influencing nerve transmission and muscle relaxation. Mg is naturally found in a wide array of foods, with green leafy vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and legumes being particularly rich sources. Additionally, certain fortified foods and dietary supplements provide supplemental Mg intake. Deficiency or insufficiency of mg can have profound implications for health. Inadequate mg levels have been associated with increased risks of various chronic diseases, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, mg deficiency may manifest as symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, tremors, and irregular heartbeat. Numerous studies have elucidated the relationship between mg intake and the risk of developing chronic diseases. For instance, epidemiological evidence suggests that higher mg intake is associated with a reduced risk of hypertension, possibly due to its vasodilatory effects and influence on blood pressure regulation mechanisms. Similarly, mg has been implicated in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes, with mg deficiency contributing to insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism. Furthermore, adequate mg intake is crucial for maintaining bone density and reducing the risk of osteoporosis, as mg plays a vital role in bone mineralization and bone health. Understanding the importance of mg in human physiology underscores the significance of ensuring adequate mg intake through diet or supplementation. Healthcare professionals play a critical role in educating individuals about the importance of incorporating mg-rich foods into their diets and considering mg supplementation when necessary, particularly for individuals at risk of deficiency or those with chronic diseases. Mg is an indispensable mineral with far-reaching implications for human health. Its involvement in various physiological processes underscores its importance in maintaining overall health and well-being. Ensuring adequate mg intake is essential for preventing deficiency-related health complications and reducing the risk of chronic diseases. Further research is warranted to elucidate the optimal strategies for mg supplementation and its potential therapeutic applications in disease prevention and management.",Fatima G; Dzupina A; B Alhmadi H; Magomedova A; Siddiqui Z; Mehdi A; Hadi N,Cureus,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39539878/,1,0,0,0,0,0

39522696,"An overview of the relationship between inflammation and cognitive function in humans, molecular pathways and the impact of nutraceuticals.","Inflammation has been associated with cognitive decline, whether in the peripheral or central nervous systems. The primary mechanism involves the response of microglia, an immune cell in the brain, which generates pro-inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. The excessive production of pro-inflammatory mediators may accelerate the damage to neurons, contributing to the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and vascular dementia, as well as a general decline in cognitive function. Various studies have supported the correlation between elevated pro-inflammatory mediators and a decline in cognitive function, particularly in aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, this association has also been observed in other inflammatory-related conditions, including post-operative cognitive impairment, diabetes, stroke, obesity, and cancer. However, the interaction between inflammatory processes and cognitive function in humans remains unclear and varies according to different health conditions. Therefore, this review aims to consolidate and evaluate the available evidence from original studies as well as meta-analyses in order to provide a greater understanding of the inflammatory process in connection with cognitive function in humans.

Myricetin, a flavonoid found in various plants, has shown potential anti-diabetic effects in murine studies. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the impact of myricetin supplementation on glucose metabolism and lipid profiles in mouse models of metabolic diseases. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO: CRD42024591569). Studies involving mice with metabolic disease models and exclusively using myricetin supplementation were checked across four databases (Embase, Scopus, PubMed, and WoS) until 23rd September 2024. The primary outcomes assessed were blood glucose (BG), insulin levels, triacylglycerol (TAG), total cholesterol (TC), HDL, and LDL. A random-effects model was applied to estimate standardized mean differences (SMD), and SYRCLE's risk-of-bias tool for animal studies was used. Twenty-one studies with 514 mice met the inclusion criteria. Myricetin supplementation significantly reduced BG (SMD = -1.45, CI: -1.91 to -0.99, <i>p</i> < 0.00001, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 74%), insulin (SMD = -1.78, CI: -2.89 to -0.68, <i>p</i> = 0.002, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 86%), TAG (SMD = -2.60, CI: -3.24 to -1.96, <i>p</i> < 0.00001, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 81%), TC (SMD = -1.86, CI: -2.29 to -1.44, <i>p</i> < 0.00001, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 62%), and LDL (SMD = -2.95, CI: -3.75 to -2.14, <i>p</i> < 0.00001, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 74%).

39519484,Vitamin D Supplementation: Shedding Light on the Role of the Sunshine Vitamin in the Prevention and Management of Type 2 Diabetes and Its Complications.,"As the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) continues to increase globally, researchers are keen to investigate various interventions to mitigate its impact. Among these, vitamin D supplementation has attracted significant attention due to its influence on insulin secretion from the pancreas and insulin receptors in body cells. A substantial body of evidence indicates that vitamin D supplementation can reduce low-grade inflammation, a critical factor in developing insulin resistance. In addition, vitamin D aids in sustaining low resting concentrations of reactive oxygen species and free radicals, normalizes Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, diminishes the expression of cytokines that are pro-inflammatory, and enhances the production of cytokines that are anti-inflammatory. This review discusses the effects of vitamin D on the glycemic control of individuals with T2DM and evaluates the impact of vitamin D supplementation on glycemic markers in this population. The investigation employs a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature with a special focus on recent studies published in the past decade. Based on the findings in the literature, it can be concluded that vitamin D supplementation alongside anti-diabetic medications may enhance glycemic control and potentially reduce the risk of diabetic complications. The evidence supports the notion that vitamin D supplementation can be a valuable addition to pharmacological agents for the management of T2DM, potentially enhancing glycemic control and overall health outcomes in affected individuals.",Vasdeki D; Tsamos G; Dimakakos E; Patriarcheas V; Koufakis T; Kotsa K; Cholewka A; Stanek A,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39519484/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39515560,The role for ω-3 polyunsaturated and short chain fatty acids in hypertension: An updated view on the interaction with gut microbiota.,"As of 2024, arterial hypertension is still considered the leading modifiable cardiovascular risk factor and, due to high rates of undertreatment and poor blood pressure control, the major contributor to human morbidity and mortality. Development of new treatment options and better interventions in lifestyle correction have become a priority of experimental and clinical research. In the last decades, dietary supplementation of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs) and generation of gut microbiota-derived short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have surged as potential and promising interventions for hypertension and cardiovascular prevention. ω-3 PUFAs are considered ""essential"" fatty acids that can be obtained only from dietary sources. Although previous intervention trials were not consistent in reporting a significant benefit of ω-3 PUFAs, the recent REDUCE-IT trial has provided robust evidence in support of their role in cardiovascular prevention. Recent studies have also identified the intestinal microbiota as a potential player in the pathophysiology and progression of hypertension. Although this might occur through many pathways, generation of SCFAs that is highly dependent on dietary fiber intake is primarily involved, providing an additional target for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. For these reasons, some scientific societies currently recommend dietary supplementation of ω-3 PUFAs and fiber-containing foods in patients with hypertension. In this narrative review, we summarize the results of studies that examined the effects of ω-3 PUFAs and SCFAs on blood pressure, highlighting the mechanisms of action on the vascular system and their possible impact on hypertension, hypertension-related organ damage and, ultimately, cardiovascular outcomes.",Brosolo G; Da Porto A; Marcante S; Capilupi F; Bertin N; Vivarelli C; Bulfone L; Vacca A; Catena C; Sechi LA,European journal of pharmacology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39515560/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39510448,Iodine and Hyperthyroidism: A Double-Edged Sword.,"This article serves as an update to a 1995 review by Braverman and Roti that was publishsed in the inaugural issue of Endocrine Practice. We searched PubMed for relevant English-language literature and identified additional papers cited in recent reviews. Iodine is a trace element found in the Earth's crust that is necessary for the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones. Excessive iodine exposure can lead to hyperthyroidism due to the failure of normal homeostatic mechanisms. Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism occurs most frequently in historically iodine-deficient regions, where there is an increased prevalence of autonomously functioning thyroid nodules, but this can also occur in regions with optimal background iodine intakes. Potential sources of iodine excess include iodized salt, seaweed, iodine-containing supplements, drinking water, iodinated contrast media, and amiodarone. In addition to being a potential cause of hyperthyroidism, inorganic iodine may be used to treat Graves' hyperthyroidism and thyroid storm, although there is a risk that this may worsen hyperthyroidism in some patients. Inorganic iodine is also used as a preoperative treatment to reduce thyroid vascularity before thyroidectomy. Recognizing potential sources of iodine and patients who may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of iodine excess can help to identify and prevent hyperthyroidism.",Braverman KD; Pearce EN,Endocrine practice : official journal of the American College of Endocrinology and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39510448/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39499092,Lack of Efficacy of Pomegranate Supplementation on Insulin Resistance and Sensitivity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"The objective of this study is to assess the impact of pomegranate supplements on insulin resistance (IR) and insulin sensitivity through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Additionally, we aim to analyze the differences in efficacy among various pomegranate extracts and the sensitivity of different diseases to pomegranate supplementation. We conducted searches in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library up to October 30, 2023, for relevant studies published in English. The treatment group required the intake of pomegranate extract for a minimum of 4 weeks, with no restrictions on the extract type. The control group received a placebo or a treatment excluding pomegranate extract. The primary outcome was homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and fasting insulin (FI), and the secondary outcome was quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI). RoB 2 was used to assess the risk of bias in the original studies. We pre-specified subgroup analyses based on types of intervention, intervention duration, health condition, and intervention dose. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to validate result stability, utilizing Begg's test and Egger's test for publication bias. Data synthesis and analysis were performed using Stata 15.1 software. This study included a total of 15 RCTs with 673 participants conducted in 7 countries. Risk of bias results indicated an overall low risk of bias of the articles. Participants included healthy individuals, overweight and obese individuals, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients, type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients, metabolic syndrome (MS) patients, and individuals with hyperlipidemia. Pomegranate extract variations included pomegranate juice (PJ), pomegranate seed oil (PSO) capsule, pomegranate/pomegranate peel (PP) extract capsule, and pomegranate peel-added bread. The control groups primarily received placebo treatments with varying dosage and frequency. No adverse reactions were reported in any of the studies. The summary results showed that compared to the control groups, pomegranate extract had no significant impact on improving HOMA-IR levels in participants (WMD = -0.03, 95%CI: -0.37 to 0.31, and p = 0.851) and FI (WMD = -0.03, 95%CI: -0.42 to 0.36, and p = 0.862). Additionally, there was no significant advantage of pomegranate extract on QUICKI changes in T2DM and PCOS patients (WMD = 0.00, 95%CI: 0.00 to 0.01, and p = 0.002). Subgroup analysis results indicated that pomegranate extract could improve HOMA-IR levels in PCOS patients (WMD = -0.42, 95%CI: -0.54 to -0.29, and p < 0.001) and FI levels in T2DM, PCOS, and NAFLD patients. Our results indicate that pomegranate extract only improves HOMA-IR and FI levels in PCOS patients and FI levels in T2DM and NAFLD patients. No significant difference has been found for HOMA-IR, FI, or QUICKI in other metabolic diseases. The current evidence suggests that we should interpret the value of pomegranate extract in regulating IR and sensitivity cautiously. In the future, there is a need for more rigorously designed RCTs to specifically evaluate the impact of pomegranate supplementation on insulin sensitivity in patients with NAFLD, PCOS, and T2DM.",Yin S; Zhu F; Zhou Q; Chen M; Wang X; Chen Q,Phytotherapy research : PTR,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39499092/,0,1,0,1,0,0
39481358,"DNA Methylation and Non-Coding RNAs in Metabolic Disorders: Epigenetic Role of Nutrients, Dietary Patterns, and Weight Loss Interventions for Precision Nutrition.","Dysregulation of epigenetic processes and abnormal epigenetic profiles are associated with various metabolic disorders. Nutrition, as an environmental factor, can induce epigenetic changes through both direct exposure and transgenerational inheritance, continuously altering gene expression and shaping the phenotype. Nutrients consumed through food or supplementation, such as vitamin B12, folate, vitamin B6, and choline, play a pivotal role in DNA methylation, a critical process for gene regulation. Additionally, there is mounting evidence that the expression of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) can be modulated by the intake of specific nutrients and natural compounds, thereby influencing processes involved in the onset and progression of metabolic diseases. Evidence suggests that dietary patterns, weight loss interventions, nutrients and nutritional bioactive compounds can modulate the expression of various microRNA (miRNAs) and DNA methylation levels, contributing to the development of metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, several studies have proposed that DNA methylation and miRNA expression could serve as biomarkers for the effects of weight loss programs. Despite ongoing debate regarding the effects of nutrient supplementation on DNA methylation levels and the expression of ncRNAs, certain DNA methylation marks and ncRNA expressions might predict the risk of metabolic disorders and act as biomarkers for forecasting the success of therapies within the framework of precision medicine and nutrition. The role of DNA methylation and miRNA expression as potential mediators of the effects of weight loss underscores their potential as biomarkers for the outcomes of weight loss programs. This highlights the influence of dietary patterns and weight loss interventions on the regulation of miRNA expression and DNA methylation levels, suggesting an interaction between these epigenetic factors and the body's response to weight loss.",Nicoletti CF; Assmann TS; Souza LL; Martinez JA,Lifestyle genomics,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39481358/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39474248,Impact of Vitamin E Supplementation on High-Density Lipoprotein in Patients With Haptoglobin Genotype-Stratified Diabetes: A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"<b>Background:</b> Vitamin E, an essential micronutrient with antioxidant potential, can dramatically reduce the cardiovascular risk in individuals with haptoglobin (Hp) 2-2 genotype diabetes; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. <b>Objective:</b> The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of vitamin E supplementation on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels and function in individuals with diabetes stratified by Hp genotype. <b>Methods:</b> All relevant studies published up to May 2023 were systematically reviewed using PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Chinese Wanfang, China Science and Technology Journal, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. Randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of vitamin E supplementation on HDL levels were included. The outcomes assessed were changes in HDL concentrations, cholesterol efflux, and HDL-associated lipid peroxides. <b>Results:</b> In total, 163 publications were selected. Based on inclusion and exclusion selection and quality assessment, five studies with 463 participants were included. Vitamin E supplementation did not exert any effect on HDL levels in individuals with diabetes with any Hp genotype. Three of the five studies revealed that vitamin E improved cholesterol efflux and HDL lipid peroxides in individuals with Hp2-2 diabetes but did not positively impact HDL function in Hp1 carriers. <b>Conclusions:</b> Although vitamin E supplementation did not significantly impact HDL levels in individuals with diabetes of any Hp genotype, it may improve HDL function in individuals with Hp2-2 diabetes. These findings indicate a pharmacogenetic interaction between vitamin E and the Hp genotype on HDL function. Moreover, vitamin E supplementation may be an effective strategy for specific individuals with diabetes.",Zheng PP; Zhang LW; Sheng D; Wang MZ; Li R; Zhao WL; Liu R; Xiu X; Zhao YS; Min X; Wang ZK; Liu ZC,Journal of diabetes research,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39474248/,0,1,0,0,0,0
39461896,The Effect of Algae Supplementation on Anthropometric Indices in Adults: A GRADE-Assessed Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"Inconsistent results have been reported regarding the effects of different types of algae, such as Spirulina and Chlorella, on anthropometric indices. To conduct a meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of algae supplementation on anthropometric indices. A comprehensive systematic search was conducted to find relevant articles published from January 1990 to January 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing algae supplementation with a placebo or control group were included. The risk of bias and certainty of the evidence were evaluated using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, respectively. The random-effects model was used to find the Weighted mean differences (WMDs) for each outcome. Of 9079 distinct articles in the initial screening, 61 clinical trials were included in this meta-analysis. Algae supplementation resulted in lower body mass index (WMD, -0.27 kg/m2 (95% CI, -0.42 to -0.13); GRADE rating, low), body weight (WMD: -0.78 kg [-1.18 to -0.38]; GRADE rating, low), waist circumference (WMD, -0.68 cm [-1.27 to -0.10]; GRADE rating, very low), kilograms of body fat (WMD, -0.65 kg [-1.13 to -0.17]; GRADE rating, low), and body fat percentage (WMD, -0.9% [-1.62 to -0.17]; GRADE rating, very low) compared with placebo or controls. Nevertheless, the statistically significant effects of algae supplementation on hip circumference (WMD, -0.20 cm [-0.73 to 0.32]; GRADE rating, moderate), waist to hip ratio (WMD, -0.01 [-0.01 to 0.00]; GRADE rating, moderate), and lean body mass (WMD, -0.30 kg [-0.62 to 0.02]; GRADE rating, moderate) were not observed. Overall, the findings of this meta-analysis indicate supplementation with algae may exert beneficial effects on anthropometric indices.

39458499,The Role of Dietary Ingredients and Herbs in the Prevention of Non-Communicable Chronic Liver Disease.,"Liver diseases are among the most commonly diagnosed conditions, with the main risk factors being inappropriate lifestyles, including poor diet, excessive alcohol consumption, low physical activity and smoking, including electronic cigarettes. Non-communicable chronic liver diseases also often develop as a result of accompanying overweight and obesity, as well as type 2 diabetes. The literature on risk factors for non-communicable chronic liver diseases, which show a high strong influence on their occurrence, was analysed. Measures to prevent non-communicable chronic liver disease include the selection of suitable food ingredients that have proven protective effects on the liver. Such ingredients include dietary fibre, probiotics, herbs, various types of polyphenols and fatty acids (omega-3). Because of their liver-protective effects, nutritionists recommend consuming vegetables, fruits, herbs and spices that provide valuable ingredients with anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects. These components should be provided with food and, in the case of probiotics, supplementation appears to be important. As a preventive measure, a diet rich in these nutrients is therefore recommended, as well as one that prevents overweight and other diseases that can result in liver disease.",Maćków M; Dziubyna T; Jamer T; Slivinskyi D; Pytrus T; Neubauer K; Zwolińska-Wcisło M; Stawarski A; Piotrowska E; Nowacki D,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39458499/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39428939,Impact of Melatonin Supplementation on Glycemic Parameters in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Several previous studies indicated that melatonin supplementation may positively affect glycemic control in patients with diabetes. However, research on the influence of melatonin supplementation on glycemic parameters remains inconclusive. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the impacts of melatonin supplementation on glycemic parameters in type 2 diabetes by conducting a meta-analysis. PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science were comprehensively searched until July 2024 to find eligible randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The overall effect sizes were estimated by using the randomeffect model and presented as weighted mean differences (WMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Furthermore, the heterogeneity among the included trials was assessed by performing the Cochran Q test and interpreted based on the I² statistic. Of the 1361 papers, eight eligible RCTs were included in this meta-analysis. Our findings indicated that melatonin supplementation significantly decreased fasting blood glucose (WMD = -12.65 mg/dl; 95% CI: -20.38, -4.92; P = 0.001), insulin (WMD = -2.30 μU/ml; 95% CI: -3.20, -1.40; P < 0.001), hemoglobin A1c (WMD = -0.79 %; 95% CI: -1.28, -0.29; P = 0.002), and HOMA-IR (WMD, -0.83; 95% CI: -1.59 to - 0.07; P = 0.03). According to the results of the current meta-analysis, persons with type 2 diabetes who supplement with melatonin had improved glycemic control. It looks that supplementing with melatonin at a dose exceeding 6 mg daily for over a period of 12 weeks may be more successful than other forms of intervention. Nevertheless, further research with larger sample sizes is necessary to draw definitive conclusions.",Abadi RNS; Jazinaki MS; Bahari H; Rashidmayvan M; Amini MR; Aliakbarian M; Khodashahi R; Malekahmadi M,Current pharmaceutical design,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39428939/,0,1,0,1,0,0

39408212,Influence of Type 2 Diabetes and Adipose Tissue Dysfunction on Breast Cancer and Potential Benefits from Nutraceuticals Inducible in Microalgae.,"Breast cancer (BC) represents the most prevalent cancer in women at any age after puberty. From a pathogenetic prospective, despite a wide array of risk factors being identified thus far, poor metabolic health is emerging as a putative risk factor for BC. In particular, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) provides a perfect example bridging the gap between poor metabolic health and BC risk. Indeed, T2DM is preceded by a status of hyperinsulinemia and is characterised by hyperglycaemia, with both factors representing potential contributors to BC onset and progression. Additionally, the aberrant secretome of the dysfunctional, hypertrophic adipocytes, typical of obesity, characterised by pro-inflammatory mediators, is a shared pathogenetic factor between T2DM and BC. In this review, we provide an overview on the effects of hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinemia, hallmarks of type 2 diabetes mellitus, on breast cancer risk, progression, treatment and prognosis. Furthermore, we dissect the role of the adipose-tissue-secreted adipokines as additional players in the pathogenesis of BC. Finally, we focus on microalgae as a novel superfood and a source of nutraceuticals able to mitigate BC risk by improving metabolic health and targeting cellular pathways, which are disrupted in the context of T2DM and obesity.",Sergi D; Melloni M; Passaro A; Neri LM,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39408212/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39387179,Overcoming challenges in the management of recurrent urinary tract infections.,"Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a major global health concern. While acute UTIs can usually be effectively treated, recurrent UTIs (rUTIs) impact patients for years, causing significant morbidity and can become refractory to front-line antibiotics. This review discusses the risk factors associated with rUTI, current rUTI treatment paradigms, prophylactic strategies, and challenges in rUTI diagnostics. We specifically discuss common risk factors for rUTI, including biological sex, age, menopause status, and diabetes mellitus. We also review recently available evidence for commonly used treatments, from oral antibiotic therapy to intravesical antimicrobials, electrofulguration of chronic cystitis, and the last-resort treatment, cystectomy. We discuss the most current literature evaluating prophylactic strategies for rUTI including long-term antibiotic prophylaxis, estrogen hormone therapy, and dietary supplements. Finally, we address the important role of UTI diagnostics in effective rUTI management and review the strengths and limitations of both current and emerging UTI diagnostic platforms as well as their ability to operate at point-of-care. We discuss the current challenges faced by clinicians in managing rUTI in women and the steps that should be taken so that clinicians, scientists, and patients can work together to better understand the disease and develop better strategies for its management.",Cornelius SA; Basu U; Zimmern PE; De Nisco NJ,Expert review of anti-infective therapy,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39387179/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Several studies have explored the role of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) serum levels, vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms, and vitamin D supplementation (VDS) in individuals with MS. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship of MS with 25(OH)D serum levels, VDR gene polymorphisms, and VDS. We assessed relevant articles published in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from the inception up to 24 February, 2024. Meta-analyses that investigated the link of 25(OH)D serum levels, VDR gene polymorphisms including Apal (rs7975232), BsmI (rs1544410), Taql (rs731236), and Fokl (rs10735810), and VDS with the risk and clinical manifestations of MS were included. The methodological quality of selected articles was assessed by the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews version 2. The statistical analysis of this umbrella review was carried out using RStudio version 2023.03.1 and R version 4.3.2, simultaneously. A total of 23 of 304 records were entered into this umbrella review with a pooled sample size of 37,567 participants. Eleven articles were rated as high quality, 1 was moderate quality, 1 was low quality, and 10 were critically low quality. The homozygote model of FokI (FF+ff compared with Ff) was significantly associated with an 8% reduction of MS risk (odds ratio: 0.92, 95% confidence interval: 0.86, 0.98; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%, P > 0.99). According to existing clinical evidence, the risk of MS may be associated with VDR gene polymorphism. Further studies are needed to explore the association of MS and vitamin D.

Inositols, a group of naturally occurring sugar alcohols, have gained attention for their potential benefits during pregnancy. This abstract provides a comprehensive review of the current literature on using inositols, primarily myo-inositol (MI) and D-chiro-inositol (DCI) in pregnancy. Inositols are crucial in cellular signal transduction and insulin sensitivity, making them integral to various physiological processes. Several studies suggest that inositols may contribute to preventing and managing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).

Part II.,"We have already published a review about the results of clinical trials evaluating the effects of selected nutraceuticals on glycemia in humans. In this second part, we describe the role of other nutraceuticals involved in dysglycemia. The available evidence showed promising hypoglycemic effects of the nutraceuticals reviewed both for their efficacy and safety profile. However, contradictory results as regard the efficacy of some supplements such as Allium sativum, Juglans regia, and Lycium barbarum on glucose homeostasis have emerged from some clinical studies. Other nutraceuticals including Aloe vera, Amorphophallus Konjac, Bauhinia forficata, Coccinia, Ganoderma lucidum, Ipomoea batatas, and Lupinus mutabilis require larger and long-term studies rigorously designed to confirm their hypoglycemic effects due to the scarce data available and the poor quality of clinical trials. Further studies are also required for Cinnamomum, Cynara scolymus, Momordica charantia, Olea europaea, and Opuntia streptacantha.

39357088,The effect of active vitamin D supplementation on body weight and composition: A meta-analysis of individual participant data.,"Obesity is associated with vitamin D (VitD) deficiency. However, previous studies showed mixed effects of VitD (25-hydroxyVitD/calcidiol) supplementation on body weight. The biological actions of VitD require the hydroxylation of inactive VitD into active VitD (1.25-dihydroxyVitD/calcitriol). This step is highly regulated; therefore, supplementing with inactive VitD might not be sufficient to overcome the potential adverse health effects of VitD deficiency. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of data acquired from randomised placebo-controlled calcitriol trials (RCTs) to determine the effects of calcitriol on body weight and weight-related parameters. Studies were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases up to January 27, 2024, and excluded those involving dialysis or cancer patients. We obtained IPD from eligible trials and assessed bias using the Cochrane Collaboration risk-of-bias tool and methodological quality using the Heyland Methodological Quality Score. The study was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017076202). Although none of the studies reported information regarding our primary objective, we obtained IPD for 411 patients, with 206 randomised to receive calcitriol and 205 to placebo. This dataset enabled us to conduct an IPD meta-analysis with 17,084 person-months of follow-up (median: 11 months). Meta-analysis showed that calcitriol does not alter body weight, BMI, waist circumference, fat mass or lean body mass compared to placebo. Adjusting for age and sex did not alter the outcomes. In conclusion, this systematic review and IPD meta-analysis indicate that calcitriol does not affect body weight in normal-weight postmenopausal women and lean patients with type 1 diabetes nor in people suffering from obesity, type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Whether calcitriol lowers body weight in VitD-sufficient people with obesity remains to be elucidated.",Oussaada SM; Akkermans I; Chohan S; Limpens J; Twisk JWR; Winkler C; Karalliedde J; Gallagher JC; Romijn JA; Serlie MJ; Ter Horst KW,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39357088/,0,1,0,1,0,1

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library for relevant studies. Serum 25(OH)D, fasting blood glucose (FBG), HbA1c, fasting insulin and Homeostasis Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) were analysed. We identified 39 randomized controlled trials involving 2982 subjects. Results showed a significant decline in the vitamin D group, as shown by the FBG weighted mean difference (WMD; -0.49 [95% confidence interval {CI}: -0.69 to -0.28] mmol/L), HbA1c (WMD -0.30% [95% CI: -0.43 to -0.18]), HOMA-IR (WMD -0.39 [95% CI -0.64 to -0.14]) and insulin (WMD -1.31 [95% CI: -2.06 to -0.56] μIU/mL). Subgroup analyses indicated that the effects of vitamin D supplementation on glycaemic control depend on the dosage and duration of supplementation, baseline 25(OH)D levels and the body mass index of patients with T2D. Vitamin D supplementation can significantly reduce serum FBG, HbA1c, HOMA-IR and fasting insulin levels in T2D patients; the effects were especially prominent when vitamin D was given in a short-term, high dosage to patients with a vitamin D deficiency, who were overweight, or had an HbA1c of 8% or higher at baseline.

Various approaches have been examined to improve glycemic control in patients with T2D. Modification of gut microbiome via administering probiotics has been extensively studied. The present study aims to sum up the existing literature which investigated the effect of probiotics on glycemic indices in individuals with T2D in the format of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Online medical databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) were searched from inception to January 2024. Eligible studies were included using pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Outcome variables included fasting blood sugar (FBS), insulin, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and homeostatic model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Weighted mean differences (WMDs) were estimated. Subgroup and dose-response analyses were conducted. P-values <0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Out of 5636 records retrieved by the initial search, thirty-two RCTs were included in the final analyses. Supplementation with probiotics was observed to significantly improve indices of glycemic control; including FBS (WMD: -13.27 mg/dl; 95 % CI: -18.31, -8.22), HbA1c (WMD: -0.44 %; 95 % CI: -0.59, -0.28), insulin (WMD: -1.33 μIU/ml; 95 % CI: -2.57, -0.08), and HOMA-IR (WMD: -0.95; 95 % CI: -1.71, -0.18). Dose-response analysis revealed that increased duration of intervention results in a larger reduction only in FBS. Supplementation with probiotics seems to improve indices of glycemic control.

39340710,Efficacy and safety of ketoanalogue supplementation combined with protein-restricted diets in advanced chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The benefits and harms of protein-restricted diets supplemented with ketoanalogues in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) remain uncertain. We aimed to evaluate the effects of ketoanalogues supplemented to protein-restricted diets in patients with advanced CKD. We conducted systematic literature searches of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library up to June 3, 2024. Randomized controlled trials comparing ketoanalogue supplementation with a low- or very low-protein diet versus a low-protein diet alone in stages 3-5 CKD patients were selected. Outcomes included glomerular filtration rate (GFR), end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), all-cause mortality, and blood levels of urea nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus, and albumin. Triceps skin fold, mid-arm muscle circumference, lean body mass, and subjective global assessment were also evaluated. The protocol for this systematic review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; registration number CRD42023465754). A total of 16 trials comprising 1344 participants were identified, with a median follow-up of 13 months. Compared to a low-protein diet alone, ketoanalogues supplemented to a protein-restricted diet resulted in a significantly higher GFR, decreased levels of urea nitrogen and phosphorus, and increased levels of calcium. Furthermore, ketoanalogues combined with a protein-restricted diet showed a marginally lower risk of ESKD in participants without diabetes. No significant differences were observed in all-cause mortality, albumin, mid-arm muscle circumference, lean body mass, and subjective global assessment. For stages 3-5 CKD patients, ketoanalogues combined with a protein-restricted diet may help postpone initiation of dialysis, improve calcium-phosphate homeostasis, and slow GFR decline, while maintaining a similar nutritional status and survival. Larger, long-term studies are needed to confirm these potential benefits, especially in CKD patients with diabetes.",Chen CH; Tsai PH; Tsai WC; Ko MJ; Hsu LY; Chien KL; Hung KY; Wu HY,Journal of nephrology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39340710/,0,1,0,1,0,1

39339785,Multifaceted Roles of Vitamin D for Diabetes: From Immunomodulatory Functions to Metabolic Regulations.,"Numerous studies have established associations between vitamin D and diabetes. The vitamin D receptor is widely distributed throughout the human body, including in pancreatic beta cells (β-cells), hepatocytes, and immune cells. Therefore, vitamin D's effect on the risk, progression, or complications of diabetes may be mediated through various mechanisms. These include the regulation of insulin secretion or sensitivity and modulation of β-cell function and its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. This review extensively explores the relationship between vitamin D status and diabetes, as well as the preventive or therapeutic effects of vitamin D supplementation on diabetes from human studies.

39339698,"Low-Protein Diets, Malnutrition, and Bone Metabolism in Chronic Kidney Disease.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has a high prevalence worldwide, with increasing incidence in low- and middle-income countries, and is associated with high morbidity and mortality, particularly from cardiovascular disease. Protein-restricted diets are one of the most widely used non-pharmacological approaches to slow the progression of CKD and prevent associated metabolic abnormalities. However, some concerns have been raised about the long-term safety of these diets, particularly with regard to patients' nutritional status and bone and mineral disorders. Therefore, the aim of this article is to review the most recent scientific evidence on the relevance of using protein-restricted diets (with or without keto-analogue supplementation) and, in particular, their relationships with malnutrition and mineral and bone disorders in people with CKD without kidney replacement therapies. Although protein-restricted diets, especially when supplemented with keto-analogues and highly personalized and monitored, do not appear to be associated with malnutrition, research on their effects on bone and mineral disorders is scarce, deserving further investigation.",Pereira CD; Guimarães C; Ribeiro VS; Vaz DC; Martins MJ,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39339698/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39327454,Effects of carotenoid supplementation on glycemic control: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials.,"We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of carotenoid supplementation on glycemic indices, and the certainty of evidence. A systematic literature search in PubMed, SCOPUS, ISI-Web of Science, and Cochrane Library was conducted from inception up to Jun 17, 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of carotenoid supplementation on circulating glycemic parameters were included. Records were excluded when studies reported the effect of co-interventions with other nutrients, did not provide mean differences (MDs) and standard deviations (SD) for outcomes, or administered whole food rather than supplements of carotenoids. Summary mean differences (MDs) and 95% CI between intervention and control groups were estimated using a random-effects model. The risk of bias of the included studies was assessed using the Risk of Bias 2.0 (RoB 2.0) tool. Overall, 36 publications with 45 estimated effect sizes were included in the meta-analyses. The overall findings showed an improvement in fasting blood glucose (FBG) (MD = -4.54 mg/dl; 95% CI: -5.9, -3.2; n = 45), and hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) (MD = -0.25% (95% CI: -0.4, -0.11; n = 22) in the intervention group in comparison with the control group. Moreover, in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D), interventions with astaxanthin and fucoxanthin led to a reduction in FBG by 4.36 mg/dl (95% CI: -6.13, -2.6; n = 10). The findings also showed that the intervention with crocin reduced FBG levels by 13.5 mg/dl (95% CI: -15.5, -7.8; n = 5), and HbA<sub>1C</sub> by 0.55% (95% CI: -0.77, -0.34; n = 5) in individuals with T2D. However, the certainty of evidence was very low. Carotenoid's supplementation improved glycemic parameters especially in people with T2D. However. the certainty of evidence was very low, mainly due to small sample size, and indirectness. Therefore, no specific recommendations can be provided at present and well-designed RCTs are required.

39302318,Prediabetes and insulin resistance: effect of vitamin D.,"The impact of vitamin D on improving insulin resistance in prediabetes remains controversial. The purpose of this review is to examine whether vitamin D supplementation improves insulin resistance in adults with prediabetes, and if so, to identify the mechanisms and the specific populations. Global prevalence of prediabetes is increasing, and prevention is a critical issue because these people with prediabetes will develop type 2 diabetes soon, which will put pressure on healthcare costs. Recent evidence on the effectiveness of vitamin D administration in improving insulin resistance and preventing the onset of type 2 diabetes in adults with prediabetes has been accumulating. The 2024 updated clinical practice guideline of the American Diabetes Association states that vitamin D administration to patients with prediabetes potentially benefits type 2 diabetes incidence in specific populations. There are also reports that vitamin D administration improves insulin resistance via increased serum osteocalcin levels, a marker of bone turnover. Vitamin D is likely to improve insulin resistance, which is already present at the time of prediabetes. However, the effectiveness may vary depending on ethnic differences and blood vitamin D levels at the start of administration.",Kawahara T,Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39302318/,1,0,0,0,0,0

39279596,Potential of Vitamin D and l-Cysteine Co-supplementation to Downregulate Mammalian Target of Rapamycin: A Novel Therapeutic Approach to Diabetes.,"Diabetes, a metabolic disease associated with an increased health care burden and mortality, is currently on the rise. Both upregulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and decreased levels of vitamin D (VD) and l-cysteine (LC) have been associated with diabetes. The overactivation of mTOR leads to insulin desensitization and metabolic dysfunction including uncontrolled hyperglycemia. This review summarizes various studies that have shown an inhibitory effect of VD or LC on mTOR activity. Findings from preclinical studies suggest that optimizing the VD and LC status in patients with diabetes can result in mTOR suppression, which has the potential to protect these individuals from microvascular and macrovascular complications while enhancing the regulation of their blood glucose. Given this information, finding ways to suppress mTOR signaling and also increasing VD and LC status is a possible therapeutic approach that might aid patients with diabetes. Future clinical trials are needed to investigate whether VD and LC co-supplementation can successfully downregulate mTOR and can be used as adjuvant therapy in patients with diabetes.",Stevens CM; Weeks K; Jain SK,Metabolic syndrome and related disorders,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39279596/,1,0,0,0,0,0

39275277,Role of Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Improving Metabolic Dysfunctions in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder that impacts women of reproductive age. In addition to reproductive and psychological complications, women with PCOS are also at a higher risk of developing metabolic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. While weight reduction can help manage these complications in overweight or obese women, many weight loss interventions have been ineffective due to weight stigma and its psychological impact on women with PCOS. Therefore, exploring alternative dietary strategies which do not focus on weight loss per se is of importance. In this regard, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids of marine origin (<i>n</i>-3 PUFAs), which are known for their hypotriglyceridemic, cardioprotective and anti-inflammatory effects, have emerged as a potential therapy for prevention and reversal of metabolic complications in PCOS. Several clinical trials showed that <i>n</i>-3 PUFAs can improve components of metabolic syndrome in women with PCOS. In this review, we first summarize the available clinical evidence for different dietary patterns in improving PCOS complications.

The PubMed, Web of Science, Science direct, Ebsco host, CNKI, WanFang, VIP, and CBM databases were electronically searched to collect randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the impact of vitamin D supplementation on DFUs from inception to 19 November 2022. Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. Meta-analysis was then performed by using RevMan 5.3 software. A total of seven studies involving 580 patients were included. The results of meta-analysis showed that compared with control group, the wound healing efficiency rate (RR = 1.42, 95%CI 1.03 to 1.95, P = 0.03) and wound reduction rate (MD = 13.11, 95%CI 4.65 to 21.56, P < 0.01) of the experimental group were higher; the change values of the wound area (MD = -3.29, 95%CI -4.89 to 1.70, P < 0.01) and 25 (OH) D (MD = 9.63, 95%CI 6.96 to 12.31, P < 0.01) were larger. Supplementation of vitamin D on DFU patients can improve glucose metabolism and insulin indexes: hemoglobin A1c (MD = -0.44, 95%CI -0.62 to -0.26, P < 0.01), fasting insulin (MD = -3.75, 95%CI -5.83 to -1.67, P < 0.01), HOMA - β (MD = -5.14, 95%CI -8.74 to -1.54, P < 0.01), and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (MD = 0.02, 95%CI 0.01 to 0.02, P < 0.01). It can also improve inflammation and oxidative stress markers: high sensitivity C-reactive protein (MD = -0.83, 95%CI -1.06 to -0.59, P < 0.01), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (MD = -15.74, 95%CI -21.78 to -9.71, P<0.01), nitric oxide (MD = 1.81, 95%CI 0.07 to 3.55, P = 0.04), and malondialdehyde (MD = -0.43, 95%CI -0.61 to -0.24, P<0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in changes of fasting plasma glucose, homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance, total antioxidant capacity, glutathione, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (P>0.05). The current evidence suggests that vitamin D supplementation can significantly promote DFU healing by lowering blood sugar and alleviating inflammation and oxidative stress. Key messages What is already known on this topic  Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a major complication of diabetes mellitus, with high morbidity, mortality and resource utilization. Vitamin D has the effect of lowering blood sugar, improving insulin sensitivity, and increasing anti-inflammatory response. Clinical research on vitamin D supplementation for the treatment of DFU is increasing, but due to the lack of combing and integration, the actual efficacy of vitamin D in patients is unclear. What this study adds  This meta-analysis has shown that vitamin D supplementation can significantly promote DFU healing by lowering blood glucose and alleviating inflammation and oxidative stress. How this study might affect research, practice or policy  This study preliminarily found the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation on the healing of DFU, which can provide a reference for the treatment of DFU by medical staff.",Wu X; Zeng J; Ye X; Peng M; Lan Y; Zhang S; Li H,Postgraduate medical journal,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39215492/,0,1,0,1,0,0
39195249,Zinc and Diabetes: A Connection between Micronutrient and Metabolism.,"Diabetes mellitus is a global health problem and a major contributor to mortality and morbidity. The management of this condition typically involves using oral antidiabetic medication, insulin, and appropriate dietary modifications, with a focus on macronutrient intake. However, several human studies have indicated that a deficiency in micronutrients, such as zinc, can be associated with insulin resistance as well as greater glucose intolerance. Zinc serves as a chemical messenger, acts as a cofactor to increase enzyme activity, and is involved in insulin formation, release, and storage. These diverse functions make zinc an important trace element for the regulation of blood glucose levels. Adequate zinc levels have also been shown to reduce the risk of developing diabetic complications. This review article explains the role of zinc in glucose metabolism and the effects of its inadequacy on the development, progression, and complications of diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, it describes the impact of zinc supplementation on preventing diabetes mellitus. The available information suggests that zinc has beneficial effects on the management of diabetic patients. Although additional large-scale randomized clinical trials are needed to establish zinc's clinical utility further, efforts should be made to increase awareness of its potential benefits on human health and disease.",Ahmad R; Shaju R; Atfi A; Razzaque MS,Cells,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39195249/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39194033,Effects of dietary supplementation in treatment and control of progression and complications of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: a systematic review with meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials.,"There is no safe and effective prevention for insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM) mellitus, which makes it highly dependent on its treatment. This systematic review with meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials investigated the overall effects of dietary supplements of vitamins, minerals, trace elements, and non-essential compounds with antioxidant properties, fatty acids, and amino acids in IDDM. Searches of MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, LILACS, The Grey Literature Report, and ClinicaTrials.gov, and citations from previous reviews were used to identify reports published through July 2023. The Risk of Bias 2 (RoB2) tool was used to analyze the risk of bias and GRADE was used to assess the quality of the results. Fifty-eight studies (n=3,044) were included in qualitative analyses and seventeen (n=723) in meta-analyses. Qualitative analyses showed few positive effects on some metabolic function markers, such as endothelial and renal function and lipid profile. Meta-analyses showed a positive effect of omega-3 on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (RMD=-0.33; 95%CI: -0.53, -0.12, P=0.002; I2=0%; GRADE: low quality; 4 studies) and of vitamin D on fasting C-peptide (FCP) (RMD=0.05; 95%CI: 0.01, 0.9, P=0.023; I2=0%; GRADE: very low quality; 4 studies). Most studies showed bias concern or high risk of bias. A recommendation for dietary supplementation in IDDM cannot be made because of the few positive results within different interventions and markers, the serious risk of bias in the included studies, and the low quality of evidence from meta-analyses. The positive result of vitamin D on FCP is preliminary, requiring further investigation.",Ferraz LC; Barros MDR; Almeida KMM; Silva MBG; Bueno NB,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39194033/,0,1,0,1,0,0

Systematic review of reports on corporal muscle mass from clinical trials that assessed the use of whey protein supplementation by means of validated techniques in patients with T2DM. PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, LILACS, and SciELO databases were searched up to April 2022. Risk of bias was assessed by the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool. We conducted a qualitative synthesis of information. Four studies (424 participants) that met the selection criteria were identified out of 1,787 records. Of these, 3 studies assessed the total muscle mass using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and 1 reported changes to the transverse diameter of the vastus lateralis muscle with ultrasound imaging. In the intervention groups, DXA assessments demonstrated an increase in total muscle mass in 3 studies and in the appendicular muscle mass in 2. Changes to the proportion of muscle mass were not seen in the DXA studies and only a discrete difference was seen in the comparative groups studied by ultrasound imaging. Following the administration of whey protein supplementation in patients with T2DM, a partially positive effect was seen in skeletal muscle mass gain with a moderate certainty of evidence.",López-Daza D; López-Ucrós N; Posada-Álvarez C; Savino-Lloreda P,"Endocrinologia, diabetes y nutricion",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39182982/,0,1,0,0,0,0

A systematic literature search up to December 2023 was completed in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, to identify eligible RCTs. Random effects models were assessed based on the heterogeneity tests, and pooled data were determined as weighted mean differences with a 95 % confidence interval. Finally, a total of 30 studies were found to be eligible for this meta-analysis. The pooled results using random effects model indicated that N. sativa supplementation significantly reduced FBS (SMD: -1.71; 95 % CI: -2.11, -1.31, p <0.001; I<sup>2</sup>= 92.7 %, p-heterogeneity <0.001) and HA1c levels (SMD: -2.16; 95 % CI: -3.04, -1.29, p <0.001; I<sup>2</sup>= 95.7 %, p-heterogeneity <0.001) but not effect on insulin (SMD = 0.48; 95 % CI: -0.53, 1.48, P = 0.353; I<sup>2</sup>= 96.1 %, p-heterogeneity <0.001), and HOMA-IR (SMD: -0.56; 95 % CI: -1.47, 0.35, p=0.229; I<sup>2</sup>= 95.0 %, p-heterogeneity <0.001).Overall, the evidence supports the consumption of N. sativa to reduce FBS and HA1c levels.

Ovid MEDLINE and Cochrane databases through May 24, 2023; surveillance through May 24, 2024. Randomized clinical trials of iron supplementation, screening effectiveness, treatment, and harms; observational studies of screening. Dual review of abstracts, full-text articles, study quality, and data abstraction. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. Maternal and infant clinical outcomes, hematologic indices, and harms. Seventeen trials (N = 24 023) on maternal iron supplementation were included. Iron supplementation was associated with decreased risk of maternal iron deficiency anemia at term (4 trials, n = 2230; 8.6% vs 19.8%; relative risk, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.26-0.61]; I2 = 20.5%) and maternal iron deficiency at term (6 trials, n = 2361; 46% vs 70%; relative risk, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.33-0.67]; I2 = 81.9%) compared with placebo or no iron supplement. There were no statistically significant differences in maternal quality of life, rates of gestational diabetes, maternal hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, cesarean delivery, preterm birth, infant low birth weight, or infants small for gestational age for maternal iron supplementation compared with placebo or no supplementation. Harms of iron supplementation included transient gastrointestinal adverse effects. No studies evaluated the benefits or harms of screening for iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy. Data on the association between iron status and health outcomes, such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and preterm birth, were very limited. Routine prenatal iron supplementation reduces the incidence of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy, but evidence on health outcomes is limited or indicates no benefit. No studies addressed screening for iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy.

39143432,Nigella sativa L. and its bioactive and nutraceutical components in the management of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.,"Diabetes-induced hyperglycemia leads to excessive production of oxygen free radicals, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress, which initiates diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Currently, this condition affects 20% of adults with diabetes. Despite significant advances in the treatment of diabetes, the incidence of its complications, including DPN, is still high. Thus, there is a growing research interest in developing more effective and treatment approaches with less side effects for diabetes and its complications. Nigella sativa L. (NS) has received much research attention as an antioxidant, anti-yperglycemic factor, and anti-inflammatory agent. This natural compound demonstrates its antidiabetic neuropathy effect through various pathways, including the reduction of lipid peroxidation, the enhancement of catalase and superoxide dismutase enzyme activity, and the decrease in inflammatory cytokine levels. The present review focuses on the bioactive and nutraceutical components of black cumin (Nigella sativa L.) and their effects on DPN. In addition, we have also summarized the findings obtained from several experimental and clinical studies regarding the antidiabetic neuropathy effect of NS in animal models and human subjects.",Khodaie SA; Razavi R; Nikkhah H; Namiranian N; Kamalinejad M,Inflammopharmacology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39143432/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39125420,"Daily and Weekly ""High Doses"" of Cholecalciferol for the Prevention and Treatment of Vitamin D Deficiency for Obese or Multi-Morbidity and Multi-Treatment Patients Requiring Multi-Drugs-A Narrative Review.","Daily vitamin D supplementation using higher than normal dosing (up to the upper limit value) and intermittent (once or twice per week) dosing were studied in patients with increased risk of vitamin D deficiency. Using a PubMed database, a thorough search for published randomized controlled trials and other studies was conducted, and the results were analyzed. This review provides an overview of the use of 7000 IU daily, 30,000 IU per week or twice weekly, and 50,000 IU weekly of vitamin D for obtaining and maintaining 25(OH)D concentrations of at least 30 ng/mL in patients at high risk of vitamin D deficiency. The abovementioned dosages should be considered in adults with obesity, liver disease or malabsorption syndromes, or multi-diseased patients, mainly seniors requiring multi-drug treatment, including drugs affecting vitamin D metabolism. The simple schedules of 7000 IU/day, 30,000 IU/week or twice weekly, and 50,000 IU/week for use by patients with an increased risk of vitamin D deficiency were provided for consideration. Without monitoring of 25(OH)D, daily doses of 7000 IU or intermittent doses of 30,000 IU/week should be considered for a prolonged time as prophylactic or maintenance doses, mainly in obese patients, patients with liver disease and patients with malabsorption syndromes. For the treatment of possible vitamin D deficiency without assessment of 25(OH)D in these groups, intermittent doses of 30,000 IU twice weekly or 50,000 IU per week should be considered for a 6-8-week period only. The higher daily doses or the intermittent doses suggested above are effective, safe and responsive based on patient's preferences.",Pludowski P; Marcinowska-Suchowierska E; Togizbayev G; Belaya Z; Grant WB; Pilz S; Holick MF,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39125420/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39115013,Influence of myo-inositol on metabolic status for gestational diabetes: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"The efficacy of myo-inositol supplementation to treat gestational diabetes remains controversial, and this meta-analysis aims to study the efficacy of myo-inositol supplementation on metabolic status for gestational diabetes. Several databases including PubMed, EMbase, Web of science, EBSCO, and Cochrane library databases were systemically searched from inception to October 2021, and we included the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of myo-inositol supplementation on the outcomes of women with gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes was diagnosed if at least one threshold of glucose concentration was exceeded and the three thresholds included 92, 180, and 153 mg/dl for 0, 1 and 2 h, respectively, after a 75-g, 2-h glucose tolerance test. Four RCTs and 317 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with routine treatment in pregnant women with gestational diabetes, myo-inositol supplementation could lead to remarkably decreased treatment requirement with insulin (odd ratio [OR] = 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.11-0.52; <i>p</i> = .0003) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, standard mean difference [SMD]= -1.18; 95% CI= -1.50 to -0.87; <i>p</i> < .00001), but demonstrated no obvious impact on birth weight (SMD= -0.11; 95% CI= -0.83 to 0.61 g; <i>p</i> = .76), cesarean section (OR = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.46-1.47; <i>p</i> = .51) or the need of NICU (OR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.03-26.57; <i>p</i> = .94).

This study aimed to update the findings of the previous systematic review evidence regarding the effect of melatonin on factors related to IR, including hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI). We systematically reviewed the evidence on the impact of melatonin supplementation on IR indices, fasting insulin, and fasting plasma glucose. PubMed, ScienceDirect, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar databases were searched until March 2024. We identified 6114 potentially relevant articles during the search. Eighteen animal studies and 15 randomized clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. The results indicated that melatonin supplementation reduced fasting plasma glucose (FPG, 14 out of 29 studies), fasting insulin (22 out of 28 studies), HOMA-IR (28 out of 33 studies), and increased QUICKI (7 out of 7 studies). According to RCT studies, melatonin treatment at a dosage of 10 mg reduced HOMA-IR levels in individuals with various health conditions.

39077939,Vitamin D supplementation for women during pregnancy.,"Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy may help improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes (such as fewer preterm birth and low birthweight babies) and reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (such as severe postpartum haemorrhage). To examine whether vitamin D supplementation alone or in combination with calcium or other vitamins and minerals given to women during pregnancy can safely improve certain maternal and neonatal outcomes. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Trials Register (which includes results of comprehensive searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and relevant conference proceedings) (3 December 2022). We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies. Randomised and quasi-randomised trials evaluating the effect of supplementation with vitamin D alone or in combination with other micronutrients for women during pregnancy in comparison to placebo or no intervention. Two review authors independently i) assessed the eligibility of studies against the inclusion criteria, ii) assessed trustworthiness based on pre-defined criteria of scientific integrity, iii) extracted data from included studies, and iv) assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. The previous version of this review included 30 studies; in this update, we have removed 20 of these studies to 'awaiting classification' following assessments of trustworthiness, one study has been excluded, and one new study included. This current review has a total of 10 included studies, 117 excluded studies, 34 studies in awaiting assessment, and seven ongoing studies. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. This removal of the studies resulted in evidence that was downgraded to low-certainty or very low-certainty due to study design limitations, inconsistency between studies, and imprecision. Supplementation with vitamin D compared to no intervention or a placebo A total of eight studies involving 2313 pregnant women were included in this comparison. We assessed four studies as having a low risk of bias for most domains and four studies as having high risk or unclear risk of bias for most domains. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of supplementation with vitamin D during pregnancy compared to placebo or no intervention on pre-eclampsia (risk ratio (RR) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 1.33; 1 study, 165 women), gestational diabetes (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.03 to 8.28; 1 study, 165 women), preterm birth (< 37 weeks) (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.33; 3 studies, 1368 women), nephritic syndrome (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.06; 1 study, 135 women), or hypercalcaemia (1 study; no cases reported). Supplementation with vitamin D during pregnancy may reduce the risk of severe postpartum haemorrhage; however, only one study reported this outcome (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.91; 1 study, 1134 women; low-certainty evidence) and may reduce the risk of low birthweight; however, the upper CI suggests that an increase in risk cannot be ruled out (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.08; 3 studies, 371 infants; low-certainty evidence). Supplementation with vitamin D + calcium compared to no intervention or a placebo One study involving 84 pregnant women was included in this comparison. Overall, this study was at moderate to high risk of bias. Pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and maternal adverse events were not reported. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of supplementation with vitamin D and calcium on preterm birth (RR not estimable; very low-certainty evidence) or for low birthweight (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.14 to 14.94; very low-certainty evidence) compared to women who received placebo or no intervention. Supplementation with vitamin D + calcium + other vitamins and minerals versus calcium + other vitamins and minerals (but no vitamin D) One study involving 1298 pregnant women was included in this comparison. We assessed this study as having a low risk of bias in all domains. Pre-eclampsia was not reported. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of supplementation with vitamin D, calcium, and other vitamins and minerals during pregnancy compared to no vitamin D on gestational diabetes (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.73; very low-certainty evidence), maternal adverse events (hypercalcaemia no events and hypercalciuria RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.02 to 3.97; very low-certainty evidence), preterm birth (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.59; low-certainty evidence), or low birthweight (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.51; low-certainty evidence). This updated review using the trustworthy assessment tool removed 21 studies from the previous update and added one new study for a total of 10 included studies. In this setting, supplementation with vitamin D alone compared to no intervention or a placebo resulted in very uncertain evidence on pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, or nephritic syndrome. It may reduce the risk of severe postpartum haemorrhage; however, only one study reported this outcome. It may also reduce the risk of low birthweight; however, the upper CI suggests that an increase in risk cannot be ruled out. Supplementation with vitamin D and calcium versus placebo or no intervention resulted in very uncertain evidence on preterm birth and low birthweight. Pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and maternal adverse events were not reported in the only study included in this comparison. Supplementation with vitamin D + calcium + other vitamins and minerals versus calcium + other vitamins and minerals (but no vitamin D) resulted in very uncertain evidence on gestational diabetes and maternal adverse events (hypercalciuria) and uncertain evidence on preterm birth and low birthweight. Pre-eclampsia was not reported in the only study included in this comparison. All findings warrant further research.

39074164,Effects of Sesamin in Animal Models of Obesity-Associated Diseases: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"As living standards have improved and lifestyles have undergone changes, metabolic diseases associated with obesity have become increasingly prevalent. It is well established that sesamin (Ses) (PubChem CID: 72307), the primary lignans in sesame seeds and sesame oil, possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of Ses on animal models of obesity-related diseases was performed to assess their impact on relevant disease parameters. Importantly, this study sought to provide insights for the design of future human clinical studies utilizing Ses as a nutritional supplement or drug. This study conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library, identifying English language articles published from inception to April 2023. The search incorporated keywords such as ""sesamin,"" ""obesity,"" ""non-alcoholic fatty liver disease,"" ""type 2 diabetes mellitus,"" and ""metabolic syndrome."" The meta-analysis included 17 articles on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Overall, the pooled results demonstrated that Ses significantly reduced levels of total serum cholesterol (P = .010), total serum triglycerides (P = .003), alanine transaminase (P = .003), and blood glucose (P < .001), and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (P = .012) in animal models of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In the type 2 diabetes model, Ses mitigated drug-induced weight loss (P < .001), high-fat-diet-induced weight gain (P < .001), and blood glucose levels (P = .001). In the metabolic syndrome model, Ses was associated with a significant reduction in body weight (P < .001), total serum cholesterol (P < .001), total serum triglycerides (P < .001), blood glucose (P < .001), and alanine transaminase levels (P = .039). The meta-analysis results of this study suggest that Ses supplementation yields favorable effects in animal models of obesity-related diseases, including hypolipidemic, insulin-lowering, and hypoglycemic abilities, as well as organ protection from oxidative stress and reduced inflammation.

39053698,Effects of melatonin supplementation on markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in patients with diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder, in which chronic systemic inflammation and oxidative stress contribute to the progression of this condition and its complications. Melatonin, a hormone known for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, has emerged as a potential therapeutic intervention in diabetes. This review aims to evaluate the effects of melatonin supplementation on markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in diabetic patients. A thorough literature search of databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central, CNKI, and Scopus, was conducted through October 2023. We included randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of melatonin on markers of inflammation and oxidative stress, compared to placebo in patients with diabetes. The data was analyzed using the random-effects model and the summary effect size was determined using the standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Fourteen studies with 823 participants were included. Our analysis indicates that melatonin can lead to significant reductions in levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) [SMD = -0.75; 95% CI: -1.37, -0.12; P = 0.018], tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) [SMD = -0.40; 95% CI: -0.64, -0.15; P = 0.001], interleukin (IL)-1 [SMD = -0.75; 95% CI: -1.03, -0.47; P < 0.0001], IL-6 [SMD = -0.79; 95% CI: -1.07, -0.51; P < 0.0001], and malondialdehyde (MDA) [SMD = -0.61; 95% CI: -0.80, -0.43; P < 0.0001].

39053695,The effect of oral supplementation of ginger on glycemic control of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus - A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Ginger, a root originating in Southeast Asia, has several therapeutic benefits to human health, including antioxidant activity. Currently, there are discussions regarding the hypoglycemic properties of dietary supplements derived from its phenolic compounds in the management of chronic diseases. Diabetes mellitus is a chronic and complex disease that requires continuous treatment, with glycemic control being decisive in the management of hyperglycemia. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify the effects of oral supplementation of ginger in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in patients undergoing randomized clinical trial studies. Across the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, randomized controlled trials that examined the role of ginger in T2DM until January 2022 were systematically researched. The parameters used to assess T2DM treatment control were Fasting Blood Glucose (FBS) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Bias risk assessment of the studies was performed using the RoB 2.0 tool. Meta-analysis was performed considering data compatibility. Five studies were included in the analysis. Capsules containing Zingiber officinale powder were supplemented twice a day. The dose ranged from 1.2 to 2g/day, and the intervention period ranged from 4 to 12 weeks. Meta-analysis results indicated no significant effect of ginger supplementation on FBS or HbA1c. However, individual studies reported mixed results, with two studies showing a significant reduction in FBS. This suggests that while ginger may have potential as an adjuvant therapy, its overall impact on glycemic control in T2DM is not statistically significant when results are pooled. Currently published articles are still limited, requiring further studies of high methodological quality to verify the effectiveness of ginger supplementation on T2DM parameters control.",Schumacher JC; Mueller V; Sousa C; Peres KK; da Mata IR; Menezes RCR; Dal Bosco SM,Clinical nutrition ESPEN,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39053695/,0,1,0,1,0,0
39031306,The Role of Omega- 3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Diabetes Mellitus Management: A Narrative Review.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a group of metabolic illnesses characterized by elevated levels of glucose in the bloodstream as a result of abnormalities in the generation or function of insulin. Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) is an essential component of diabetes management. Dietary fats are essential in both the prevention and progression of chronic diseases. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are recognized for their advantageous impact on health. They assist in controlling blood sugar levels and lipid profile in patients with all types of diabetes. Furthermore, they reduce the occurrence of cardiovascular events and death linked to DM. After evaluating the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antilipidemic, and antidiabetic mechanisms of omega-3 fatty acid supplements, as well as the results from randomized controlled studies, it is clear that these supplements have positive effects in both preventing and treating diabetes, as well as preventing and treating complications related to diabetes, specifically cardiovascular diseases. However, current evidence does not support the use of omega-3 supplementation in people with diabetes for the purpose of preventing or treating cardiovascular events. People with all types of diabetes are suggested to include fatty fish and foods high in omega-3 fatty acids in their diet twice a week, as is prescribed for the general population.",Bayram SŞ; Kızıltan G,Current nutrition reports,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39031306/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39009925,Inositols and female reproduction disorders: a consensus statement from the working group of the Club of the Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE)-Women's Endocrinology.,"To provide the latest scientific knowledge on the efficacy of inositols for improving reproductive disorders in women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and to reach a consensus on their potential use through a Delphi-like process. A panel of 17 endocrinologists and 1 gynecologist discussed 4 key domains: menses irregularity and anovulation, fertility, pregnancy outcomes, and neonatal outcomes. A total of eight consensus statements were drafted. Myo-inositol (Myo) supplementation can be used to improve menses irregularities and anovulation in PCOS. Myo supplementation can be used in subfertile women with or without PCOS to reduce the dose of r-FSH for ovarian stimulation during IVF, but it should not be used to increase the clinical pregnancy rate or live birth rate. Myo supplementation can be used in the primary prevention of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), but should not be used to improve pregnancy outcomes in women with GDM. Myo can be preconceptionally added to folic acid in women with a previous neural tube defects (NTD)-complicated pregnancy to reduce the risk of NTDs in newborns. Myo can be used during pregnancy to reduce the risk of macrosomia and neonatal hypoglycemia in mothers at risk of GDM. This consensus statement provides recommendations aimed at guiding healthcare practitioners in the use of inositols for the treatment or prevention of female reproductive disorders. More evidence-based data are needed to definitively establish the usefulness of Myo, the appropriate dosage, and to support the use of D-chiro-inositol (DCI) or a definitive Myo/DCI ratio.",Moretti C; Bonomi M; Dionese P; Federici S; Fulghesu AM; Giannelli J; Giordano R; Guccione L; Maseroli E; Moghetti P; Mioni R; Pivonello R; Sabbadin C; Scaroni C; Tonacchera M; Verde N; Vignozzi L; Gambineri A,Journal of endocrinological investigation,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39009925/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38999752,The Impact of Vitamin D and L-Cysteine Co-Supplementation on Upregulating Glutathione and Vitamin D-Metabolizing Genes and in the Treatment of Circulating 25-Hydroxy Vitamin D Deficiency.,"Vitamin D receptors are expressed in many organs and tissues, which suggests that vitamin D (VD) affects physiological functions beyond its role in maintaining bone health. Deficiency or inadequacy of 25(OH)VD is widespread globally. Population studies demonstrate that a positive association exists between a high incidence of VD deficiency and a high incidence of chronic diseases, including dementia, diabetes, and heart disease. However, many subjects have difficulty achieving the required circulating levels of 25(OH)VD even after high-dose VD supplementation, and randomized controlled clinical trials have reported limited therapeutic success post-VD supplementation. Thus, there is a discordance between the benefits of VD supplementation and the prevention of chronic diseases in those with VD deficiency. Why this dissociation exists is currently under debate and is of significant public interest. This review discusses the downregulation of VD-metabolizing genes needed to convert consumed VD into 25(OH)VD to enable its metabolic action exhibited by subjects with metabolic syndrome, obesity, and other chronic diseases. Research findings indicate a positive correlation between the levels of 25(OH)VD and glutathione (GSH) in both healthy and diabetic individuals. Cell culture and animal experiments reveal a novel mechanism through which the status of GSH can positively impact the expression of VD metabolism genes. This review highlights that for better success, VD deficiency needs to be corrected at multiple levels: (i) VD supplements and/or VD-rich foods need to be consumed to provide adequate VD, and (ii) the body needs to be able to upregulate VD-metabolizing genes to convert VD into 25(OH)VD and then to 1,25(OH)2VD to enhance its metabolic action. This review outlines the association between 25(OH)VD deficiency/inadequacy and decreased GSH levels, highlighting the positive impact of combined VD+LC supplementation on upregulating GSH, VD-metabolizing genes, and VDR. These effects have the potential to enhance 25(OH)VD levels and its therapeutic efficacy.",Jain SK; Justin Margret J; Abrams SA; Levine SN; Bhusal K,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38999752/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38992391,"Effects of vitamin D supplementation on metabolic syndrome parameters in patients with obesity or diabetes in Brazil, Europe, and the United States: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","Plasma 25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels appear reduced in patients with obesity or type 2 diabetes, as reported in several observational studies. However, the association between these reduced hormone levels and metabolic parameters is unclear. In any case, vitamin D supplementation in patients with Metabolic Syndrome is standard. Still, the impacts of this supplementation on conditions such as glycemia, blood pressure, and lipidemia are debatable. Based on this question, we carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials in Brazil, Europe, and the United States that analyzed the effects of vitamin D supplementation on Metabolic Syndrome parameters in patients with obesity or type 2 diabetes. Our search yielded 519 articles and included 12 randomized controlled trials in the meta-analysis. Vitamin D supplementation had no effect on any of the outcomes analyzed (fasting blood glucose and insulinemia, glycated hemoglobin, HOMA index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, weight, waist circumference, total cholesterol, LDL and HDL, and triglycerides). However, subgroup analyses indicated that using vitamin D up to 2000 IU daily reduced participants' fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin. Furthermore, the intervention reduced diastolic blood pressure only in participants with vitamin D deficiency. At least two studies showed a high risk of bias using the Rob2 protocol. According to the GRADE protocol, the evidence quality varied from moderate to very low. These results indicate that vitamin D supplementation does not improve patients' metabolic parameters and that the association between plasma 25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels and Metabolic Syndrome may not be causal but caused by other confounding characteristics. However, in any case, the quality of evidence is still low, and more randomized clinical trials are essential to clarify these relationships.",Oliveira INN; Macedo-Silva A; Coutinho-Cruz L; Sanchez-Almeida J; Tavares MPS; Majerowicz D,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38992391/,0,1,0,1,0,0
38987876,Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> Status and Supplementation in Plant-Based Diets.,"Plant-based diets are increasingly popular worldwide. A well-planned plant-based diet lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and certain cancers. In contrast, a poorly planned plant-based diet increases the risk of certain micronutrient deficiencies, chiefly, vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (B<sub>12</sub>). Because B<sub>12</sub> is not present in plants or in unfortified plant-based foodstuffs, the safest way to prevent its deficiency in plant-based diets is to take an oral B<sub>12</sub> supplement. Studies determining the dose and frequency of B<sub>12</sub> to be taken by healthy individuals on a plant-based diet to support an adequate B<sub>12</sub> status are scarce. Here, we summarize the natural sources, metabolic requirements, biomarker findings with and without supplementation with B<sub>12</sub>, and current recommendations to help prevent vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency in healthy individuals adhering or transitioning to plant-based diets. This review focuses on the prevention of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency in healthy individuals adhering to plant-based diets. The information covered in this review does not apply to individuals suffering from autoimmune-based malabsorption of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> resulting from pernicious anemia due to atrophic gastritis, other acquired causes of B<sub>12</sub> malabsorption or to those with genetic disorders that impair vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorption, transport and utilization.",Hannibal L; Lederer AK; Storz MA; Huber R; Jacobsen DW,Food and nutrition bulletin,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38987876/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38980796,Role of Omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) as modulatory and anti-inflammatory agents in noncommunicable diet-related diseases - Reports from the last 10 years.,"Fatty acids are a fundamental component of the human diet, particularly polyunsaturated fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The importance of omega-3 fatty acids has been studied in the context of many diseases due to their pleiotropic effects, focusing on the anti-inflammatory effects of EPA and DHA. Currently, the results of these acids in noncommunicable diseases are being increasingly assessed in a broader context than just inflammation. However, the mechanisms underlying the modulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3 fatty acids remain the subject of intensive research. Therefore, we reviewed the literature covering articles from the last decade to assess not only the anti-inflammatory but, above all, the modulatory effect of EPA and DHA acids on noncommunicable diet-related diseases. The PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases were searched for studies regarding the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on diet-related disorders from the last 10 years. The available research shows that EPA and DHA supplementation has a beneficial impact on regulating triglycerides, total cholesterol, insulin resistance, blood pressure, liver enzymes, inflammatory markers and oxidative stress. Additionally, there is evidence of their potential benefits in terms of mitochondrial function, regulation of plasma lipoproteins, and reduction of the risk of sudden cardiovascular events associated with atherosclerotic plaque rupture. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (EPA, DHA) have many beneficial effects among patients with diet-related disorders. More well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed to fully determine the usefulness of EPA and DHA in treating and preventing noncommunicable diet-related diseases.",Banaszak M; Dobrzyńska M; Kawka A; Górna I; Woźniak D; Przysławski J; Drzymała-Czyż S,Clinical nutrition ESPEN,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38980796/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38978922,The Role of Alternative Medicine in Managing Type 2 Diabetes: A Comprehensive Review.,"Diabetes, a chronic metabolic disorder marked by elevated blood glucose levels, is increasingly prevalent globally, significantly impacting health-related quality of life. Type 2 diabetes (T2DM), characterized by insulin resistance and inadequate insulin production, presents a substantial public health challenge, necessitating comprehensive management strategies. Conventional treatments, including lifestyle modifications and pharmacotherapy, are essential for glycemic control and preventing complications. However, adherence to these treatments is often limited, highlighting the need for alternative strategies. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) offers potential cost-effective and accessible approaches for managing T2DM. Key herbal remedies like cinnamon, fenugreek, and bitter melon, along with dietary supplements like chromium, magnesium, and vanadium, have shown promise in glycemic control. Mind-body therapies, including yoga, tai chi, and meditation, contribute to improved hemoglobin A1c and fasting blood glucose levels. Research supports the integration of CAM with conventional therapies, demonstrating enhanced clinical efficacy and reduced economic burden. However, challenges such as standardization, quality control, and potential risks of herbal medicines need careful consideration. Regulatory frameworks and ethical considerations are essential to ensure patient safety and informed decision-making. Patient education and effective communication between healthcare providers and patients are crucial for integrating CAM into diabetes management. Empowerment-based interventions and collaborative approaches can enhance self-management skills and clinical outcomes. Overall, integrating CAM with conventional treatments offers a holistic approach to managing T2DM, potentially improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.",McBenedict B; Orfao AL; Goh KS; Yau RCC; Alphonse B; Machado Lima J; Ahmed HA; Ienaco GP; Cristina de Souza E; Lima Pessôa B; Hauwanga WN; Valentim G; de Souza Chagas M; Abrahão A,Cureus,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38978922/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38951907,Nonpharmacological interventions on glycated haemoglobin in youth with type 1 diabetes: a Bayesian network meta-analysis.,"The available evidence on the impact of specific non-pharmacological interventions on glycaemic control is currently limited. Consequently, there is a need to determine which interventions could provide the most significant benefits for the metabolic health of young individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to identify optimal nonpharmacological interventions on glycaemic control, measured by glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Systematic searches were conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and SPORTDiscus from inception to July 1, 2023. Randomised clinical trials (RCT) investigating nonpharmacological interventions (e.g., physical activity, nutrition, and behavioural therapies) were included. Primary outcome was change in HbA1c levels. Secondary outcome was change in daily insulin dose requirement. Seventy-four RCT with 6,815 participants (49.43% girls) involving 20 interventions were analysed using a network meta-analysis. Most interventions showed greater efficacy than standard care. However, multicomponent exercise, which includes aerobic and strength training (n = 214, standardised mean difference [SMD] =- 0.63, 95% credible interval [95% CrI] - 1.09 to - 0.16) and nutritional supplements (n = 146, SMD =- 0.49, - 0 .92 to - 0.07) demonstrated the greatest HbA1c reductions. These interventions also led to the larger decreases in daily insulin needs (n = 119, SMD =- 0.79, 95% CrI -  1.19 to - 0.34) and (n = 57, SMD =- 0.62, 95% CrI -  1.18 to - 0.12, respectively). The current study underscores non-pharmacological options such as multicomponent exercise and nutritional supplements, showcasing their potential to significantly improve HbA1c in youth with type 1 diabetes. Although additional research to confirm their efficacy is required, these approaches could be considered as potential adjuvant therapeutic options in the management of type 1 diabetes among children and adolescents.",Muñoz-Pardeza J; López-Gil JF; Huerta-Uribe N; Hormazábal-Aguayo I; Izquierdo M; García-Hermoso A,Cardiovascular diabetology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38951907/,0,1,0,0,0,0

Update a 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effect of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy, identify sources of heterogeneity between trials, and describe evidence gaps precluding a clinical recommendation. The MEDLINE, PubMed, Europe PMC, Scopus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases were searched. Articles were included that reported on RCTs that included pregnant women given vitamin D supplements as compared with placebo, no intervention, or active control (≤600 IU d-1). Risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences were pooled for 38 maternal, birth, and infant outcomes, using random effects models. Subgroup analyses examined effect heterogeneity. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used. Included articles reported on a total of 66 trials (n = 17 276 participants). The median vitamin D supplementation dose was 2000 IU d-1 (range: 400-60 000); 37 trials used placebo. Antenatal vitamin D supplementation had no effect on the risk of preeclampsia (RR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.43-1.53]; n = 6 trials and 1483 participants), potentially protected against gestational diabetes mellitus (RR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.49-0.86; n = 12 trials and 1992 participants), and increased infant birth weight by 53 g (95% CI, 16-90; n = 40 trials and 9954 participants). No effect of vitamin D on the risk of preterm birth, small-for-gestational age, or low birth weight infants was found. A total of 25 trials had at least 1 domain at high risk of bias. Additional studies among the general pregnant population are not needed, given the many existing trials. Instead, high-quality RCTs among populations with low vitamin D status or at greater risk of key outcomes are needed. Benefits of supplementation in pregnancy remain uncertain because current evidence has high heterogeneity, including variation in study context, baseline and achieved end-line 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, and studies with high risk of bias.

38917435,Effects of cinnamon supplementation on metabolic biomarkers in individuals with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The global prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) has been rising significantly over the years. Recent studies have shown beneficial effects of cinnamon on metabolic biomarkers. The objective of this review was to assess the effect of cinnamon supplementation on metabolic biomarkers in patients with DM2. The Pubmed/MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Embase databases were searched up to November 10, 2022. A systematic search was performed for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of cinnamon supplementation on metabolic biomarkers, in adults and the elderly with DM2, and comparing the data for a cinnamon intervention group with that for a placebo group or a control group. The main exclusion criteria were studies (1) with other types of diabetes (ie, gestational diabetes or type 1 diabetes), (2) without cinnamon consumption, (3) that did not evaluate metabolic biomarkers, or (4) in vitro and animal studies. Two researchers independently screened 924 records, evaluated full-text studies, extracted data, and appraised their quality. A third researcher was consulted to resolve any discrepancies. The data were pooled using random-effects models and expressed as the weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% CI. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q test and quantified using I2 statistics. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) instrument. Sensitivity analysis and the GRADE system were used to assess the robustness and certainty of the findings. In total, 28 RCTs with a duration ranging from 30 to 120 days and a total enrollment of 3054 patients with DM2 were included. Participants consuming cinnamon showed a significant reduction in fasting blood glucose (FBG) (WMD: -15.26 mg/dL; 95% CI: -22.23 to -8.30; I2 = 88%), postprandial glucose (WMD: -39.22 mg/dL; 95% CI: -63.90 to -14.55; I2 = 100%), HbA1c (WMD: -0.56 mg/dL; 95% CI: -0.99 to -0.13; I2 = 94%), and HOMA-IR (WMD = -0.76, 95% CI: -1.13 to -0.39; I2 = 22%) compared with the control group. An intervention of cinnamon in capsule form reduced FBG (WMD:-18.43 mg/dL, 95% CI: -26.32 to -10.53; I2 = 89%), postprandial glucose (WMD: -44.83 mg/dL, 95% CI: -70.67 to -18.99; I2 = 100%), HbA1c (WMD: -0.56 mg/dL, 95% CI: -1.02 to -0.09; I2 = 94%), total cholesterol (WMD: -13.39 mg/dL; 95% CI: -24.71 to -2.07; I2 = 96%), LDL-C (WMD: -6.49 mg/dL, 95% CI: -12.69 to -0.29; I2 = 92%), and triglycerides (WND: -19.75 mg/dL; 95% CI, -33.71 to -5.80; I2 = 88%). Both doses (≤2 g/day and >2 g/day) reduced FBG and postprandial glucose. Only cinnamon doses of ≤2 g/day reduced HbA1c (WMD: -0.68 mg/dL, 95% CI: -1.16 to -0.1; I2 = 92%), HOMA-IR (WMD: -0.94 mg/dL; 95% CI: -1.21 to -0.67; I2 = 0%), and BMI (WMD: -1.18 kg/m2; 95% CI: -1.97 to -0.39; I2 = 0%).

38892706,"Nutrition, Vitamin D, and Calcium in Elderly Patients before and after a Hip Fracture and Their Impact on the Musculoskeletal System: A Narrative Review.","Hip fractures are a major health issue considerably impacting patients' quality of life and well-being. This is particularly evident in elderly subjects, in which the decline in bone and muscle mass coexists and predisposes individuals to fall and fracture. Among interventions to be implemented in hip fractured patients, the assessment and management of nutritional status is pivotal, particularly in subjects older than 65. Nutrition plays a central role in both primary and secondary preventions of fracture. An adequate protein intake improves muscle mass and strength and the intestinal absorption of calcium. Other nutrients with recognized beneficial effects on bone health are calcium, vitamins D, K, and C, potassium, magnesium, folate, and carotenoids. With reference to calcium, results from longitudinal studies showed that the consumption of dairy foods has a protective role against fractures. Moreover, the most recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses and one umbrella review demonstrated that the combination of calcium and vitamin D supplementation significantly reduces hip fracture risk, with presumed higher efficacy in older and institutionalized subjects. Owing to these reasons, the adequate intake of calcium, vitamin D, protein, and other macro and micronutrients has been successfully implemented in the Fracture Liaison Services (FLSs) that represent the most reliable model of management for hip fracture patients. In this narrative review, papers (randomized controlled trials, prospective and intervention studies, and systematic reviews) retrieved by records from three different databases (PubMed, Embase, and Medline) have been analyzed, and the available information on the screening, assessment, and management of nutritional and vitamin D status and calcium intake in patients with hip fractures is presented along with specific prevention and treatment measures.",Cianferotti L; Bifolco G; Caffarelli C; Mazziotti G; Migliaccio S; Napoli N; Ruggiero C; Cipriani C,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38892706/,1,0,0,0,0,1

However, there is a need for early effective management in patients with early stage of DR before its progression into the more severe sight-threatening proliferative stage. Nutraceuticals, natural functional foods with few side effects, have been proposed to be beneficial in patients with DR. Over the decades, many studies, either in vitro or in vivo, have demonstrated the advantages of a number of nutraceuticals in DR with their antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, or vasoprotective effects. However, only a few clinical trials have been conducted, and their outcomes varied. The low bioavailability and instability of many nutraceuticals have indeed hindered their utilization in clinical use. In this context, nanoparticle carriers have been developed to deliver nutraceuticals and to improve their bioavailability. Despite its preclinical nature, research of interventive nutraceuticals for DR may yield promising information in their clinical applications.",Ye X; Fung NSK; Lam WC; Lo ACY,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38892648/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38892608,The Effect of Microbiome-Modulating Agents (MMAs) on Type 1 Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"Gut microbiome-modulating agents (MMAs), including probiotics, prebiotics, postbiotics, and synbiotics, are shown to ameliorate type 1 diabetes (T1D) by restoring the microbiome from dysbiosis. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the impact of MMAs on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and biomarkers associated with (T1D). A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, National Knowledge Infrastructure, WeiPu, and WanFang Data up to 30 November 2023. Ten randomized controlled trials (<i>n</i> = 630) were included, with study quality evaluated using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Random-effect models with standardized mean differences (SMDs) were utilized. MMA supplementation was associated with improvements in HbA1c (SMD = -0.52, 95% CI [-0.83, -0.20]), daily insulin usage (SMD = -0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) [-0.76, -0.07]), and fasting C-peptide (SMD = 0.99, 95% CI [0.17, 1.81]) but had no effects on FBG, CRP, TNF-α, IL-10, LDL, HDL, and the Shannon index. Subgroup analysis of HbA1c indicated that a long-term intervention (>3 months) might exert a more substantial effect. These findings suggest an association between MMAs and glycemic control in T1D. Further large-scale clinical trials are necessary to confirm these findings with investigations on inflammation and gut microbiota composition while adjusting confounding factors such as diet, physical activity, and the dose and form of MMA intervention.",Zhang Y; Huang A; Li J; Munthali W; Cao S; Putri UMP; Yang L,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38892608/,0,1,0,1,0,0
38892607,Anthocyanins and Type 2 Diabetes: An Update of Human Study and Clinical Trial.,"Anthocyanins are phenolic compounds occurring in fruits and vegetables. Evidence from pre-clinical studies indicates their role in glucose level regulation, gut microbiota improvement, and inflammation reduction under diabetic conditions. Therefore, incorporating these research advancements into clinical practice would significantly improve the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. This narrative review provides a concise overview of 18 findings from recent clinical research published over the last 5 years that investigate the therapeutic effects of dietary anthocyanins on diabetes. Anthocyanin supplementation has been shown to have a regulatory effect on fasting blood glucose levels, glycated hemoglobin, and other diabetes-related indicators. Furthermore, increased anthocyanin dosages had more favorable implications for diabetes treatment. This review provides evidence that an anthocyanin-rich diet can improve diabetes outcomes, especially in at-risk groups. Future research should focus on optimal intervention duration, consider multiple clinical biomarkers, and analyze anthocyanin effects among well-controlled versus poorly controlled groups of patients with diabetes.",Kozłowska A; Nitsch-Osuch A,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38892607/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38892583,Omega-3 Supplementation and Its Effects on Osteoarthritis.,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the destruction of the articular cartilage, resulting in a pro-inflammatory response. The progression of OA is multifactorial and is influenced by the underlying cause of inflammation, which includes but is not limited to trauma, metabolism, biology, comorbidities, and biomechanics. Although articular cartilage is the main tissue affected in osteoarthritis, the chronic inflammatory environment negatively influences the surrounding synovium, ligaments, and subchondral bone, further limiting their functional abilities and enhancing symptoms of OA. Treatment for osteoarthritis remains inconsistent due to the inability to determine the underlying mechanism of disease onset, severity of symptoms, and complicating comorbidities. In recent years, diet and nutritional supplements have gained interest regarding slowing the disease process, prevention, and treatment of OA. This is due to their anti-inflammatory properties, which result in a positive influence on pain, joint mobility, and cartilage formation. More specifically, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have demonstrated an influential role in the progression of OA, resulting in the reduction of cartilage destruction, inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine cascades, and production of oxylipins that promote anti-inflammatory pathways. The present review is focused on the assessment of evidence explaining the inflammatory processes of osteoarthritis and the influence of omega-3 supplementation to modulate the progression of osteoarthritis.",Shawl M; Geetha T; Burnett D; Babu JR,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38892583/,1,0,0,0,0,0

This condition, known as a ""metabolic syndrome"" (MetS), presents a global challenge and appears to be the underlying mechanism for the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). This review is designed based on evidence indicating the pathogenic mechanisms of MetS. In detail, we will look at the mechanisms of oxidative stress induction in MetS, the effects of elevated oxidative stress levels on the condition's pathophysiology, and matters related to endothelial function. According to different components of the MetS pathophysiological network, the effects of antioxidants and endothelial dysfunction are reviewed. After considering the strategic role of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of MetS and its associated CVDs, oxidative stress management by antioxidant supplementation seems an appropriate therapeutic approach.",Sharebiani H; Mokaram M; Mirghani M; Fazeli B; Stanek A,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38892574/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38881087,Fortifying Micronutrient Supplementation in India: Indian Expert consensus.,"Micronutrients play a key role in human health, being involved in energy metabolism, immunity, cellular functioning, growth, and development. Deficiencies in micronutrients occur in individuals of all ages due to several factors, including inadequate diets, disease states, and overweight/obesity. Guidelines from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) Expert Group on Nutrient Requirements for Indians (2023) have specified the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for macronutrients and micronutrients. In addition, a healthy diet is crucial for overall health and should be the first step toward addressing micronutrient deficiencies. When diet is inadequate, micronutrient supplements can be provided to compensate. An expert panel of Indian doctors was convened to develop a pathway toward micronutrient supplementation among the Indian population. This Consensus Statement recognizes that different populations have varying needs for specific micronutrients, and ensuring adequate intake of such micronutrients can improve health outcomes. The panel provided recommendations for dietary practices and micronutrient supplementation when diet is inadequate. Addressing micronutrient deficiencies at the primary care level can prevent chronic deficiencies and their consequences. This Consensus Statement can serve as a primer for physicians to monitor and address deficiencies and thus help individuals maintain their health.",Saboo B; Gupta A; Tiwaskar M; Joshi S; Maheshwari A; Murthy LS; Panda J; Verma N; Kesavadev J; Srivastava S; Saxena D; Muruganathan A; Singh S; Sharma A,The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38881087/,0,0,0,0,0,0

This review was done to identify potential herbal remedies that may help improve glycemic parameters, leading to better health outcomes in combination with current antidiabetic treatment. This systematic review was based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). It was conducted in 2023 with sources and databases from MEDLINE, EBSCO-Host, ScienceDirect and ProQuest. This paper included randomized-controlled trials exploring the effects of the combination of curcumin and piperine on patients with prediabetes and T2DM. Systematic reviews, observational studies, case reports, case series, conference abstracts, book sections, commentaries/editorials, non-human studies and articles with unavailable full-text and written in non-English language, were excluded. The key terms for the literature search were ""curcumin,"" ""piperine,"" ""prediabetes"" and ""Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus."" We use Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) 2 for quality assessment of the included studies and Review Manager (RevMan) 5.4 to do the meta-analysis. A total of three studies were included in this systematic review. Two studies from Neta et al., and Cicero et al., showed no significant difference in HOMA-IR, BMI and FPG levels between the curcumin, piperine and placebo groups. One study from Panahi et al. demonstrated a significant difference in BMI levels between the curcumin and piperine and placebo groups (<i>p</i> <0.01).

However, contradictory results have been obtained chemical rodent models of diabetes. The current review analyses the effects of dietary Cr supplementation of rodent models of prediabetes, where the condition is administered using a high-fat or high-sugar diet. Rat model studies display a range of quality, with studies utilizing basal diets of known Cr content suggesting Cr beneficially affects insulin sensitivity. Mouse model studies display too much heterogeneity in results for any firm conclusions to be drawn.

38850469,Clinical Practice Guidelines of the Latin American Federation of Endocrinology for the use of vitamin D in the maintenance of bone health: recommendations for the Latin American context.,"These guidelines aim to provide evidence-based recommendations for the supplementation of Vitamin D in maintaining bone health. An unmet need persists in Latin American regarding the availability of clinical and real-world data for rationalizing the use of vitamin D supplementation. The objective of these guidelines is to establish clear and practical recommendations for healthcare practitioners from Latin American countries to address Vitamin D insufficiency in clinical practice. The guidelines were developed according to the GRADE-ADOLOPMENT methodology for the adaptation or adoption of CPGs or evidence-based recommendations. A search for high quality CPGs was complemented through a comprehensive review of recent literature, including randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and systematic reviews evaluating the effects of Vitamin D supplementation on bone health. The evidence to decision framework proposed by the GRADE Working Group was implemented by a panel of experts in endocrinology, bone health, and clinical research. The guidelines recommend Vitamin D supplementation for individuals aged 18 and above, considering various populations, including healthy adults, individuals with osteopenia, osteoporosis patients, and institutionalized older adults. These recommendations offer dosing regimens depending on an individualized treatment plan, and monitoring intervals of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and adjustments based on individual results. The guidelines highlight the role of Vitamin D in bone health and propose a standardized approach for healthcare practitioners to address Vitamin D insufficiency across Latin America. The panel underscored the necessity for generating local data and stressed the importance of considering regional geography, social dynamics, and cultural specificities when implementing these guidelines.",Gómez O; Campusano C; Cerdas-P S; Mendoza B; Páez-Talero A; de la Peña-Rodríguez MP; Reza-Albarrán AA; Rueda-Plata PN,Archives of osteoporosis,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38850469/,0,0,0,0,0,0

The scientific focus in the prevention or progression modification of T1D is mostly centered on four dietary compounds and their modifications - gluten and its omission, vitamin D supplementation, omega-3 fatty acids supplementation, and decreasing of the amount of ingested carbohydrates. The aim of this narrative review was to provide an overview of nutritional interventions studied in children either as preventive methods or as modifiers in the early stages of T1D from autoantibody positive individuals to persons with newly diagnosed T1D. Our review shows that dietary modifications in various dietary components might be useful but none of them seems to provide universal effects in T1D prevention or progression modification.

38836946,Optimisation of vitamin D status in global populations.,"Vitamin D is important for musculoskeletal health. Concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the most commonly measured metabolite, vary markedly around the world and are influenced by many factors including sun exposure, skin pigmentation, covering, season and supplement use. Whilst overt vitamin D deficiency with biochemical consequences presents an increased risk of severe sequelae such as rickets, osteomalacia or cardiomyopathy and usually warrants prompt replacement treatment, the role of vitamin D supplementation in the population presents a different set of considerations. Here the issue is to keep, on average, the population at a level whereby the risk of adverse health outcomes in the population is minimised. This position paper, which complements recently published work from the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases, addresses key considerations regarding vitamin D assessment and intervention from the population perspective.

38828942,A Systematic Review Supporting the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines on Vitamin D.,"Low vitamin D status is common and is associated with various common medical conditions. To support the development of the Endocrine Society's Clinical Practice Guideline on Vitamin D for the Prevention of Disease. We searched multiple databases for studies that addressed 14 clinical questions prioritized by the guideline panel. Of the 14 questions, 10 clinical questions assessed the effect of vitamin D vs no vitamin D in the general population throughout the lifespan, during pregnancy, and in adults with prediabetes; 1 question assessed dosing; and 3 questions addressed screening with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D). The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to assess certainty of evidence. Electronic searches yielded 37 007 citations, from which we included 151 studies. In children and adolescents, low-certainty evidence suggested reduction in respiratory tract infections with empiric vitamin D. There was no significant effect on select outcomes in healthy adults aged 19 to 74 years with variable certainty of evidence. There was a very small reduction in mortality among adults older than 75 years with high certainty of evidence. In pregnant women, low-certainty evidence suggested possible benefit on various maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes. In adults with prediabetes, moderate certainty of evidence suggested reduction in the rate of progression to diabetes. Administration of high-dose intermittent vitamin D may increase falls, compared to lower-dose daily dosing. We did not identify trials on the benefits and harms of screening with serum 25(OH)D. The evidence summarized in this systematic review addresses the benefits and harms of vitamin D for the prevention of disease. The guideline panel considered additional information about individuals' and providers' values and preferences and other important decisional and contextual factors to develop clinical recommendations.",Shah VP; Nayfeh T; Alsawaf Y; Saadi S; Farah M; Zhu Y; Firwana M; Seisa M; Wang Z; Scragg R; Kiely ME; Lips P; Mitchell DM; Demay MB; Pittas AG; Murad MH,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38828942/,0,1,0,0,0,0
38828931,Vitamin D for the Prevention of Disease: An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline.,"Numerous studies demonstrate associations between serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) and a variety of common disorders, including musculoskeletal, metabolic, cardiovascular, malignant, autoimmune, and infectious diseases. Although a causal link between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and many disorders has not been clearly established, these associations have led to widespread supplementation with vitamin D and increased laboratory testing for 25(OH)D in the general population. The benefit-risk ratio of this increase in vitamin D use is not clear, and the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain. To develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower the risk of disease in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing. A multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts, along with experts in guideline methodology and systematic literature review, identified and prioritized 14 clinically relevant questions related to the use of vitamin D and 25(OH)D testing to lower the risk of disease. The panel prioritized randomized placebo-controlled trials in general populations (without an established indication for vitamin D treatment or 25[OH]D testing), evaluating the effects of empiric vitamin D administration throughout the lifespan, as well as in select conditions (pregnancy and prediabetes). The panel defined ""empiric supplementation"" as vitamin D intake that (a) exceeds the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) and (b) is implemented without testing for 25(OH)D. Systematic reviews queried electronic databases for publications related to these 14 clinical questions. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and guide recommendations. The approach incorporated perspectives from a patient representative and considered patient values, costs and resources required, acceptability and feasibility, and impact on health equity of the proposed recommendations. The process to develop this clinical guideline did not use a risk assessment framework and was not designed to replace current DRI for vitamin D. The panel suggests empiric vitamin D supplementation for children and adolescents aged 1 to 18 years to prevent nutritional rickets and because of its potential to lower the risk of respiratory tract infections; for those aged 75 years and older because of its potential to lower the risk of mortality; for those who are pregnant because of its potential to lower the risk of preeclampsia, intra-uterine mortality, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age birth, and neonatal mortality; and for those with high-risk prediabetes because of its potential to reduce progression to diabetes. Because the vitamin D doses in the included clinical trials varied considerably and many trial participants were allowed to continue their own vitamin D-containing supplements, the optimal doses for empiric vitamin D supplementation remain unclear for the populations considered. For nonpregnant people older than 50 years for whom vitamin D is indicated, the panel suggests supplementation via daily administration of vitamin D, rather than intermittent use of high doses. The panel suggests against empiric vitamin D supplementation above the current DRI to lower the risk of disease in healthy adults younger than 75 years. No clinical trial evidence was found to support routine screening for 25(OH)D in the general population, nor in those with obesity or dark complexion, and there was no clear evidence defining the optimal target level of 25(OH)D required for disease prevention in the populations considered; thus, the panel suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing in all populations considered. The panel judged that, in most situations, empiric vitamin D supplementation is inexpensive, feasible, acceptable to both healthy individuals and health care professionals, and has no negative effect on health equity. The panel suggests empiric vitamin D for those aged 1 to 18 years and adults over 75 years of age, those who are pregnant, and those with high-risk prediabetes. Due to the scarcity of natural food sources rich in vitamin D, empiric supplementation can be achieved through a combination of fortified foods and supplements that contain vitamin D. Based on the absence of supportive clinical trial evidence, the panel suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing in the absence of established indications. These recommendations are not meant to replace the current DRIs for vitamin D, nor do they apply to people with established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing. Further research is needed to determine optimal 25(OH)D levels for specific health benefits.",Demay MB; Pittas AG; Bikle DD; Diab DL; Kiely ME; Lazaretti-Castro M; Lips P; Mitchell DM; Murad MH; Powers S; Rao SD; Scragg R; Tayek JA; Valent AM; Walsh JME; McCartney CR,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38828931/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38816412,Effects of vitamin D in pregnancy on maternal and offspring health-related outcomes: An umbrella review of systematic review and meta-analyses.,"Vitamin D deficiency has been linked with several adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. To summarize systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluating the effects of vitamin D deficiency and of vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy on maternal and offspring health-related outcomes. Prior to conducting this umbrella review, we registered the protocol in PROSPERO (CRD42022368003). We conducted searches in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for systematic reviews and meta-analyses on vitamin D in pregnancy, from database inception to October 2, 2023. All outcomes related to vitamin D in pregnancy obtained from the systematic reviews and meta-analyses were extracted. Two reviewers independently chose studies and collected information on health outcomes. The quality of the included articles' methodology was assessed using AMSTAR 2 (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews-2). We identified 16 eligible systematic reviews and meta-analyses, which included 250,569 women. Our results demonstrated that vitamin D deficiency in pregnancy is associated with increased risk of preterm birth, small-for gestational age/low birth weight infants, recurrent miscarriage, bacterial vaginosis and gestational diabetes mellitus. Vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy increases birth weight, and reduces the risk of maternal pre-eclampsia, miscarriage, and vitamin D deficiency, fetal or neonatal mortality, as well as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorder in childhood. In women with gestational diabetes mellitus, vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy can reduce the risk of maternal hyperbilirubinemia, polyhydramnios, macrosomia, fetal distress, and neonatal hospitalization. Due to the association with adverse maternal and offspring health outcomes, we recommend the vitamin D status in pregnancy should be monitored, particularly in women at high risk of vitamin D deficiency. It is suggested that pregnant women take a dose of >400 IU/day of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy to prevent certain adverse outcomes.",Chien MC; Huang CY; Wang JH; Shih CL; Wu P,Nutrition & diabetes,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38816412/,0,1,0,0,0,0
38807919,Micronutrients in Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes.,"About 10 to 20% of reported pregnancies have complications like spontaneous abortion (SA), preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB), and fetal growth restriction (FGR); 60% are attributed to maternal nutritional alterations. Multiple micronutrients (MMN) are supplemented in the antenatal period, but no proper validation/guidelines are available regarding dosing/time, the need for initiation, and the duration of supplementation. Studies have reported adverse pregnancy complications related to the overuse/unwanted use of multiple micronutrient supplementations during pregnancy. Identifying the exact population requiring supplementation is necessary to prevent its abuse. This article attempts to review the impacts of micronutrient deficiency/supplementation in cases of SA, FGR, and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), preterm delivery and PE. The study used a literature search using PubMed, Google Scholar, Mendeley, and Scopus Databases using search words pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), fetal growth restriction (FGR), preterm delivery, preeclampsia (PE) or ""adverse pregnancy"" associated with minerals, micronutrients, or supplementation. The review also considered in-house literature databases, a single-window search at Kasturba Medical College (KMC) Health sciences library, MAHE (Manipal Academy of Higher Education). The figures included in the study were created by Biorender.com. Micronutrients play multiple roles during pregnancy and fetoplacental growth stimulating growth hormone secretion, Lysyl oxidase (LOX), involved in the crosslinking between collagen and elastin in the amniotic membrane, downregulation of interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-4, IL-6, Il-10, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and several chemokines involved in hypertension, immune-inflammatory pathways, attenuate insulin resistance, structural development of neurons and glia. Over-supplementation has led to complications such as spontaneous abortion and gestational diabetes mellitus. Since there is a lack of standardization concerning micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy, there is a need for systematic study related to the role of micronutrients during each trimester of pregnancy to optimize its supplementation and to prevent hazards associated with its abuse.",Prabhu K; Dastidar RG; Aroor AR; Rao M; Shetty S; Poojari VG; Bs V,F1000Research,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38807919/,1,0,0,0,0,0

These supplements not only aim to have an anti-hyperglycaemic effect but also seek to reduce oxidative stress to prevent diabetes complications. This systematic literature systematic review aims to evaluate the efficacy of curcumin, resveratrol, and cinnamon in modulating oxidative stress and antioxidant activity in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Data were collected from PubMed, Web of Sciences, and Scopus databases regarding the impact of curcumin, resveratrol, and cinnamon on total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels for this review. Effect sizes for each study were calculated using Cohen's or Hedges's d coefficient. Parameters of oxidative stress and inflammatory status, such as TAC, MDA, TNF-α, IL-6, and hs-CRP, improved following phytochemicals. Additionally, curcumin, resveratrol, and cinnamon exhibited regulatory effects on carbohydrate metabolism by reducing glucose, insulin, and glycated haemoglobin concentrations and lipid metabolism by lowering total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglycerides (TG) and increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Incorporating curcumin, resveratrol, and cinnamon into diets may be beneficial for maintaining organism homeostasis and improving metabolic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

38777458,Effects of Lactobacillus plantarum supplementation on glucose and lipid metabolism in type 2 diabetes mellitus and prediabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Lactobacillus plantarum has been shown to improve glucose and lipid metabolism in mouse models of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, it remains unclear whether such benefits extend to humans. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed to clarify the effect of L. plantarum supplementation on glucose and lipid metabolism in T2DM and prediabetes. The PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases were searched. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled mean difference with 95% CI (confidence interval). L. plantarum supplementation reduced the levels of fasting plasma glucose (-0.41, 95%CI -0.63, -0.19 mg/dL; n = 5) and hemoglobin A1c (-0.2, 95%CI: -0.3, 0%; n = 4). A non-statistically significant tendency towards improvements in the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (MD: -0.74, 95%CI: -1.72, 0.25; n = 3), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-6.87; 95%CI: -15.03, 1.29 mg/dL; n = 3), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD: 1.34; 95%CI: -0.78, 3.46 mg/dL; n = 3), triglyceride (MD: -3.90; 95%CI: -11.05, 3.24 mg/dL; n = 3), and total cholesterol (MD: -4.88; 95%CI: -11.84, 2.07 mg/dL; n = 3) was observed with the supplementation. In summary, while the evidence from the currently available RCTs provides a crude indication that L. plantarum supplementation might improve glucose and lipid metabolism in patients with T2DM and prediabetes, the benefits of the supplementation are likely subtle, and its clinical significance requires further investigation.",Zhong H; Wang L; Jia F; Yan Y; Xiong F; Li Y; Hidayat K; Guan R,Clinical nutrition ESPEN,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38777458/,0,1,0,1,0,0
38777417,Vitamin D and bone health: What vitamin D can and cannot do.,"Historically vitamin D deficiency had devastating consequences for children causing rickets resulting in severe bone deformities often leading to death. The mystery of the cause of rickets finally came to light when it was observed that cod liver oil and sunlight could prevent and cure rickets. The first vitamin D to be discovered was vitamin D<sub>2</sub> from ergosterol in ultraviolet irradiated yeast. Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> was discovered from UV exposure to the skin. Investigations revealed the two major functions of vitamin D were to increase intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption and mobilize calcium from the skeleton to maintain calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. Later studies demonstrated that vitamin D does not have an active role in bone mineralization. Vitamin D deficiency results in secondary hyperparathyroidism increasing bone resorption. As a result, this decreases bone mineral content and compromises the architectural integrity increasing risk for fracture. Vitamin D deficiency has also been shown to enhance aging of the bone causing cracks and enhancing bone fractures. Vitamin D deficiency also causes osteomalacia. Therefore, vitamin D sufficiency is extremely important to maximize bone health throughout life. It helps to prevent bone loss, but it cannot restore bone loss due to increased bone resorption that can occur under a variety of circumstances including menopause. The Endocrine Society Guidelines recommends for all ages that adequate vitamin D obtained from the sun, foods and supplements is necessary in order to maintain a circulating concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D of at least 30 ng/mL for maximum bone health.",Holick MF,Advances in food and nutrition research,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38777417/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38777412,Diabetes and vitamin D: The effect of insulin sensitivity and gut microbial health.,"Current global estimation suggests that about 10% of adults worldwide have diabetes, thus, various strategies are needed to address the issue, including dietary factors such as vitamin D. Various studies have suggested an inverse associations between vitamin D and the risks and pathogenesis of all forms of diabetes (type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes). The underlying mechanism is not fully understood; however, the expression of vitamin D receptors in pancreatic beta cells suggests an important physiological role for vitamin D in beta cell function. Vitamin D deficiency may impair blood glucose control and decrease insulin sensitivity by reducing insulin secretion from beta cells. Many studies suggest that vitamin D intervention may be beneficial; however, there is inconclusive evidence of the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation on reducing the risks or managing the pathogenesis of all forms of diabetes. Part of the pathogenesis of vitamin D for reducing diabetes is thought to be related to its impact on gut microbiota profile, via the suggested prebiotic properties of vitamin D.",Daley DK; Myrie SB,Advances in food and nutrition research,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38777412/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38768866,The effects of policosanol supplementation on blood glucose: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Previous studies have assessed how supplementing with policosanol affects blood sugar levels. The outcomes, nevertheless, were not constant. Multiple electronic databases were searched including ISI Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus until February 9, 2023. To assess the effects of policosanol on glucose, we employed a random-effects or fixed-effects meta-analysis approach to examine the weighted mean differences (WMDs) and associated 95 % confidence intervals (CI) before and after policosanol and placebo administration. The final analysis comprised a total of 25 trials with 2680 participants. Compared to the control group, policosanol supplementation significantly reduced blood glucose levels (WMD: -2.24 mg/dl; 95 % CI: -4.05, -0.42, P = 0.01). Findings from subgroup analysis revealed a significant reduction of policosanol supplementation on glucose levels in period of less than 24 weeks, and in individuals below 50 years of age. Additionally, the reduction was statistically significant in dosage of 10 mg/day. Our dose-response analysis indicates no evidence of a non-linear relationship between policosanol dose and duration and changes in glucose levels (P-nonlinearity = 0.52, and P-nonlinearity = 0.52, respectively). Policosanol supplementation might improve blood glucose. Further trials with more complex designs are required to confirm the findings.",Reza Amini M; Kazeminejad S; Jalalzadeh M; Sadeghi Majd S; Kavyani Z; Askari G; Hekmatdoost A,Diabetes research and clinical practice,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38768866/,0,1,0,1,0,0
38755142,Taurine reduces the risk for metabolic syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of interconnected risk factors that significantly increase the likelihood of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Taurine has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent for MetS. This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed to evaluate the effects of taurine supplementation on MetS-related parameters. We conducted electronic searches through databases like Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov, encompassing publications up to December 1, 2023. Our analysis focused on established MetS diagnostic criteria, including systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglyceride (TG), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Meta-regression explored potential dose-dependent relationships based on the total taurine dose administered during the treatment period. We also assessed secondary outcomes like body composition, lipid profile, and glycemic control. Our analysis included 1024 participants from 25 RCTs. The daily dosage of taurine in the studies ranged from 0.5 g/day to 6 g/day, with follow-up periods varying between 5 and 365 days. Compared to control groups, taurine supplementation demonstrated statistically significant reductions in SBP (weighted mean difference [WMD] = -3.999 mmHg, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -7.293 to -0.706, p = 0.017), DBP (WMD = -1.509 mmHg, 95% CI = -2.479 to -0.539, p = 0.002), FBG (WMD: -5.882 mg/dL, 95% CI: -10.747 to -1.018, p = 0.018), TG (WMD: -18.315 mg/dL, 95% CI: -25.628 to -11.002, p < 0.001), but not in HDL-C (WMD: 0.644 mg/dl, 95% CI: -0.244 to 1.532, p = 0.155). Meta-regression analysis revealed a dose-dependent reduction in DBP (coefficient = -0.0108 mmHg per g, p = 0.0297) and FBG (coefficient = -0.0445 mg/dL per g, p = 0.0273). No significant adverse effects were observed compared to the control group. Taurine supplementation exhibits positive effects on multiple MetS-related factors, making it a potential dietary addition for individuals at risk of or already experiencing MetS. Future research may explore dose-optimization strategies and potential long-term benefits of taurine for MetS management.",Tzang CC; Chi LY; Lin LH; Lin TY; Chang KV; Wu WT; Özçakar L,Nutrition & diabetes,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38755142/,0,1,0,1,0,1
38732128,Supplementation of Micro- and Macronutrients-A Role of Nutritional Status in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition in which the pathological cumulation of fat with coexisting inflammation and damage of hepatic cells leads to progressive dysfunctions of the liver. Except for the commonly well-known major causes of NAFLD such as obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, or diabetes, an unbalanced diet and imbalanced nutritional status should also be taken into consideration. In this narrative review, we summarized the current knowledge regarding the micro- and macronutrient status of patients suffering from NAFLD considering various diets and supplementation of chosen supplements. We aimed to summarize the knowledge indicating which nutritional impairments may be associated with the onset and progression of NAFLD at the same time evaluating the potential therapy targets that could facilitate the healing process. Except for the above-mentioned objectives, one of the most important aspects of this review was to highlight the possible strategies for taking care of NAFLD patients taking into account the challenges and opportunities associated with the micronutrient status of the patients. The current research indicates that a supplementation of chosen vitamins (e.g., vitamin A, B complex, C, or D) as well as chosen elements such as zinc may alleviate the symptoms of NAFLD. However, there is still a lack of sufficient data regarding healthy ranges of dosages; thus, further research is of high importance in this matter.",Tyczyńska M; Hunek G; Szczasny M; Brachet A; Januszewski J; Forma A; Portincasa P; Flieger J; Baj J,International journal of molecular sciences,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38732128/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38721870,Calcium supplementation for people with overweight or obesity.,"Obesity is a major health problem worldwide as it can lead to high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and insulin resistance. The prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing worldwide across different age groups. There is evidence of an inverse relationship between calcium intake and body weight. The clinical relevance of a small reduction in body weight has been questioned. However, at a population level, a small effect could mitigate the observed global trends. To assess the effects of calcium supplementation on weight loss in individuals living with overweight or obesity. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database), and two clinical trials registries. The date of the last search of all databases (except Embase) was 10 May 2023. No language restrictions were applied. We included randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of calcium in participants with overweight or obesity of any age or gender. We excluded studies in participants with absorption problems. We included studies of any dose with a minimum duration of two months. We included the following comparisons: calcium supplementation versus placebo, calcium-fortified food or beverage versus placebo, or calcium-fortified food or beverage versus non-calcium-fortified food or beverage. We excluded studies that evaluated the effect of calcium and vitamin D or mixed minerals compared to placebo. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were body weight, health-related quality of life, and adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were anthropometric measures other than body weight, all-cause mortality, and morbidity. We found 18 studies that evaluated the effect of calcium compared to placebo or control, with a total of 1873 randomised participants (950 participants in the calcium supplementation groups and 923 in the control groups). All included studies gave oral calcium supplementation as the intervention. We did not find any studies evaluating calcium-fortified foods. We excluded 38 studies, identified four ongoing studies, and listed one study as 'awaiting classification'. Sixteen studies compared calcium supplementation to placebo; two studies compared different doses of calcium supplementation. Doses ranged from very low (0.162 g of calcium/day) to high (1.5 g of calcium/day). Most studies were performed in the USA and Iran, lasted less than six months, and included only women. Low-certainty evidence suggests that calcium supplementation compared to placebo or control may result in little to no difference in body weight (mean difference (MD) -0.15 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.55 to 0.24; P = 0.45, I<sup>2</sup> = 46%; 17 studies, 1317 participants; low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence by two levels for risk of bias and heterogeneity. None of the included studies reported health-related quality of life, all-cause mortality, or morbidity/complications as outcomes. Only five studies assessed or reported adverse events. Low-certainty evidence suggests a low frequency of adverse events, with no clear difference between intervention and control groups. Moderate-certainty evidence shows that calcium supplementation compared to placebo or control probably results in a small reduction in body mass index (BMI) (MD -0.18 kg/m<sup>2</sup>,95% CI -0.22 to -0.13; P < 0.001, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 9 studies, 731 participants) and waist circumference (MD -0.51 cm, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.29; P < 0.001, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 6 studies, 273 participants). Low-certainty evidence suggests that calcium supplementation compared to placebo or control may result in a small reduction in body fat mass (MD -0.34 kg, 95% CI -0.73 to 0.05; P < 0.001, I<sup>2</sup> = 97%; 12 studies, 812 participants). Calcium supplementation for eight weeks to 24 months may result in little to no difference in body weight in people with overweight or obesity. The current evidence is of low certainty, due to concerns regarding risk of bias and statistical heterogeneity. We found that the degree of heterogeneity might be partly explained by calcium dosage, the presence or absence of a co-intervention, and whether an intention-to-treat analysis was pursued. While our analyses suggest that calcium supplementation may result in a small reduction in BMI, waist circumference, and fat mass, this evidence is of low to moderate certainty. Future studies could investigate the effect of calcium supplementation on lean body mass to explore if there is a change in body composition.",Cormick G; Ciapponi A; Harbron J; Perez SM; Vazquez P; Rivo J; Metzendorf MI; Althabe F; Belizán JM,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38721870/,0,1,0,1,0,0
38716687,"n-3 fatty acids and the risk of atrial fibrillation, review.","Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent type of cardiac arrhythmia that affects over six million individuals in Europe. The incidence and prevalence of AF rises with age, and often occurs after cardiac surgery. Other risk factors correlated with AF comprise high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, left atrial enlargement, ischemic heart disease, and congestive heart failure. Considering the high prevalence of AF in aging societies, strategies to prevent serious complications, such as stroke or heart failure, are important because they are correlated with high morbidity and mortality. The supplementation of sea-derived n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is widely discussed in this context, but the results of experimental and observational studies are in contrast to randomized placebo-controlled intervention trials (RCTs). Specifically, larger placebo-controlled n-3 PUFA supplementation studies with long follow-up showed a dose-dependent rise in incident AF. Daily n-3 PUFA doses of ≥1 g/d are correlated with a 50 % increase in AF risk, whereas a daily intake of <1 g/d causes AF in only 12 %. Individuals with a high cardiovascular risk (CVD) risk and high plasma-triglycerides seem particularly prone to develop AF upon n-3 PUFA supplementation. Therefore, we should exercise caution with n-3 PUFA supplementation especially in patients with higher age, CVD, hypertriglyceridemia or diabetes. In summary, existing data argue against the additive intake of n-3 PUFA for preventative purposes because of an incremental AF risk and lacking CVD benefits. However, more clinical studies are required to disentangle the discrepancy between n-3 PUFA RCTs and observational studies showing a lower CVD risk in individuals who regularly consume n-3 PUFA-rich fish.",Herrmann W; Herrmann M,"Diagnosis (Berlin, Germany)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38716687/,1,0,0,0,0,1
38710656,Medication and supplement pharmacokinetic changes following bariatric surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"To evaluate the impact of bariatric surgery on the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of orally administered medications and supplements. Systematic searches of bibliographic databases were conducted to identify studies. Pooled effect estimates from different surgical procedures were calculated using a random-effects model. Quantitative data were synthesized from 58 studies including a total of 1985 participants. Whilst 40 medications and 6 supplements were evaluated across these studies, heterogeneity and missing information reduced the scope of the meta-analysis to the following medications and supplements: atorvastatin, paracetamol, omeprazole, midazolam, vitamin D, calcium, zinc, and iron supplements. There were no significant differences in PK parameters post-surgery for the drugs atorvastatin and omeprazole, and supplements calcium, ferritin, and zinc supplements. Paracetamol showed reduced clearance (mean difference [MD] = -15.56 L/hr, p = 0.0002, I<sup>2</sup> = 67%), increased maximal concentration (MD = 6.90 μg/ml, p = 0.006, I<sup>2</sup> = 92%) and increased terminal elimination half-life (MD = 0.49 hr, p < 0.0001, I<sup>2</sup> = 3%) post-surgery. The remaining 36 medications and 2 supplements were included in a systematic review. Overall, 18 of the 53 drugs and supplements showed post-operative changes in PK parameters. This study demonstrates heterogeneity in practice and could not reach conclusive findings for most PK parameters. Prospective studies are needed to inform best practice and enhance patient healthcare and safety following bariatric surgery.",Lajeunesse-Trempe F; Okroj D; Ostarijas E; Ramalho A; Tremblay EJ; Llewellyn D; Harlow C; Chandhyoke N; Chew NWS; Vincent RP; Tchernof A; Piché ME; Poirier P; Biertho L; Morin MP; Copeland CS; Dimitriadis GK,Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38710656/,0,1,0,1,0,0
38703829,Control compounds for preclinical drug-induced liver injury assessment: Consensus-driven systematic review by the ProEuroDILI network.,"Idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a complex and unpredictable event caused by drugs, and herbal or dietary supplements. Early identification of human hepatotoxicity at preclinical stages remains a major challenge, in which the selection of validated in vitro systems and test drugs has a significant impact. In this systematic review, we analyzed the compounds used in hepatotoxicity assays and established a list of DILI-positive and -negative control drugs for validation of in vitro models of DILI, supported by literature and clinical evidence and endorsed by an expert committee from the COST Action ProEuroDILI Network (CA17112). Following 2020 PRISMA guidelines, original research articles focusing on DILI which used in vitro human models and performed at least one hepatotoxicity assay with positive and negative control compounds, were included. Bias of the studies was assessed by a modified 'Toxicological Data Reliability Assessment Tool'. A total of 51 studies (out of 2,936) met the inclusion criteria, with 30 categorized as reliable without restrictions. Although there was a broad consensus on positive compounds, the selection of negative compounds lacked clarity. 2D monoculture, short exposure times and cytotoxicity endpoints were the most tested, although there was no consensus on drug concentrations. Extensive analysis highlighted the lack of agreement on control compounds for in vitro DILI assessment. Following comprehensive in vitro and clinical data analysis together with input from the expert committee, an evidence-based consensus-driven list of 10 positive and negative control drugs for validation of in vitro models of DILI is proposed. Prediction of human toxicity early in the drug development process remains a major challenge, necessitating the development of more physiologically relevant liver models and careful selection of drug-induced liver injury (DILI)-positive and -negative control drugs to better predict the risk of DILI associated with new drug candidates. Thus, this systematic study has crucial implications for standardizing the validation of new in vitro models of DILI. By establishing a consensus-driven list of positive and negative control drugs, the study provides a scientifically justified framework for enhancing the consistency of preclinical testing, thereby addressing a significant challenge in early hepatotoxicity identification. Practically, these findings can guide researchers in evaluating safety profiles of new drugs, refining in vitro models, and informing regulatory agencies on potential improvements to regulatory guidelines, ensuring a more systematic and efficient approach to drug safety assessment.",Segovia-Zafra A; Villanueva-Paz M; Serras AS; Matilla-Cabello G; Bodoque-García A; Di Zeo-Sánchez DE; Niu H; Álvarez-Álvarez I; Sanz-Villanueva L; Godec S; Milisav I; Bagnaninchi P; Andrade RJ; Lucena MI; Fernández-Checa JC; Cubero FJ; Miranda JP; Nelson LJ,Journal of hepatology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38703829/,0,1,0,0,0,0
38700145,The impact of systemic administration of polyphenols on periodontitis associated with diabetes mellitus: a systematic review.,"The aim of this work was to explore the potential of polyphenol supplement consumption in enhancing the treatment of periodontitis and diabetes mellitus in both diabetic animals and humans. A comprehensive search across eight databases (MEDLINE, EBSCO, Taylor & Francis, PRIMO, Web of Science, Wiley Online Library, ScienceDirect, and SAGE Journals) and two registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and Cochrane Library Trials) was conducted. Methodological quality assessment employed the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for randomised controlled trials and the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation Risk of Bias Tool for experimental animal studies. Ten articles meeting inclusion criteria were identified. Three clinical studies demonstrated significant reductions in probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment loss (CAL). Ginger supplementation showed a decrease in CAL (-0.57 ± 0.50 vs. -0.14 ± 0.35, p = 0.003) and PD (-0.52 ± 0.51 vs. -0.19 ± 0.51, p = 0.04), while resveratrol supplementation exhibited a reduction in PD (-1.1 ± 0.58 vs. -0.6 ± 0.47, p < 0.001). Additionally, cranberry juice supplementation led to a decrease in PD (-0.56 ± 0.03, p < 0.001). However, there was no significant improvement in inflammation status. Although polyphenol supplementation did not impact fasting blood glucose levels, it did result in improved insulin resistance (3.66 ± 0.97 vs. 4.49 ± 1.56, p = 0.045). In diabetic animals, six studies reported a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in bone loss along with marked improvements in inflammation status. Despite the promising results observed in the included studies, the overall evidence supporting the positive effects of polyphenols on periodontal and diabetes mellitus status, along with their anti-inflammatory properties, remains inadequate.",Rogalnikovaite K; Antipoviene A; Burbulyte A; Bendoraitiene EA,Acta odontologica Scandinavica,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38700145/,0,1,0,0,0,0

38688453,Evaluating the efficacy and safety of therapeutic interventions for corneal neuropathy: A systematic review.,"Corneal neuropathy involves corneal nerve damage that disrupts ocular surface integrity, negatively impacting quality-of-life from pain and impaired vision. Any ocular or systemic condition that damages the trigeminal nerve can lead to corneal neuropathy. However, the condition currently does not have standardized diagnostic criteria or treatment protocols. The primary aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of interventions for treating corneal neuropathy. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated corneal neuropathy treatments were eligible if the intervention(s) was compared to a placebo or active comparator. Comprehensive searches were conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase and clinical trial registries from inception to July 2022. The Cochrane Risk-of-Bias 2 tool was used to assess study methodological quality. Certainty of the body of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Overall, 20 RCTs were included. Evaluated interventions comprised regenerative therapies (n = 6 studies), dietary supplements (n = 4), anti-glycemic agents (n = 3), combination therapy (n = 3), supportive therapies (n = 2) and systemic pain pharmacotherapies (n = 2). Nine RCTs were judged at high risk of bias for most outcomes. Definitions for corneal neuropathy in the populations varied substantially across studies, consistent with lack of consensus on diagnostic criteria. A diverse range of outcomes were quantified, likely reflecting absence of an agreed core outcome set. There was insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions on the efficacy or safety of any intervention. There was low or very low certainty evidence for several neuroregenerative agents and dietary supplements for improving corneal nerve fiber length in corneal neuropathy due to dry eye disease and diabetes. Low or very low certainty evidence was found for neuroregenerative therapies and dietary supplements not altering corneal immune cell density. This review identifies a need to standardize the clinical definition of corneal neuropathy and define a minimum set of core outcome measures. Together, this will provide a foundation for improved phenotyping of clinical populations in studies, and improve the capacity to synthesize data to inform evidence-based care.

38676520,"Phytochemicals, Herbal Extracts, and Dietary Supplements for Metabolic Disease Management.","Comprehensive and effective care techniques have become essential due to the global epidemic dimensions of metabolic disorders, including diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular ailments. Recent research highlights the potential of dietary supplements, herbal extracts, and phytochemicals in treating metabolic diseases. This abstract conveys the current state of the science in this field by highlighting these findings' underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic applications. Plant-based diets contain naturally occurring bioactive molecules termed phytochemicals, which have shown promise in treating various metabolic illnesses. Examples include curcumin, flavonoids, and polyphenols' insulin-sensitizing, antioxidant, and antiinflammatory properties. Herbal extracts, derived from ancient medicinal herbs, have been used by people for years to treat a wide range of ailments. Recent studies have shown the efficacy of these strategies in improving lipid profiles, glucose metabolism, and overall cardiovascular health. Omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals are just a few of the numerous nutritional supplements that are critical to metabolic health. These vitamins improve insulin sensitivity, regulate blood sugar, and decrease inflammation. Probiotics and prebiotics also affect the gut flora, which significantly affects metabolic function. These natural medicines' ability to treat metabolic diseases either by themselves or in combination with conventional medical interventions. However, when using it therapeutically, one must consider the differences in doses, individual responses, and bioavailability. The article concludes that phytochemicals, plant extracts, and food supplements offer a promising avenue for the management of metabolic illnesses. Comprehensive research, including clinical studies, is needed to ascertain their safety and efficacy characteristics. When added to treatment strategies, these natural therapies could be helpful supplements that improve overall health and the quality of life among individuals with metabolic diseases. Naringenin, a citrus flavonoid, can potentially prevent kidney injury in hyperuricemia by reducing uric acid, inflammation, apoptosis, DNA damage, and activating antioxidants. Further research and professional consultation are essential. Factors contributing to metabolic diseases, current approaches to management nutritional approaches for managing obesityassociated metabolic impairments in the liver and small intestine, and nutritional approaches for managing obesity-associated metabolic dysregulation are also explained briefly.",Halagali P; Inamdar A; Singh J; Anand A; Sadhu P; Pathak R; Sharma H; Biswas D,"Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38676520/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38676509,Probiotic Supplementation during Pregnancy: Evaluating the Current Clinical Evidence against Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) constitutes a common metabolic disorder that could lead to deleterious short- and long-term complications in both the mother and her infant. Probiotic supplementation seems to exert diverse, healthy effects by acting as a preventive agent against various human diseases, including GDM. The purpose of the current narrative review was to critically summarize and scrutinize the available clinical studies during the last 15 years (2008-2023) concerning the use of probiotic supplementation during pregnancy as a protecting agent against GDM. A thorough and in-depth search was performed in the most accurate scientific databases, e.g., PubMed., Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar applying effective, and relevant keywords. There are currently some clinical studies suggesting the potential beneficial impact of probiotic supplementation in the prevention and/or co-treatment of GDM. Nevertheless, there is a high heterogeneity amongst the available clinical studies concerning the dosage, the administration duration, the probiotic species types, the method designs and protocols, and the study populations. Probiotic supplementation at conventional dosages and in combination with a balanced healthy diet, and lifestyle seems to reduce the the risk of developing GDM, while ameliorating the severity of its symptoms. Further clinical studies taking into account the above considerations should be performed to establish conclusive results, while the future meta-analyses should include studies with the feasibly lowest heterogeneity.",Pavlidou E; Alexatou O; Tsourouflis G; Antasouras G; Papadopoulou SK; Papandreou D; Sampani A; Giaginis C,Current diabetes reviews,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38676509/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38676447,"Consensus Statement on Vitamin D Status Assessment and Supplementation: Whys, Whens, and Hows.","The 6th International Conference, ""Controversies in Vitamin D,"" was convened to discuss controversial topics, such as vitamin D metabolism, assessment, actions, and supplementation. Novel insights into vitamin D mechanisms of action suggest links with conditions that do not depend only on reduced solar exposure or diet intake and that can be detected with distinctive noncanonical vitamin D metabolites. Optimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels remain debated. Varying recommendations from different societies arise from evaluating different clinical or public health approaches. The lack of assay standardization also poses challenges in interpreting data from available studies, hindering rational data pooling and meta-analyses. Beyond the well-known skeletal features, interest in vitamin D's extraskeletal effects has led to clinical trials on cancer, cardiovascular risk, respiratory effects, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, and mortality. The initial negative results are likely due to enrollment of vitamin D-replete individuals. Subsequent post hoc analyses have suggested, nevertheless, potential benefits in reducing cancer incidence, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular events, and diabetes. Oral administration of vitamin D is the preferred route. Parenteral administration is reserved for specific clinical situations. Cholecalciferol is favored due to safety and minimal monitoring requirements. Calcifediol may be used in certain conditions, while calcitriol should be limited to specific disorders in which the active metabolite is not readily produced in vivo. Further studies are needed to investigate vitamin D effects in relation to the different recommended 25(OH)D levels and the efficacy of the different supplementary formulations in achieving biochemical and clinical outcomes within the multifaced skeletal and extraskeletal potential effects of vitamin D.",Giustina A; Bilezikian JP; Adler RA; Banfi G; Bikle DD; Binkley NC; Bollerslev J; Bouillon R; Brandi ML; Casanueva FF; di Filippo L; Donini LM; Ebeling PR; Fuleihan GE; Fassio A; Frara S; Jones G; Marcocci C; Martineau AR; Minisola S; Napoli N; Procopio M; Rizzoli R; Schafer AL; Sempos CT; Ulivieri FM; Virtanen JK,Endocrine reviews,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38676447/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38667785,Seaweeds as Nutraceutical Elements and Drugs for Diabetes Mellitus: Future Perspectives.,"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic condition marked by high blood glucose levels caused by inadequate insulin synthesis or poor insulin use. This condition affects millions of individuals worldwide and is linked to a variety of consequences, including cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy. Diabetes therapy now focuses on controlling blood glucose levels through lifestyle changes, oral medicines, and insulin injections. However, these therapies have limits and may not successfully prevent or treat diabetic problems. Several marine-derived chemicals have previously demonstrated promising findings as possible antidiabetic medicines in preclinical investigations. Peptides, polyphenols, and polysaccharides extracted from seaweeds, sponges, and other marine species are among them. As a result, marine natural products have the potential to be a rich source of innovative multitargeted medications for diabetes prevention and treatment, as well as associated complications. Future research should focus on the chemical variety of marine creatures as well as the mechanisms of action of marine-derived chemicals in order to find new antidiabetic medicines and maximize their therapeutic potential. Based on preclinical investigations, this review focuses on the next step for seaweed applications as potential multitargeted medicines for diabetes, highlighting the bioactivities of seaweeds in the prevention and treatment of this illness.",Cotas J; Lomartire S; Pereira L; Valado A; Marques JC; Gonçalves AMM,Marine drugs,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38667785/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Consistently, vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased incidence of various diseases, including type 1 and type 2 diabetes, as reported by many observational studies. However, there has been no consensus on whether vitamin D deficiency is a causative factor in the incidence of diabetes mellitus. There have been no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed at preventing the onset of type 1 diabetes with vitamin D intake. In addition, the results of RCTs evaluating the preventive effect of vitamin D supplementation on type 2 diabetes development have been inconsistent. The recent observational studies, randomized controlled trials, and meta-analyses are confirming that vitamin D or active vitamin D administration is effective in preventing the incident of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.",Kawahara T; Okada Y; Tanaka Y,Journal of bone and mineral metabolism,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38664254/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38649347,Folic acid supplementation on inflammation and homocysteine in type 2 diabetes mellitus: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"The beneficial effects of folate have been observed under different conditions, but the available evidence on inflammation and reduction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is limited. The study aimed to explore the effects of folate on inflammation and homocysteine amongst individuals with T2DM. PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library were used to search for evidence. A random-effect model meta-analysis through Review Manager (version 5.4) and metaHun was performed. Results were reported as standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals graphically using forest and funnel plots. Data from 9 trials with 426 patients living with T2DM were analyzed. Folic acid supplementation significantly revealed a large effect size on homocysteine levels compared to placebo, SMD = -1.53, 95%CI (-2.14,-0.93), p < 0.05. Additionally, we observed a medium marginal effect size on C-reactive protein (SMD = -0.68, 95%CI (-1.34, -0.01), p = 0.05). However, no significant effect on tumor necrosis factor-α (SMD = -0.86, 95%CI (-2.65, 0.93), p = 0.34), and interleukin-6 (SMD = -0.04, 95%CI (-1.08, 1.01), p = 0.95) was observed. Evidence analyzed in this study suggests that folic acid supplementation in T2DM reduces homocysteine and may mitigate CVDs. However, its effect on inflammation is inconclusive.",Mokgalaboni K; Mashaba GR; Phoswa WN; Lebelo SL,Nutrition & diabetes,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38649347/,0,1,0,1,0,0
38648171,Nutrition: Malnutrition and Dietary Intake Modification.,"The average adult needs 1 to 2 g protein/kg of body weight and 25 to 30 kcal/kg of body weight per day. Caloric needs in adults differ based on height, weight, activity level, and disease state. Malnutrition is defined as an imbalance of nutrition, including lack of adequate calories, protein, and/or other nutrients required for body functioning. Protein-calorie malnutrition is a specific type of malnutrition defined as deficient intake or uptake of protein and energy that leads to physiologic alterations such as inflammation, loss in fat-free mass, and/or decreased response to medical treatment. Worldwide, 20% to 50% of hospitalized patients have malnutrition preadmission, and up to 90% of older adult patients are at increased risk. All patients should be screened for malnutrition within 24 hours of hospital admission. If malnutrition is suspected in the outpatient setting, patients should be screened with assistance from a registered dietitian nutritionist. The treatment strategy for protein and calorie supplementation involves provision of additional calories via oral nutritional supplements, enteral tube feedings, or parenteral nutrition. Oral nutritional supplements are indicated for patients with mild cases of malnutrition who are able to consume food orally. Meal replacement products are a convenient way to modify macronutrient intake, including use as a temporary solution to increase intake in patients with malnutrition and as an intervention for weight loss.",England E; Cheng C,FP essentials,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38648171/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38648170,Nutrition: Micronutrients.,"Micronutrients are nutrients the body needs in small quantities, such as vitamins and minerals. Micronutrient deficiencies can occur when an individual is restricting calorie intake for weight loss or management, not consuming an adequate amount of food to meet energy requirements due to poor appetite or illness, eliminating one or more food groups from the diet on a regular basis, or consuming a diet low in micronutrient-rich foods despite adequate or excessive energy intake. Patient groups at risk include older adults, pregnant patients, patients with alcohol use disorder, patients with vegetarian or vegan diets, and patients with increased requirements secondary to medical conditions or long-term drug use that alters nutrient absorption, metabolism, or excretion. The micronutrients that most commonly require supplementation are vitamin D, iron, vitamin A, zinc, folate, and iodine. Results of large-scale randomized trials have shown no overall benefit of multivitamins for the majority of patients. However, a daily multivitamin may be beneficial, particularly for patients who do not consistently consume a well-balanced diet. Although dietary supplements can be helpful in correcting deficiencies, higher than recommended doses can cause adverse effects. Patients should be advised to take recommended dosages of supplements and consult their physician if they notice any adverse effects. Physicians should advise patients to consult drug labels and/or pharmacists about potential supplement interactions with drugs or other supplements.",England E; Cheng C,FP essentials,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38648170/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38644711,Alpha-lipoic Acid: An Antioxidant with Anti-aging Properties for Disease Therapy.,"The anti-aging effects of alpha-lipoic acid (αLA), a natural antioxidant synthesized in human tissues, have attracted a growing interest in recent years. αLA is a short- -chain sulfur-containing fatty acid occurring in the mitochondria of all kinds of eukaryotic cells. Both the oxidized disulfide of αLA and its reduced form (dihydrolipoic acid, DHLA) exhibit prominent antioxidant function. The amount of αLA inside the human body gradually decreases with age resulting in various health disorders. Its lack can be compensated by supplying from external sources such as dietary supplements or medicinal dosage forms. The primary objectives of this study were the analysis of updated information on the latest two-decade research regarding the use of αLA from an anti-aging perspective. The information was collected from PubMed, Wiley Online Library, Scopus, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, Google Scholar, and clinicaltrials.gov. Numerous <i>in silico, in vitro, in vivo</i>, and clinical studies revealed that αLA shows a protective role in biological systems by direct or indirect reactive oxygen/nitrogen species quenching. αLA demonstrated beneficial properties in the prevention and treatment of many age-related disorders such as neurodegeneration, metabolic disorders, different cancers, nephropathy, infertility, and skin senescence. Its preventive effects in case of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are of particular interest. Further mechanistic and clinical studies are highly recommended to evaluate the wide spectrum of αLA therapeutic potential that could optimize its dietary intake for prevention and alleviation disorders related to aging.",Shanaida M; Lysiuk R; Mykhailenko O; Hudz N; Abdulsalam A; Gontova T; Oleshchuk O; Ivankiv Y; Shanaida V; Lytkin D; Bjørklund G,Current medicinal chemistry,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38644711/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38630380,Pectin: Health-promoting properties as a natural galectin-3 inhibitor.,"Galectin-3 has a variety of important pathophysiological significance in the human body. Much evidence shows that the abnormal expression of galectin-3 is related to the formation and development of many diseases. Pectin is mostly obtained from processed citrus fruits and apples and is a known natural inhibitor of galactin-3. A large number of peels produced each year are discarded, and it is necessary to recycle some of the economically valuable active compounds in these by-products to reduce resource waste and environmental pollution. By binding with galectin-3, pectin can directly reduce the expression level of galectin-3 on the one hand, and regulate the expression level of cytokines by regulating certain signaling pathways on the other hand, to achieve the effect of treating diseases. This paper begins by presenting an overview of the basic structure of pectin, subsequently followed by a description of the structure of galectin-3 and its detrimental impact on human health when expressed abnormally. The health effects of pectin as a galectin-3 inhibitor were then summarized from the perspectives of anticancer, anti-inflammatory, ameliorating fibrotic diseases, and anti-diabetes. Finally, the challenges and prospects of future research on pectin are presented, which provide important references for expanding the application of pectin in the pharmaceutical industry or developing functional dietary supplements.",An L; Chang G; Zhang L; Wang P; Gao W; Li X,Glycoconjugate journal,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38630380/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We also review the scientific literature for their potential mechanisms and laboratory test changes triggered by their use. Based on the analysis of existing data on substances used to increase endogenous T levels, especially double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials, we selected 2 herbal extracts with the best documented positive effects on T levels, Withania somnifera root and root extracts/leaves and seed extracts of Trigonella foenum-graecum. Although these substances have different postulated mechanisms of action, both significantly increase T levels in men. Withania somnifera may inhibit the effects of cortisol and prolactin on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and directly affect the hypothalamus.

38622882,Role of Synbiotics (Prebiotics and Probiotics) as Dietary Supplements in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Induced Health Complications.,"Diabetes is a metabolic disorder whose prevalence has become a worrying condition in recent decades. Chronic diabetes can result in serious health conditions such as impaired kidney function, stroke, blindness, and myocardial infarction. Despite a variety of currently available treatments, cases of diabetes and its complications are on the rise. This review article provides a comprehensive account of the ameliorative effect of prebiotics and probiotics individually or in combination i.e. synbiotics on health complications induced by Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Recent advances in the field underscore encouraging outcomes suggesting the consumption of synbiotics leads to favorable changes in the gut microbiota. These changes result in the production of bioactive metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (crucial for lowering blood sugar levels), reducing inflammation, preventing insulin resistance, and encouraging the release of glucagon-like peptide-1 in the host. Notably, novel strategies supplementing synbiotics to support gut microbiota are gaining attraction as pivotal interventions in mitigating T2DM-induced health complications. Thus, by nurturing a symbiotic relationship between prebiotics and probiotics i.e. synbiotics, these interventions hold promise in reshaping the microbial landscape of the gut thereby offering a multifaceted approach to managing T2DM and its associated morbidities. Supporting the potential of synbiotics underscores a paradigm shift toward holistic and targeted interventions in diabetes management, offering prospects for improved outcomes and enhanced quality of life for affected individuals. Nevertheless, more research needs to be done to better understand the single and multispecies pre/pro and synbiotics in the prevention and management of T2DM-induced health complications.",Baghel K; Khan A; Kango N,Journal of dietary supplements,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38622882/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38612462,Exploring the Impact of Alternative Sources of Dietary Nitrate Supplementation on Exercise Performance.,"An increase in the level of nitric oxide (NO) plays a key role in regulating the human cardiovascular system (lowering blood pressure, improving blood flow), glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, and may help enhance exercise capacity in healthy individuals (including athletes). This molecule is formed by endogenous enzymatic synthesis and the intake of inorganic nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) from dietary sources. Although one of the most well-known natural sources of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in the daily diet is beetroot (<i>Beta vulgaris</i>), this review also explores other plant sources of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> with comparable concentrations that could serve as ergogenic aids, supporting exercise performance or recovery in healthy individuals. The results of the analysis demonstrate that red spinach (<i>Amaranthus</i> spp.) and green spinach (<i>Spinacia oleracea</i>) are alternative natural sources rich in dietary NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. The outcomes of the collected studies showed that consumption of selected alternative sources of inorganic NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> could support physical condition. Red spinach and green spinach have been shown to improve exercise performance or accelerate recovery after physical exertion in healthy subjects (including athletes).",Jędrejko M; Jędrejko K; Gómez-Renaud VM; Kała K; Muszyńska B,International journal of molecular sciences,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38612462/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38594107,"The Effects of L-Carnitine Supplementation on Weight Loss, Glycemic Control, and Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Dose-response Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.","L-carnitine supplementation has been recommended to improve cardiometabolic health markers in diabetic patients. Our purpose was to assess the dose-dependent effects of l-carnitine supplementation on cardiometabolic risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes. PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched until May 2022 for randomized controlled trials that examined the impact of l-carnitine supplementation on cardiometabolic risk factors in adults with type 2 diabetes. The mean difference (MD) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated utilizing a random-effects model. Nonlinear dose-response associations were modeled with restricted cubic splines. The certainty of evidence was rated using the GRADE approach. Twenty-one randomized trials with 2041 patients with type 2 diabetes were included. We found that every 1 g/d supplementation with l-carnitine significantly reduced body mass index (MD: -0.37 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95% CI: -0.59, -0.15; I<sup>2</sup> =93%, n=13, GRADE=low), HbA<sub>1c</sub> (MD: -0.16%, 95% CI: -0.32, -0.01; I<sup>2</sup> = 94%, n = 18, GRADE = moderate), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD: -0.11 mmol/L, 95% CI: -0.16, -0.05; I<sup>2</sup> = 91%, n = 11, GRADE = high). There were also reductions in serum triglycerides (MD: 0.07 mmol/L), total cholesterol (MD: -0.13 mmol/L), and fasting plasma glucose (MD: -0.17 mmol/L). A U-shaped effect was demonstrated for body mass index, with the largest reduction at 2 g/d. A linear reduction was seen for serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, and fasting plasma glucose up to l-carnitine supplementation of 4 g/d. L-carnitine supplementation resulted in a small reduction in serum lipids and plasma glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes.

38553998,The effect of pomegranate juice supplementation on C-reactive protein levels: GRADE-assessed systematic review and dose-response updated meta-analysis of data from randomized controlled trials.,"Pomegranate juice (PJ) has a possible anti-inflammatory effect because of its polyphenol content and antioxidants. However, the anti-inflammatory effect of PJ in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) has not been consistent. A previous meta-analysis conducted in 2016 reported a nonsignificant lowering effect of PJ on C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to update the pooled effect size of PJ supplementation on CRP levels in RCT studies. PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were comprehensively searched until July 2023. Eligible studies were found by screening, their relevant data was extracted, and a risk of bias assessment was performed. The pooled effect size was calculated using a random effect model as the weighted mean difference (WMD) with a 95% confidence interval. This systematic review included 11 studies with 13 effect sizes and 696 participants. Meta-analysis showed that PJ supplementation led to a significant decrease in CRP levels compared to control groups (WMD: -2.55 mg/L; 95%CI: -3.44 to -1.66; p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis demonstrated the significant reduction effect of PJ on CRP levels in studies conducted on the both sexes or only females as well as Iranian population, individuals with 40 years≤, type 2 diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, or trials that intervened with PJ dosage of <250 ml/day. Meta-regression and dose-response analysis reported a nonsignificant linear and nonlinear relationship between intervention characteristics (duration and dose of PJ) and CRP changes. The current meta-analysis revealed that PJ supplemantation has a beneficial effect in improving CRP levels. It is recommended to understand this effect better, and find the optimal dose and duration of PJ supplementation to reduce CRP levels in the blood, and repeat meta-analysis after related RCTs are available. For the final proof of these effects, more detailed human studies are needed.",Jazinaki MS; Rashidmayvan M; Pahlavani N,Phytotherapy research : PTR,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38553998/,0,1,0,1,0,0
38542818,Nutritional Management of Athletes with Type 1 Diabetes: A Narrative Review.,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) represents a complex clinical challenge for health systems. The autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells leads to a complete lack of insulin production, exposing people to a lifelong risk of acute (DKA, coma) and chronic complications (macro and microvascular). Physical activity (PA) has widely demonstrated its efficacy in helping diabetes treatment. Nutritional management of people living with T1DM is particularly difficult. Balancing macronutrients, their effects on glycemic control, and insulin treatment represents a complex clinical challenge for the diabetologist. The effects of PA on glycemic control are largely unpredictable depending on many individual factors, such as intensity, nutrient co-ingestion, and many others. Due to this clinical complexity, we have reviewed the actual scientific literature in depth to help diabetologists, sport medicine doctors, nutritionists, and all the health figures involved in diabetes care to ameliorate both glycemic control and the nutritional status of T1DM people engaging in PA. Two electronic databases (PubMed and Scopus) were searched from their inception to January 2024.

38542782,Functional and Therapeutic Potential of <i>Cynara scolymus</i> in Health Benefits.,"Dietary supplements enriched with bioactive compounds represent a promising approach to influence physiological processes and enhance longevity and overall health. <i>Cynara cardunculus</i> var. <i>scolymus</i> serves as a functional food supplement with a high concentration of bioactive compounds, which offers various health-promoting benefits. Several chronic diseases have metabolic, genetic, or inflammatory origins, which are frequently interconnected. Pharmacological treatments, although effective, often result in undesirable side effects. In this context, preventive approaches are gaining increased attention. Recent literature indicates that the consumption of bioactive compounds in the diet can positively influence the organism's biological functions. Polyphenols, well-known for their health benefits, are widely recognized as valuable compounds in preventing/combating various pathologies related to lifestyle, metabolism, and aging. The <i>C. scolymus</i> belonging to the Asteraceae family, is widely used in the food and herbal medicine fields for its beneficial properties. Although the inflorescences (capitula) of the artichoke are used for food and culinary purposes, preparations based on artichoke leaves can be used as an active ingredient in herbal medicines. <i>Cynara scolymus</i> shows potential benefits in different domains. Its nutritional value and health benefits make it a promising candidate for improving overall well-being. <i>C. scolymus</i> exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, liver-protective, bile-expelling, antimicrobial, and lipid-lowering neuroprotective properties. Different studies demonstrate that oxidative stress is the leading cause of the onset and progression of major human health disorders such as cardiovascular, neurological, metabolic, and cancer diseases. The large amount of polyphenol found in <i>C. scolymus</i> has an antioxidant activity, enabling it to neutralize free radicals, preventing cellular damage. This reduces the subsequent risk of developing conditions such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, these polyphenols demonstrate anti-inflammatory activity, which is closely associated with their antioxidant properties. As a result, <i>C. scolymus</i> has the potential to contribute to the treatment of chronic diseases, including intestinal disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative pathologies.

38534764,"Bioconversion, Pharmacokinetics, and Therapeutic Mechanisms of Ginsenoside Compound K and Its Analogues for Treating Metabolic Diseases.","Rare ginsenoside compound K (CK) is an intestinal microbial metabolite with a low natural abundance that is primarily produced by physicochemical processing, side chain modification, or metabolic transformation in the gut. Moreover, CK exhibits potent biological activity compared to primary ginsenosides, which has raised concerns in the field of ginseng research and development, as well as ginsenoside-related dietary supplements and natural products. Ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, and Rc are generally used as a substrate to generate CK via several bioconversion processes. Current research shows that CK has a wide range of pharmacological actions, including boosting osteogenesis, lipid and glucose metabolism, lipid oxidation, insulin resistance, and anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptosis properties. Further research on the bioavailability and toxicology of CK can advance its medicinal application. The purpose of this review is to lay the groundwork for future clinical studies and the development of CK as a therapy for metabolic disorders. Furthermore, the toxicology and pharmacology of CK are investigated as well in this review. The findings indicate that CK primarily modulates signaling pathways associated with <i>AMPK</i>, <i>SIRT1</i>, <i>PPARs</i>, <i>WNTs</i>, and <i>NF-kB</i>. It also demonstrates a positive therapeutic effect of CK on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), obesity, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and its complications, as well as osteoporosis.

38522145,Nutrition of aging people with diabetes mellitus: Focus on sarcopenia.,"As populations age, chronic diseases accumulate, and new health conditions emerge. One noteworthy pair that warrants further evaluation is diabetes mellitus and sarcopenia, given that the latter occurs in 28 % of the population aged over 50 who have diabetes mellitus. The management of both entails nutritional interventions, making the development of unified dietary recommendations an alluring strategy. This review aims to elucidate the current recommendations for the combined management of sarcopenia and diabetes, while featuring elements that require further research. The goal of nutritional management is to improve muscle mass and strength while regulating metabolic risk and glucose levels. To ensure muscle synthesis in the elderly, recommendations align at daily calorie intake that exceeds 30 kcal/kg, with adjustments based on comorbidities. Additionally, a protein intake of at least 1-1.2 g/kg/d is essential, emphasizing both daily and per-meal intake, and can be achieved through diet or branched-amino-acids supplements. Specific considerations for diabetes include restricted protein intake in diabetic nephropathy and exploring the potential link between branched amino acids and insulin resistance. Further recommendations that both promote metabolic health and have demonstrated at least a potential to increase muscle strength include prioritizing polyunsaturated fatty acids as a fat source and maintaining adequate levels of vitamin D. Clinicians should consult their patients on dietary optimization, but evidence is insufficient to recommend additional supplementation. Lastly, an emerging challenge of diabetes and sarcopenia is sarcopenic obesity, which requires the combination of a hypocaloric diet with increased protein intake.",Shalit A; Gerontiti E; Boutzios G; Korakianiti E; Kanouta F; Vasileiou V; Psaltopoulou T; Paschou SA,Maturitas,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38522145/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38519764,"Diet, exercise, and supplements: what is their role in the management of the metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in children?","Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), previously known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is the main cause of chronic liver disease in children and adolescents. Indeed, epidemiological studies have shown that MASLD affects up to 40% of children with obesity. Despite the recent approval of medications that target weight loss in adolescents that could have benefits on pediatric MASLD, lifestyle interventions, such as diet and exercise, remain the mainstay of our therapeutic approach. More specifically, studies on diet alone have focused on the possible role of carbohydrate or fat restriction, albeit without a definite answer on the best approach. Weight loss after dietary intervention in children with obesity and MASLD has a beneficial effect, regardless of the diet used. In relation to the role of exercise in MASLD reversal, indirect evidence comes from studies showing that a sedentary lifestyle leading to poor fitness, and low muscle mass is associated with MASLD. However, research on the direct effect of exercise on MASLD in children is scarce. A combination of diet and exercise seems to be beneficial with several studies showing improvement in surrogate markers of MASLD, such as serum alanine aminotransferase and hepatic fat fraction, the latter evaluated with imaging studies. Several dietary supplements, such as vitamin E, probiotics, and omega-3 fatty acid supplements have also been studied in children and adolescents with MASLD, but with equivocal results. This review aims to critically present available data on the effects of lifestyle interventions, including diet, exercise, and dietary supplements, on pediatric MASLD, thus suggesting a frame for future research that could enhance our knowledge on pediatric MASLD management and optimize clinicians' approach to this vexing medical condition.",Serbis A; Polyzos SA; Paschou SA; Siomou E; Kiortsis DN,Endocrine,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38519764/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Among 6190 screened records, 25 prospective observational studies and 15 RCTs were eligible. Inverse associations were found between dietary and circulating antioxidants and T2D (observational studies). The lowest risk was seen at intakes of 70 mg/d of vitamin C (RR: 0.76; CI: 0.61, 0.95), 12 mg/d of vitamin E (RR: 0.72; CI: 0.61, 0.86), and 4 mg/d of β-carotene (RR: 0.78; CI: 0.65, 0.94). Supplementation with vitamin E (RR: 1.01; CI: 0.93, 1.10) or β-carotene (RR: 0.98; CI: 0.90, 1.07) did not have a protective effect on T2D (RCTs), and data on vitamin C supplementation was limited. Regarding insulin resistance, higher dietary vitamin C (RR: 0.85; CI: 0.74, 0.98) and vitamin E supplementation (MD: -0.35; CI: -0.65, -0.06) were associated with a reduced risk. The certainty of evidence was high for the associations between T2D and dietary vitamin E and β-carotene, and low to moderate for other associations. In conclusion, moderate intakes of vitamins C, E, and β-carotene may lower risk of T2D by reducing insulin resistance. Lack of protection with supplementation in RCTs suggests that adequate rather than high intakes may play a role in T2D prevention.

38474817,Vitamin D Supplementation and Recurrence of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo.,"Positional vertigo manifests as a spinning sensation triggered by changes in head position relative to gravity. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is an inner ear disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of positional vertigo. The connection between vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency and the onset and recurrence of BPPV is established. This study aims to assess vitamin D as a recurring factor in BPPV and the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in preventing its recurrence. A comprehensive literature review on the relationship between vitamin D and BPPV recurrence was conducted, searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and article reference lists for studies published from 2020 to 2023. A total of 79 articles were initially identified through the search, with 12 of them being utilized in the study. Recurrence rates for BPPV varied from 13.7% to 23% for studies with follow-up less than 1 year and 13.3% to 65% for studies with follow-up equal to or exceeding 2 years. Risk factors for BPPV recurrence include advanced age, female sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, and vitamin D deficiency. While earlier studies did not establish a link between low vitamin D levels and initial BPPV occurrence, they did associate recurrent episodes with low vitamin D levels. Recent research indicates that vitamin D supplementation in BPPV patients with deficiency or insufficiency decreases both the numbers of relapsing patients and relapses per patient. To validate these findings across diverse populations, further randomized controlled studies with larger cohorts and extended follow-up durations are essential.",Rhim G; Kim MJ,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38474817/,1,0,0,0,0,1
38474769,Beneficial Effects of <i>Spirulina</i> Supplementation in the Management of Cardiovascular Diseases.,"In recent decades, as a result of rising mortality rates due to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), there has been a growing urgency to find alternative approaches to conventional pharmaceutical treatment to prevent the onset of chronic diseases. <i>Arthrospira platensis</i>, commonly known as <i>Spirulina</i>, is a blue-green cyanobacterium, classified as a ""superfood"", used worldwide as a nutraceutical food supplement due to its remarkable nutritional value, lack of toxicity, and therapeutic effects. Several scientific studies have evaluated the cardioprotective role of <i>Spirulina</i>. This article presents a comprehensive review of the therapeutic benefits of <i>Spirulina</i> in improving cardio- and cerebrovascular health. It focuses on the latest experimental and clinical findings to evaluate its antihypertensive, antidiabetic, and antihyperlipidemic properties.

38466959,A Systematic Review Evaluating Cinnamon's Effects on Glucose Utilizing a Ranking System to Assess Bias and Study Quality.,"In the context of diabetes, the use of cinnamon continues to be among the most popular supplements taken by patients for glucose control. To strategically evaluate the available literature comparing various cinnamon species and statistically significant glucose effects after ranking studies based on two tools to assess bias and overall study quality, to clarify cinnamon's role in glucose control. The authors performed a systematic search based upon PRISMA guidelines. The search was conducted utilizing PubMed, AMED, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Medline databases, with the final search performed in September 2022 with restrictions to human subjects and English language. Electronic searches were conducted utilizing the keywords ""diabetes mellitus"" combined with <i>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</i>/<i>Cinnamomum cassia</i>/<i>Cinnamomum verum</i> combined with blood glucose (BG). A second search utilized ""cinnamomum zeylanicum/cinnamomum cassia/cinnamomum verum"" combined with ""blood glucose,"" and a final search utilized ""diabetes mellitus"" combined with ""cinnamon."" Data extraction and ranking of included studies utilizing the risk of bias 2 tool and modified Heyland Methodological Quality Scoring tool were performed independently by two review authors. These authors compared their results and reconciled any differences in scoring to generate a final ranking of studies. A third author was available for any discrepancies that could not be resolved but was not needed. Forty-five studies were included in the review and were scored for bias and quality. Overall 62% demonstrated statistical significance for positive effects in at least one parameter around BG control. Applying the ranking systems reduced the percentage closer to 50%. Safety was extremely well documented across studies with few adverse effects. Results are limited by heterogeneity of glucose parameters, leading to studies being ranked individually and not synthesized. Cinnamon supplementation likely has a modest positive effect on BG. Based upon the strong safety profile, utilization of this spice as an adjunct to pharmacologic therapy is reasonable.",Bakhach H; Nuffer M; Tall Bull S; Nuffer W,Journal of medicinal food,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38466959/,0,1,0,0,0,0

A literature search was performed for systematic literature reviews published between January 2018 and February 2023. Forty-two publications were selected for further analysis. This study demonstrates that elevated maternal serum 25(OH)D levels are associated with a decreased risk of preterm labour and various pregnancy-related health issues, highlighting the protective benefits of adequate vitamin D during pregnancy. Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy at a dose of 2,000 IU or higher is preventive for pre-eclampsia, insulin resistance, and the development of bronchial asthma in early childhood. Vitamin D screening is indicated for all pregnant women. Dosages of vitamin D preparations should be determined individually, considering laboratory tests and risk factors.",Kurmangali Z; Abdykalykova B; Kurmangali A; Zhantagulov D; Terzic M,Gynecologic and obstetric investigation,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38461819/,0,1,0,0,0,0
38444046,Long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid intake across the life span for cardiovascular disease prevention in women.,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a major health concern for women. Historically there has been a misconception that men are at greater risk because CVD tends to occur earlier in life compared to women. Clinical guidelines for prevention of heart disease are currently the same for both sexes, but accumulating evidence demonstrates that risk profiles diverge. In fact, several CVD risk factors confer an even greater risk in women relative to men, including high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes and raised triglycerides. Furthermore, many female-specific CVD risk factors exist, including early menarche, pregnancy complications, polycystic ovary syndrome, reproductive hormonal treatments and menopause. Little is known about how diet interacts with CVD risk factors at various stages of a woman’s life. Long chain (LC) n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intakes are a key dietary factor that may impact risk of CVD throughout the life course differentially in men and women. Oestrogen enhances conversion of the plant n-3 PUFA, alpha-linolenic acid, to LCn-3 PUFA. Increasing the frequency of oily fish consumption or LCn-3 PUFA supplementation may be important for reducing coronary risk during the menopausal transition, during which time oestrogen levels decline and the increase in CVD risk factors is accelerated. Women are under-represented in the evidence base for CVD prevention following LC n-3 PUFA supplementation. Therefore it is not clear whether there are sex differences in response to treatment. Furthermore, there is a lack of evidence on optimal intakes of LC n-3 PUFA across the lifespan for CVD prevention in women.",Hall WL,The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38444046/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38433010,Effects and safety of resveratrol supplementation in older adults: A comprehensive systematic review.,"Resveratrol (RSV) has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its potential benefits against chronic diseases. However, its effects and safety in older adults have not been comprehensively studied. This study aimed to determine the effects and safety of RSV supplementation in older adults. MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were comprehensively searched for eligible studies. Studies were enrolled if they were randomized clinical trials and had incorporated RSV supplementation for older adults. Two independent authors conducted the literature search, and eligibility was determined according to the PICOS framework. Study details, intervention specifics, and relevant outcomes were collected during the data collection. The Cochrane RoB-2 tool was used to evaluate the risk of bias. This review included 10 studies. The combination of RSV and exercise improved exercise adaptation and muscle function in healthy older adults and physical performance and mobility measures in individuals with functional limitations. RSV showed potential neuroprotective effects in patients with Alzheimer's disease. In overweight individuals, RSV demonstrated a positive impact on cognitive function, but it increased some biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk at high doses. In older adults with diabetes and those with peripheral artery disease (PAD), RSV was not more effective than placebo. No study reported significant adverse events following RSV treatment. RSV can improve various health parameters in age-related health conditions. However, the optimal dosage, long-term effects, and potential interactions with medications still need to be investigated through well-designed RCTs.",Yadegar S; Mohammadi F; Yadegar A; Mohammadi Naeini A; Ayati A; Milan N; Tayebi A; Seyedi SA; Nabipoorashrafi SA; Rabizadeh S; Esteghamati A; Nakhjavani M,Phytotherapy research : PTR,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38433010/,0,1,0,0,0,0
38415443,Exploring the Potential Benefits of Bovine Colostrum Supplementation in the Management of Diabetes and its Complications: A Comprehensive Review.,"Diabetes is a metabolic illness marked by elevated levels of glucose in the bloodstream due to the inadequate production or use of insulin in the body. Diabetes can result in a range of consequences, with the most prevalent being cardiovascular disease, renal failure, vision loss, and limb removal. Natural compounds isolated from different sources, like colostrum, are the most important compounds for the treatment of diabetes. Colostrum is a form of lactation produced by mammals in the first days after giving birth to their offspring, having a rich source of constituents and showing multipharmacological properties. This review was prepared on the basis of a variety of authoritative search databases, including Google Scholar, Scopus, and PubMed. In addition, the publications and other online sources were also included. In the literature search, the terms ""colostrum,"" ""diabetes,"" ""uses,"" ""management,"" ""constituent,"" ""composition,"" ""alternative sources,"" ""mechanism of action,"" ""preclinical,"" ""clinical,"" ""marketed formulations,"" and ""patents"" were utilized as keywords and collected from last two decades. Colostrum has been utilized as a treatment for a wide variety of illnesses due to its active constituents. A variety of colostrums are available in the market, like goat colostrum, porcine colostrum, sheep colostrum, human colostrum and many more. They have the full potential of nutrients like minerals, vitamins, lactose, essential enzymes, proteins and high concentrations of immunoproteins. Mostly, the colostrums are used for treating diabetes and its complications. Preclinical and clinical studies of metabolic syndrome, especially on diabetes and its complications, were also reported at the National and International levels, which evidently prove that the use of colostrums in the long term can be beneficial for various ailments associated with diabetes. In general, the findings of this review indicate that supplementation with colostrum may hold promise as a novel therapeutic intervention for people who have diabetes and its complications; however, additional research is required to fully understand its mechanisms of action and determine the best possible dosage as well as the time period of supplementation.",Chawla I; Dhanawat M; Sharma M; Gupta S,Current diabetes reviews,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38415443/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38372848,The effects of silymarin consumption on inflammation and oxidative stress in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Owing to the rich phytochemical content of Silymarin, it may effectively manage inflammation and oxidative stress. We, therefore, aimed to examine the existing evidence on the effect of Silymarin consumption on inflammation and oxidative stress factors by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. A systematic literature search up to September 2023 was completed in PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science, to identify eligible RCTs. Heterogeneity tests of the selected trials were performed using the I<sup>2</sup> statistic. Random effects models were assessed based on the heterogeneity tests, and pooled data were determined as weighted mean differences with a 95% confidence interval. Fifteen RCTs were included in this meta-analysis. Our findings showed that Silymarin consumption significantly decreased CRP (WMD, - 0.50 mg/L; 95% CI, (- 0.95 to - 0.04); p = 0.03), MDA (WMD, - 1.19 nmol/mL; 95% CI, (- 1.99 to - 0.38); p = 0.004), and IL-6 (WMD, - 0.44 pg/ml; 95% CI, (- 0.75 to - 0.12); p = 0.006). Silymarin consumption had no significant effects on IL-10, TAC, and GSH. A significant non-linear relationship was observed between the duration of the intervention and MDA changes. Silymarin can help reduce inflammation in patients with diabetes and thalassemia by reducing MDA as an oxidative stress marker and CRP and IL-6 as inflammatory markers.",Bahari H; Shahraki Jazinaki M; Rashidmayvan M; Taheri S; Amini MR; Malekahmadi M,Inflammopharmacology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38372848/,0,1,0,1,0,0
38345088,Nutritional interventions for preventing and treating pressure ulcers.,"Pressure ulcers are localized injuries to the skin or the underlying tissue, or both, and are common in older and immobile people, people with diabetes, vascular disease, or malnutrition, as well as those who require intensive or palliative care. People with pressure ulcers often suffer from severe pain and exhibit social avoidance behaviours. The prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers involves strategies to optimize hydration, circulation, and nutrition. Adequate nutrient intake can reduce the risk factor of malnutrition and promote wound healing in existing pressure ulcers. However, it is unclear which nutrients help prevent and treat pressure ulcers. This is an update of an earlier Cochrane Review. To evaluate the benefits and harms of nutritional interventions (special diets, supplements) for preventing and treating pressure ulcers in people with or without existing pressure ulcers compared to standard diet or other nutritional interventions. We used extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search was in May 2022. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in people with or without existing pressure ulcers, that compared nutritional interventions aimed at preventing or treating pressure ulcers with standard diet or other types of nutritional interventions. We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcome for prevention studies was the proportion of participants who developed new (incident) pressure ulcers. For treatment studies, our primary outcomes were time to complete pressure ulcer healing, number of people with healed pressure ulcers, size and depth of pressure ulcers, and rate of pressure ulcer healing. Secondary outcomes were side effects, costs, health-related quality of life and acceptability. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome. We included 33 RCTs with 7920 participants. Data for meta-analysis were available from 6993 participants. Pressure ulcer prevention Eleven studies (with 12 arms) compared six types of nutritional interventions for the prevention of pressure ulcers. Compared to standard diet, energy, protein and micronutrient supplements may result in little to no difference in the proportion of participants developing a pressure ulcer (energy, protein and micronutrient supplements 248 per 1000, standard diet 269 per 1000; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.19; 3 studies, 1634 participants; low-certainty evidence). Compared to standard diet, protein supplements may result in little to no difference in pressure ulcer incidence (protein 21 per 1000, standard diet 28 per 1000; RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.14; 4 studies, 4264 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the gastrointestinal side effects of these supplements (protein 109 per 1000, standard diet 155 per 1000; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.06 to 7.96; 2 studies, 140 participants, very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of protein, arginine, zinc and antioxidants; L-carnitine, L-leucine, calcium, magnesium and vitamin D; EPA, GLA and antioxidants; disease-specific supplements on pressure ulcer incidence when compared to standard diet (1 study each; very low-certainty evidence for all comparisons). Pressure ulcer treatment Twenty-four studies (with 27 arms) compared 10 types of nutritional interventions or supplements for treatment of pressure ulcers. Compared to standard diet, energy, protein and micronutrient supplements may slightly increase the number of healed pressure ulcers (energy, protein and micronutrients 366 per 1000, standard diet 253 per 1000; RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.85; 3 studies, 577 participants, low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of these supplements on gastrointestinal side effects. Compared to standard diet, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of protein, arginine, zinc and antioxidant supplements on pressure ulcer healing (pressure ulcer area: mean difference (MD) 2 cm² smaller, 95% CI 4.54 smaller to 0.53 larger; 2 studies, 71 participants, very low-certainty evidence). The evidence on side effects of these supplements is very uncertain. Compared to standard diet, supplements with arginine and micronutrients may not increase the number of healed pressure ulcers, but the evidence suggests a slight reduction in pressure ulcer area (MD 15.8% lower, 95% CI 25.11 lower to 6.48 lower; 2 studies, 231 participants, low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about changes in pressure ulcer scores, acceptability, and side effects of these supplements. Compared to placebo, collagen supplements probably improve the mean change in pressure ulcer area (MD 1.81 cm² smaller, 95% CI 3.36 smaller to 0.26 smaller; 1 study, 74 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of these supplements on side effects. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of vitamin C, different doses of arginine; EPA, GLA (special dietary fatty acids) and antioxidants; protein; a specialized amino acid mixture; ornithine alpha-ketoglutarate and zinc supplements on pressure ulcer healing (1 or 2 studies each; very low-certainty evidence). The benefits of nutritional interventions with various compositions for pressure ulcer prevention and treatment are uncertain. There may be little or no difference compared to standard nutrition or placebo. Nutritional supplements may not increase gastrointestinal side effects, but the evidence is very uncertain. Larger studies with similar nutrient compositions would reduce these uncertainties. No study investigated the effects of special diets (e.g. protein-enriched diet, vegetarian diet) on pressure ulcer incidence and healing.",Langer G; Wan CS; Fink A; Schwingshackl L; Schoberer D,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38345088/,0,1,0,1,0,0
38337675,The Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis in Metabolic Syndrome and Sleep Disorders: A Systematic Review.,"Over recent decades, a growing body of evidence has emerged linking the composition of the gut microbiota to sleep regulation. Interestingly, the prevalence of sleep disorders is commonly related to cardiometabolic comorbidities such as diabetes, impaired lipid metabolism, and metabolic syndrome (MetS). In this complex scenario, the role of the gut-brain axis as the main communicating pathway between gut microbiota and sleep regulation pathways in the brain reveals some common host-microbial biomarkers in both sleep disturbances and MetS. As the biological mechanisms behind this complex interacting network of neuroendocrine, immune, and metabolic pathways are not fully understood yet, the present systematic review aims to describe common microbial features between these two unrelated chronic conditions. This systematic review highlights a total of 36 articles associating the gut microbial signature with MetS or sleep disorders. Specific emphasis is given to studies evaluating the effect of dietary patterns, dietary supplementation, and probiotics on MetS or sleep disturbances. Dietary choices promote microbial composition and metabolites, causing both the amelioration and impairment of MetS and sleep homeostasis.",Dos Santos A; Galiè S,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38337675/,0,1,0,0,0,0

The search for effective, relatively easy to maintain body-fat reduction interventions has been ongoing. We aimed to review the current literature to assess the effectiveness of high-intensity interval training with and without dietary supplementation on body fat loss, concentration of markers of metabolic health and aerobic capacity of adults with overweight and obesity. Seventy full-text articles were assessed to determine their eligibility and thirteen were included in the review. The methodology of this systematic review was developed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Almost all studies (93%) demonstrated effectiveness of high-intensity interval training of various protocols in reducing body fat, improving metabolic health and aerobic capacity of adults with overweight and obesity. These effects were enhanced by an addition of a dietary supplement, such as green tea or ginger or other. Although combining HIIT with dietary supplementation seem to improve body composition, metabolic health and aerobic capacity in adults with overweight and obesity in some instances to a greater extent than HIIT alone, it does not seem to be necessary to combine these two interventions.",Gaweł E; Hall B; Siatkowski S; Grabowska A; Zwierzchowska A,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38337640/,0,1,0,0,0,0

The aim of this systematic review was to analyze the effects of fish-oil-capsule supplementation on the glycemic and lipid profiles of pregnant women. A systematic search was conducted of the MEDLINE (by PubMed), Embase, Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) databases and gray literature, including preprints for all relevant studies published in English, with no date restrictions. The estimated pooled results were analyzed using a random-effects model and represented by mean differences (MDs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The analyses were performed with R software, version 4.2.1, using the ""Meta"" packages, versions 6.0-0. Fifteen eligible studies were included after screening. In a pooled analysis, overall fish-oil supplementation had no effect on parameters compared with placebo. In the subgroup analysis, fish-oil supplementation may be beneficial in insulin (MD: -2.11 IU/mL; 95% CI: -3.86, -0.36) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (MD: -0.71; 95% CI: -1.14, -0.29) indices, with heterogeneity (I2 =0%) among pregnant women with diabetes mellitus. In the subgroup with doses of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) below 200 mg, there was a reduction in HOMA-IR in the intervention group (MD: -0.60; 95% CI: -1.14, -0.06).

PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and Embase were searched without any restrictions until September 2023.Only RCTs reporting the effects of sesame supplementation on body composition and lipid profiles were included, while observational studies and animal models were excluded. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Out of 997 studies identified, 10 were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis suggested a significant association between sesame supplementation and reduction in TG (weighted mean difference (WMD): -37.61 mg/dl, 95 % CI: -61.48, 13.73), TC (WMD: -32.69 mg/dl, 95 % CI: -47.26, 18.12), and LDL-C (WMD: -28.72 mg/dl, 95 % CI: -44.68, 12.76). However, our meta-analysis indicated that the supplementary intake of sesame had no significant effect on HDL-C, BW, and BMI in patients with T2DM. This study showed that sesame consumption significantly lowered TG, TC, and LDL-C levels, which may have contributed to the improvement of clinical symptoms in T2DM. However, given the limited number of trials included in the analysis, additional large-scale studies are needed to confirm the effects of sesame consumption on the lipid profile and body composition in patients with T2DM.

38280562,Vitamin D supplementation modulates glycated hemoglobin (HBA1c) in diabetes mellitus.,"Diabetes is a metabolic illness that increases protein glycosylation in hyperglycemic conditions, which can have an impact on almost every organ system in the body. The role of vitamin D in the etiology of diabetes under RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products) stress has recently received some attention on a global scale. Vitamin D's other skeletal benefits have generated a great deal of research. Vitamin D's function in the development of type 1 and type 2 diabetes is supported by the discovery of 1,25 (OH)2D3 and 1-Alpha-Hydroylase expression in immune cells, pancreatic beta cells, and several other organs besides the bone system. A lower HBA1c level, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus all seems to be associated with vitamin D insufficiency. Most of the cross-sectional and prospective observational studies that were used to gather human evidence revealed an inverse relationship between vitamin D level and the prevalence or incidence of elevated HBA1c in type 2 diabetes. Several trials have reported on the impact of vitamin D supplementation for glycemia or incidence of type 2 diabetes, with varying degrees of success. The current paper examines the available data for a relationship between vitamin D supplementation and HBA1c level in diabetes and discusses the biological plausibility of such a relationship.",Akhter A; Alouffi S; Shahab U; Akasha R; Fazal-Ur-Rehman M; Ghoniem ME; Ahmad N; Kaur K; Pandey RP; Alshammari A; Akhter F; Ahmad S,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38280562/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38267976,How quality of life is measured in studies of nutritional intervention: a systematic review.,"Nutrition care can positively affect multiple aspects of patient's health; outcomes are commonly evaluated on the basis of their impact on a patient's (i) illness-specific conditions and (ii) health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Our systematic review examined how HRQoL was measured in studies of nutritional interventions. To help future researchers select appropriate Quality of Life Questionnaires (QoLQ), we identified commonly-used instruments and their uses across populations in different regions, of different ages, and with different diseases. We searched EMCare, EMBASE, and Medline databases for studies that had HRQoL and nutrition intervention terms in the title, the abstract, or the MeSH term classifications ""quality of life"" and any of ""nutrition therapy"", ""diet therapy"", or ""dietary supplements"" and identified 1,113 studies for possible inclusion.We then reviewed titles, abstracts, and full texts to identify studies for final inclusion. Our review of titles, abstracts, and full texts resulted in the inclusion of 116 relevant studies in our final analysis. Our review identified 14 general and 25 disease-specific QoLQ. The most-used general QoLQ were the Short-Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36) in 27 studies and EuroQol 5-Dimension, (EQ-5D) in 26 studies. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ), a cancer-specific QoLQ, was the most frequently used disease-specific QoLQ (28 studies). Disease-specific QoLQ were also identified for nutrition-related diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and dysphagia. Sixteen studies used multiple QoLQ, of which eight studies included both general and disease-specific measures of HRQoL. The most studied diseases were cancer (36 studies) and malnutrition (24 studies). There were few studies focused on specific age-group populations, with only 38 studies (33%) focused on adults 65 years and older and only 4 studies focused on pediatric patients. Regional variation in QoLQ use was observed, with EQ-5D used more frequently in Europe and SF-36 more commonly used in North America.

38254166,Comparison of the efficacy of fish oil and probiotic supplementation on glucose and lipid metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"Abnormalities in glucose and lipid metabolism contribute to the progression and exacerbation of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Fish oil and probiotics are dietary supplements that have the potential to improve glucose and lipid metabolism. However, their efficacy remains unclear in T2DM patients. PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were retrieved to collect randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the efficacy of fish oil or probiotic supplementation in T2DM patients from the database inception to December 13, 2023. Primary outcome indicators encompassed glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and blood lipid profile (triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC). Secondary outcome indicators included inflammatory markers such as tumor necrosis factor -α (TNF-α) and adipocytokine (including leptin and adiponectin). The R software was used for statistical analysis, and GraphPad Prism was used for figure rendering. A total of 60 RCTs involving 3845 T2DM patients were included in the analysis. The results showed that the probiotics (Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Propionibacterium, etc.) were more effective in reducing HOMA-IR than fish oil (Surca = 0.935). Bifidobacterium demonstrated the highest efficacy in reducing HbA1c levels (Surca = 0.963). Regarding lipid metabolism, fish oil was superior to probiotics in lowering TG and TC levels (Surca values of 0.978 and 0.902, respectively). Furthermore, fish oil outperformed probiotics in reducing TNF-α (Surca = 0.839) and leptin (Surca = 0.712), and increasing adiponectin levels (Surca = 0.742). Node-splitting analysis showed good consistency (P > 0.05 for direct, indirect, and network comparison across various interventions). In T2DM patients, fish oil was more effective than probiotics in regulating lipid metabolism. Probiotics outperformed fish oil in regulating glucose metabolism particularly; specifically, Bifidobacterium showed higher efficacy in reducing blood glucose.",Zhang M; Yang F; Feng Q; Ou Y; Zhang J; Wan H; Cao H; Ning P,Diabetology & metabolic syndrome,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38254166/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38251049,The Effects of Spirulina Supplementation on Cardiometabolic Risk Factors: A Narrative Review.,"Spirulina (<i>Arthrospira platensis)</i> is a cyanobacterium associated with multiple health benefits. Cardiometabolic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and diabetes are prevalent yet usually preventable non-communicable diseases. Modifiable risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases include excessive body weight, body inflammation, atherogenic lipid profile, and imbalanced glucose metabolism. This review explores the effects of spirulina on cardiometabolic diseases risk factors. Spirulina was effective in reducing body weight, body mass index, and waist circumference, with a potential dose-dependent effect. It also decreased interleukin 6, an important biomarker of body inflammation, by inhibiting NADPH oxidase enzyme, and lowering insulin resistance. spirulina supplementation also reduced triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Additionally, spirulina reduced fasting blood sugar and post-prandial blood sugar and increased insulin sensitivity, but no effect was observed on glycated hemoglobin A1c. The diverse nutrients, such as phycocyanin, gamma-linolenic acid, and vitamin B12, present in spirulina contribute to its cardiometabolic benefits. The doses used are heterogeneous for most studies, ranging from 1 to 8 grams daily, but most studies administered spirulina for 3 months to observe an effect. The collective evidence suggests that spirulina supplements may help improve risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases, thus, preventing its development. However, due to the heterogeneity of the results, more randomized clinical trials are needed to draw robust conclusions about spirulina's therapeutic potential in ameliorating risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases and fully elucidate the mechanisms by which it exerts its effects.",Sokary S; Bawadi H; Zakaria ZZ; Al-Asmakh M,Journal of dietary supplements,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38251049/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38243784,Selenium Supplementation in Patients with Hashimoto Thyroiditis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials.,"<b><i>Background:</i></b> Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Selenium is an essential trace element required for thyroid hormone synthesis and exerts antioxidant effects. Therefore, it may be of relevance in the management of HT. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effect of selenium supplementation on thyroid function (thyrotropin [TSH], free and total thyroxine [fT4, T4], free and total triiodothyronine [fT3, T3]), thyroid antibodies (thyroid peroxidase antibodies [TPOAb], thyroglobulin antibodies [TGAb], thyrotropin receptor antibody [TRAb]), ultrasound findings (echogenicity, thyroid volume), immune markers, patient-reported outcomes, and adverse events in HT. The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022308377). We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINHAL, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Trials from inception to January 2023 and searched citations of eligible studies. Two independent authors reviewed and coded the identified literature. The primary outcome was TSH in patients without thyroid hormone replacement therapy (THRT); the others were considered secondary outcomes. We synthesized the results as standardized mean differences (SMD) or odds ratio (OR), assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool, and rated the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. <b><i>Results:</i></b> We screened 687 records and included 35 unique studies. Our meta-analysis found that selenium supplementation decreased TSH in patients without THRT (SMD -0.21 [confidence interval, CI -0.43 to -0.02]; 7 cohorts, 869 participants; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 0%). In addition, TPOAb (SMD -0.96 [CI -1.36 to -0.56]; 29 cohorts; 2358 participants; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 90%) and malondialdehyde (MDA; SMD -1.16 [CI -2.29 to -0.02]; 3 cohorts; 248 participants; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 85%) decreased in patients with and without THRT. Adverse effects were comparable between the intervention and control groups (OR 0.89 [CI 0.46 to 1.75]; 16 cohorts; 1339 participants; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 0%). No significant changes were observed in fT4, T4, fT3, T3, TGAb, thyroid volume, interleukin (IL)-2, and IL-10. Overall, certainty of evidence was moderate. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> In people with HT without THRT, selenium was effective and safe in lowering TSH, TPOAb, and MDA levels. Indications for lowering TPOAb were found independent of THRT.",Huwiler VV; Maissen-Abgottspon S; Stanga Z; Mühlebach S; Trepp R; Bally L; Bano A,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38243784/,0,1,0,1,0,0

AD is the most common cause of neurodegenerative disorder in the elderly. Also, neuroinﬂammation is the most common cause of AD pathogenesis. This study investigated the possible relationship between Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) and Alzheimer's Disease. This review is based on research studies indexed in Scopus, Science Direct, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases.  The oral microbiota comprised various microorganisms, such as fungi, archaea, and bacteria. Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) is one of the microorganisms, it stimulates host immune cells and releases cytokines, lysosomal enzymes, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species that lead to cell damage, apoptosis, and inflammation. Therefore, periodontal disease (PerioD) through systemic inflammation leads to some problems like the progression of MCI, production and aggregation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) and tau protein in the brain of the elderly population. In addition, some treatment methods could modulate the adverse effects of P. gingivalis like probiotic dietary supplements, maintaining personal hygiene, as well as gingipain inhibitors which modulate cytokines through blocked Aβ production, ApoE proteolysis, and reduced neuroinflammation. In addition, therapeutic compounds like COR388 and COR286, as gingipain inhibitors, prevent P. gingivalis colonization in the brain and have a beneficial action in some conditions like aspiration pneumonia, low birth rate, rheumatoid arthritis, PerioD and AD.",Owoyele PV; Malekzadeh S,Nigerian journal of physiological sciences : official publication of the Physiological Society of Nigeria,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38243562/,1,0,0,0,0,0

38174000,Protein supplementation: the double-edged sword.,"Protein supplements are widely consumed by athletes as well as young adults and teenagers going to the gym and are an excellent source to increase protein intake, build muscle mass, and enhance recovery. They are available in the form of powders, gummies, protein bars, and ready-to-drink shakes and have been shown to have effects on almost every system in the body. Subjects consuming whey protein-based supplements regularly show significantly lower systolic blood pressure, while subjects who consume soy-based protein supplements have been reported to show a significant decrease in their systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Favorable effects of soy protein consumption have been observed on the serum lipid profile, with significant decreases in serum low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels. Lower postprandial glucose levels have been observed in diabetic subjects as well, which can be attributed to the lower glycemic index of these supplements. This can lead to an indirect decrease in diabetes-related complications. While these supplements affect the body positively, caution has to be exercised while consuming them in excess, as they have been shown to cause hyperfiltration and increased urinary calcium excretion which can, in turn, lead to chronic kidney disease development.

Understanding how these compounds manage diabetic cognitive dysfunction (DCD) is crucial. This comprehensive review explores the etiology of DCD and the effects of alkaloids in foods and dietary supplements that have been investigated as DCD therapies. Data on how dietary alkaloids like berberine, trigonelline, caffeine, capsaicin, 1-deoxynojirimycin, nuciferine, neferine, aegeline, tetramethylpyrazine, piperine, and others regulate cognition in diabetic disorders were collected from PubMed, Research Gate, Web of Science, Science Direct, and other relevant databases. Dietary alkaloids could improve memory in behavioral models and modulate the mechanisms underlying the cognitive benefits of these compounds, including their effects on glucose metabolism, gut microbiota, vasculopathy, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. Evidence suggests that dietary alkaloids hold promise for improving cognition in diabetic patients and could open exciting avenues for future research in diabetes management.",Alkanad M; Hani U; V AH; Ghazwani M; Haider N; Osmani RAM; M D P; Bhat R,"BioFactors (Oxford, England)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38169069/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We conducted a systematic review to assess and synthesize evidence and recommendations on weight management during pregnancy and the postpartum period in women with GDM to provide evidence-based clinical guidance. Nine databases and eighteen websites were searched for clinical decisions, guidelines, recommended practices, evidence summaries, expert consensus, and systematic reviews. A total of 12,196 records were retrieved and fifty-five articles were included in the analysis. Sixty-nine pieces of evidence were summarized, sixty-two of which focused on pregnancy, including benefits, target population, weight management goals, principles, weight monitoring, nutrition assessment and counseling, energy intake, carbohydrate intake, protein intake, fat intake, fiber intake, vitamin and mineral intake, water intake, dietary supplements, sugar-sweetened beverages, sweeteners, alcohol, coffee, food safety, meal arrangements, dietary patterns, exercise assessment and counseling, exercise preparation, type of exercise, intensity of exercise, frequency of exercise, duration of exercise, exercise risk prevention, and pregnancy precautions, and seven focused on the postpartum period, including target population, benefits, postpartum weight management goals, postpartum weight monitoring, dietary recommendations, exercise recommendations, and postpartum precautions. Healthcare providers can develop comprehensive pregnancy and postpartum weight management programs for women with GDM based on the sixty-nine pieces of evidence. However, because of the paucity of evidence on postpartum weight management in women with GDM, future guidance documents should focus more on postpartum weight management in women with GDM.",Huang J; Wu Y; Li H; Cui H; Zhang Q; Long T; Zhang Y; Li M,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38140280/,0,1,0,0,0,0
38128389,The efficacy of magnesium supplementation for gestational diabetes: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"The efficacy of magnesium supplementation is unclear for the treatment of gestational diabetes. This meta-analysis aimed to study the efficacy of magnesium supplementation for glycemic control and pregnant outcomes in women with gestational diabetes. Several databases including PubMed, EMbase, Web of science, EBSCO, and Cochrane library databases have been systematically searched up to July 2023, and we included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy of magnesium supplementation for gestational diabetes. The meta-analysis was performed using the random-effect model or fixed-effect model based on the heterogeneity. Five RCTs and 266 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, compared with control intervention for gestational diabetes, magnesium supplementation was able to significantly decrease FPG (MD = -7.33 mg/dL; 95 % CI = -7.64 to -7.02 mg/dL; P < 0.00001) and HOMA-IR (MD = -0.99; 95 % CI = -1.76 to -0.22; P = 0.01), but resulted in no obvious impact on serum insulin (MD = -4.17 μIU/mL; 95 % CI = -8.49 to 0.14 μIU/mL; P = 0.06), preterm delivery (OR = 0.42; 95 % CI = 0.06 to 2.95; P = 0.38), macrosomia (OR = 0.34; 95 % CI = 0.08 to 1.35; P = 0.13) or BMI change (MD = -0.01 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; 95 % CI = -0.06 to 0.04 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; P = 0.63).

38089432,Biological Role and Related Natural Products of SIRT1 in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease(NAFLD) is an umbrella term for a range of diseases ranging from hepatic fat accumulation and steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in the absence of excessive alcohol consumption and other definite liver damage factors. The incidence of NAFLD has increased significantly in recent years and will continue to grow in the coming decades. NAFLD has become a huge health problem and economic burden. SIRT1 is a member of Sirtuins, a group of highly conserved histone deacetylases regulated by NAD+, and plays a vital role in regulating cholesterol and lipid metabolism, improving oxidative stress, inflammation, and insulin resistance through deacetylating some downstream transcription factors and thus improving NAFLD. Although there are no currently approved drugs for treating NAFLD and some unresolved limitations in developing SIRT1 activators, SIRT1 holds promise as a proper therapeutic target for NAFLD and other metabolic diseases. In recent years, natural products have played an increasingly important role in drug development due to their safety and efficacy. It has been discovered that some natural products may be able to prevent and treat NAFLD by targeting SIRT1 and its related pathways. This paper reviews the mechanism of SIRT1 in the improvement of NALFD and the natural products that regulate NAFLD through SIRT1 and its associated pathways, and discusses the potential of SIRT1 as a therapeutic target for treating NAFLD and the effectiveness of these related natural products as clinical drugs or dietary supplements. These works may provide some new ideas and directions for finding new therapeutic targets for NAFLD and the development of anti-NAFLD drugs with good pharmacodynamic properties.",Meng D; Zhang F; Yu W; Zhang X; Yin G; Liang P; Feng Y; Chen S; Liu H,"Diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity : targets and therapy",2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38089432/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Nevertheless, systematic preclinical studies are still lacking. In this meta-analysis and systematic review, we evaluated the role and potential mechanisms of action of garlic and its derived components in animal models of DKD. We searched eight databases for relevant studies from the establishment of the databases to December 2022 and updated in April 2023 before the completion of this review. A total of 24 trials were included in the meta-analysis. It provided preliminary evidence that supplementing with garlic could improve the indicators of renal function (BUN, Scr, 24 h urine volume, proteinuria, and KI) and metabolic disorders (BG, insulin, and body weight). Meanwhile, the beneficial effects of garlic and its components in DKD could be related to alleviating oxidative stress, suppressing inflammatory reactions, delaying renal fibrosis, and improving glucose metabolism. Furthermore, time-dose interval analysis exhibited relatively greater effectiveness when garlic products were supplied at doses of 500 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> with interventions lasting 8-10 weeks, and garlic components were administered at doses of 45-150 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> with interventions lasting 4-10 weeks. This meta-analysis and systematic review highlights for the first time the therapeutic potential of garlic supplementation in animal models of DKD and offers a more thorough evaluation of its effects and mechanisms to establish an evidence-based basis for designing future clinical trials.",Jiang Y; Li Z; Yue R; Liu G; Yang M; Long C; Yan D,Food & function,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38051214/,0,1,0,1,0,0

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of myo-inositol in decreasing the incidence of gestational diabetes in overweight and obese pregnant women. This meta-analysis was conducted using the standard Cochrane methodology and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled overweight and obese pregnant women and used myo-inositol supplementation. The primary outcome was the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus at 24-28 weeks. Secondary outcomes included cesarean section rate, the incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension, macrosomia and preterm delivery. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used for dichotomous data. Six RCTs were included. Compared to standard micronutrient supplementation, standard dose of myo-inositol (4 g) may reduce the incidence of GDM (RR 0.54; CI [0.30, 0.96]; n = 887 women), but the certainty of evidence is low to very low. With low-dose myo-inositol however, evidence is uncertain about its benefit on the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus in overweight and obese women with RR 0.71; CI [0.14, 3.50]. No adverse effects were noted. For the secondary outcomes, standard dose myo-inositol appears to reduce the incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension and preterm delivery, but the certainty of evidence is low to very low. Current evidence is uncertain on the potential benefit of myo-inositol supplementation in overweight and obese pregnant women. While studies show that 4 g myo-inositol per day may decrease the incidence of GDM, pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-term birth with no associated risk of serious adverse events, the certainty of evidence is low to very low. Future high-quality trials may provide more compelling evidence to support practice recommendations.",Factor PA; Corpuz H,Journal of the ASEAN Federation of Endocrine Societies,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38045667/,0,1,0,1,0,0

Therefore, our present meta-analysis aimed to systematically evaluate the impacts of supplementation of KO on cardiovascular disease risk factors (CVDRFs). Intervention trials assessing KO supplementation on cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes were systematically retrieved for pooling. The primary outcome was lipid profile. Secondary outcomes were consisted by blood pressure, glycemic indices, body composition together with inflammatory markers. We synthesized the effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals and weighted mean difference. To explore the heterogeneity source, we employed meta-regression and subgroup analysis. Quality assessment, publication bias, sensitivity-analysis and the certainty of evidence were also carried out. We included 14 trials (18 treatment arms) with 1458 participants. KO supplementation had beneficial effects on total cholesterol (P = 0.01), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.006), and triglycerides (P = 0.0005). However, no effects were found for other CVDRFs, such as blood pressure, glycemic control, body composition as well as inflammatory markers. Subgroup analyses indicated that these notably favorable effects were observed in trials with a parallel design, treatment duration <8 weeks and subjects with baseline body mass index <28 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The above findings remained consistent in the sensitivity analysis, without obvious publication bias detected. The current evidence demonstrated that daily KO supplementation may as a candidate for lipid management strategies. In future, studies should pay attention to the relationships of KO intake with the incidence of CVD events or all-cause mortality.",Huang H; Liao D; He B; Zhou G; Cui Y,Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38039646/,0,1,0,1,0,0

38003557,Research Progress on the Relationship between Vitamins and Diabetes: Systematic Review.,"Diabetes is a serious chronic metabolic disease that causes complications over time, bringing serious public health challenges that affect different countries across the world. The current clinical drugs for diabetes may lead to adverse effects such as hypoglycemia and liver and abdominal distension and pain, which prompt people to explore new treatments for diabetes without side effects. The research objective of this review article is to systematically review studies on vitamins and diabetes and to explain their possible mechanism of action, as well as to assess the role of vitamins as drugs for the prevention and treatment of diabetes. To achieve our objective, we searched scientific databases in PubMed Central, Medline databases and Web of Science for articles, using ""vitamin"" and ""diabetes"" as key words. The results of numerous scientific investigations revealed that vitamin levels were decreased in humans and animals with diabetes, and vitamins show promise for the prevention and/or control of diabetes through anti-inflammation, antioxidation and the regulation of lipid metabolism. However, a few studies showed that vitamins had no positive effect on the development of diabetes. Currently, studies on vitamins in the treatment of diabetes are still very limited, and there are no clinical data to clarify the dose-effect relationship between vitamins and diabetes; therefore, vitamins are not recommended as routine drugs for the treatment of diabetes. However, we still emphasize the great potential of vitamins in the prevention and treatment of diabetes, and higher quality studies are needed in the future to reveal the role of vitamins in the development of diabetes.",Liu J; Qin L; Zheng J; Tong L; Lu W; Lu C; Sun J; Fan B; Wang F,International journal of molecular sciences,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38003557/,0,1,0,0,0,0
37999402,Algae Food Products as a Healthcare Solution.,"Diseases such as obesity; cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, myocardial infarction and stroke; digestive diseases such as celiac disease; certain types of cancer and osteoporosis are related to food. On the other hand, as the world's population increases, the ability of the current food production system to produce food consistently is at risk. As a result, intensive agriculture has contributed to climate change and a major environmental impact. Research is, therefore, needed to find new sustainable food sources. One of the most promising sources of sustainable food raw materials is macroalgae. Algae are crucial to solving this nutritional deficiency because they are abundant in bioactive substances that have been shown to combat diseases such as hyperglycemia, diabetes, obesity, metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases and cardiovascular diseases. Examples of these substances include polysaccharides such as alginate, fucoidan, agar and carrageenan; proteins such as phycobiliproteins; carotenoids such as β-carotene and fucoxanthin; phenolic compounds; vitamins and minerals. Seaweed is already considered a nutraceutical food since it has higher protein values than legumes and soy and is, therefore, becoming increasingly common. On the other hand, compounds such as polysaccharides extracted from seaweed are already used in the food industry as thickening agents and stabilizers to improve the quality of the final product and to extend its shelf life; they have also demonstrated antidiabetic effects. Among the other bioactive compounds present in macroalgae, phenolic compounds, pigments, carotenoids and fatty acids stand out due to their different bioactive properties, such as antidiabetics, antimicrobials and antioxidants, which are important in the treatment or control of diseases such as diabetes, cholesterol, hyperglycemia and cardiovascular diseases. That said, there have already been some studies in which macroalgae (red, green and brown) have been incorporated into certain foods, but studies on gluten-free products are still scarce, as only the potential use of macroalgae for this type of product is considered. Considering the aforementioned issues, this review aims to analyze how macroalgae can be incorporated into foods or used as a food supplement, as well as to describe the bioactive compounds they contain, which have beneficial properties for human health. In this way, the potential of macroalgae-based products in eminent diseases, such as celiac disease, or in more common diseases, such as diabetes and cholesterol complications, can be seen.",Tavares JO; Cotas J; Valado A; Pereira L,Marine drugs,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37999402/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37994761,Effects of Carob Extract on the Intestinal Microbiome and Glucose Metabolism: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The legume tree known as carob (Ceratonia siliqua L.) is indigenous to the Mediterranean area and over the centuries its pods had been traditionally used mostly as animal feed. However, it has gained great attention in human nutrition due to the molecular compounds it contains, which could offer many potential health benefits: for example, carob is renowned for its high content of fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Moreover, in traditional medicine it is credited with the ability to control glucose metabolism and gut microbiome. Modern science has also extensively acknowledged the numerous health advantages deriving from its consumption, including its anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Due to its abundant contents of pectin, gums, and polyphenols (such as pinitol), carob has garnered significant attention as a well-researched plant with remarkable therapeutic properties. Notably, carob is extensively used in the production of semi-finished pastry products, particularly in ice cream and other creams (especially as a substitute for cocoa/chocolate): these applications indeed facilitate the exploration of its positive effects on glucose metabolism. Our study aimed at examining the effects of carob extract on intestinal microbiota and glucose metabolism. In this review, we conducted a thorough examination, comprising in vitro, in vivo, and clinical trials to appraise the consequences on human health of polyphenols and pectin from different carob species, including recently discovered ones with high polyphenol contents. Our goal was to learn more about the mechanisms through which carob extract can support a balanced gut flora and improve one's glucose metabolism. These results could influence the creation of novel functional foods and dietary supplements, to help with the management and prevention of chronic illnesses like diabetes and obesity.",Micheletti C; Medori MC; Bonetti G; Iaconelli A; Aquilanti B; Matera G; Bertelli M,La Clinica terapeutica,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37994761/,0,1,0,1,0,0
37994760,Unraveling the Role of Prickly Pear Extract as a Potent Nutraceutical Agent Against Metabolic Syndromes.,"Prickly pear (Opuntia) extracts have garnered con-siderable attention in recent years due to their promising medicinal and nutritional properties. This comprehensive review explores the multifaceted potential of prickly pear extracts in mitigating various chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes, obesity, cancer, neuronal diseases, and renal diseases. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the diverse therapeutic applications of Opuntia extracts in managing chronic diseases. The collective evidence underscores the potential of prickly pear as a valuable natural resource for addressing global health challenges. Further research and clinical investigations are warranted to unlock the full potential of Opuntia in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases. Studies have suggested that the bioactive compounds within prickly pear may influence glucose metabolism by improving insulin sensitivity, reducing insulin resistance, and modulating gut microbiota composition. These pathways exhibit potential in the reduction of hyperglycemia, which is a fundamental aspect of metabolic syndromes. Opuntia extracts demonstrate also antioxidant, anti-inflammatory capabilities that can contribute to improving health in various conditions. Further research and clinical investigations are warranted to unlock the full potential of Opuntia in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases.",Dhuli K; Bonetti G; Micheletti C; Macchia A; Iaconelli A; Aquilanti B; Matera G; Ceccarini MR; Beccari T; Bertelli M,La Clinica terapeutica,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37994760/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37956927,Pharmacological modulation of vascular ageing: A review from VascAgeNet.,"Vascular ageing, characterized by structural and functional changes in blood vessels of which arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction are key components, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and other age-related diseases. As the global population continues to age, understanding the underlying mechanisms and developing effective therapeutic interventions to mitigate vascular ageing becomes crucial for improving cardiovascular health outcomes. Therefore, this review provides an overview of the current knowledge on pharmacological modulation of vascular ageing, highlighting key strategies and promising therapeutic targets. Several molecular pathways have been identified as central players in vascular ageing, including oxidative stress and inflammation, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, cellular senescence, macroautophagy, extracellular matrix remodelling, calcification, and gasotransmitter-related signalling. Pharmacological and dietary interventions targeting these pathways have shown potential in ameliorating age-related vascular changes. Nevertheless, the development and application of drugs targeting vascular ageing is complicated by various inherent challenges and limitations, such as certain preclinical methodological considerations, interactions with exercise training and sex/gender-related differences, which should be taken into account. Overall, pharmacological modulation of endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness as hallmarks of vascular ageing, holds great promise for improving cardiovascular health in the ageing population. Nonetheless, further research is needed to fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms and optimize the efficacy and safety of these interventions for clinical translation.",Roth L; Dogan S; Tuna BG; Aranyi T; Benitez S; Borrell-Pages M; Bozaykut P; De Meyer GRY; Duca L; Durmus N; Fonseca D; Fraenkel E; Gillery P; Giudici A; Jaisson S; Johansson M; Julve J; Lucas-Herald AK; Martinet W; Maurice P; McDonnell BJ; Ozbek EN; Pucci G; Pugh CJA; Rochfort KD; Roks AJM; Rotllan N; Shadiow J; Sohrabi Y; Spronck B; Szeri F; Terentes-Printzios D; Tunc Aydin E; Tura-Ceide O; Ucar E; Yetik-Anacak G,Ageing research reviews,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37956927/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37977406,Maternal methyl donor supplementation: A potential therapy for metabolic disorder in offspring.,"The prevalences of diabetes mellitus and obesity are increasing yearly and has become a serious social burden. In addition to genetic factors, environmental factors in early life development are critical in influencing the prevalence of metabolic disorders in offspring. A growing body of evidence suggests the critical role of early methyl donor intervention in offspring health. Emerging studies have shown that methyl donors can influence offspring metabolism through epigenetic modifications and changing metabolism-related genes. In this review, we focus on the role of folic acid, betaine, vitamin B12, methionine, and choline in protecting against metabolic disorders in offspring. To address the current evidence on the potential role of maternal methyl donors, we summarize clinical studies as well as experimental animal models that support the impact of maternal methyl donors on offspring metabolism and discuss the mechanisms of action that may bring about these positive effects. Given the worldwide prevalence of metabolic disorders, these findings could be utilized in clinical practice, in which methyl donor supplementation in the early life years may reverse metabolic disorders in offspring and block the harmful intergenerational effect.",Ren Y; Zeng Y; Wu Y; Zhang Q; Xiao X,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37977406/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37966688,Do Postpartum Maternal Iodine Status or Supplementation Affect Thyroid Function After Delivery? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was, for the first time, to explore whether postpartum maternal iodine status or supplementation is associated with thyroid function after delivery. The MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus were searched up to December 2021 to identify relevant studies. The pooled mean thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4), and thyroxine (T4) concentrations and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated based on maternal urinary iodine concentration (UIC) (< 50, 50-100, 100-200, and > 200 µg/L) or breast milk iodine concentration (BMIC) (< 100 µg/L vs. ≥ 100 µg/L) during postpartum. A fixed/random effects model was used based on the absence/presence of heterogeneity, respectively. The study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42022336145. A total of 2175 studies were identified, of which 18 were eligible for the meta-analysis. The pooled values for TSH, fT4, and T4 concentrations in all subgroups were within the normal range; however, except for TSH, comparing the 95% CI showed no statistically significant difference among different subgroups. The pooled mean for TSH concentration in women with UIC > 200 µg/L was 2.23 mIU/L, whereas the corresponding values in women with UIC < 50, 50-100 and 100-200 µg/L were 0.56, 0.56 and 0.95 mIU/L, respectively. Thyroid hormones in women with BMIC < 100 µg/L and ≥ 100 µg/L were within the normal range. Iodine supplementation during postpartum was not associated with any differences in thyroid parameters, compared to non-supplemented women. In conclusion, iodine status or supplementation had no effect on thyroid hormones in postpartum women.",Nazeri P; Pearce EN; Farrokhzad N; Baghalha F; Shariat M; Azizi F,Biological trace element research,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37966688/,0,1,0,1,0,0
37960227,Modulatory Properties of Vitamin D in Type 2 Diabetic Patients: A Focus on Inflammation and Dyslipidemia.,"Evidence from preclinical studies has found a correlation between the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and vitamin D deficiency. However, evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) revealed inconclusive results on vitamin D supplementation. We explored the effect of vitamin D on inflammation and dyslipidemia in T2D. We comprehensively searched for RCTs evaluating the effect of vitamin D in T2D on PubMed. Data were analyzed using Review Manager 5.3 and reports, such as standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) at a 5% significant level using a random effect model. This study revealed a significant reduction in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) SMD = (-0.51, 95%CI (-0.93, -0.09); <i>p</i> = 0.02), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) SMD = (-1.06, 95%CI (-1.67, -0.45); <i>p</i> < 0.05) in vitamin D compared to placebo. Additionally, interleukin-6 (IL-6) exhibited a marginal effect SMD = (-0.52, 95%CI (-1.05, 0.01), <i>p</i> = 0.05). Furthermore, a significant reduction in the level of triglycerides SMD = (-0.65, 95%CI (-1.11, -0.18), <i>p</i> < 0.05) was observed, concomitant to a significantly increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level SMD = (0.53, 95%CI (0.08, 0.98), <i>p</i> = 0.02). However, no statistically significant changes were observed in total cholesterols SMD = (-0.16, 95%CI (-0.57, 0.24), <i>p</i> = 0.43) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) SMD = (-0.06, 95%CI (-0.37, 0.24), <i>p</i> = 0.67). These findings suggest that vitamin D supplementation may be beneficial in ameliorating inflammation and dyslipidemia in T2D patients.",MacGirlley R; Phoswa WN; Mokgalaboni K,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37960227/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37952433,Effects of chromium supplementation on body composition in patients with type 2 diabetes: A dose-response systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the beneficial effects of chromium supplementation in managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The current systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the associations between chromium supplementation and body composition in patients with T2DM. To achieve this, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that reported the effects of chromium supplementation on body composition such as body weight (BW), body mass index (BMI), fat mass (FM), and waist circumference (WC) in patients with T2DM from inception until July 2023. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a fixed-effects model. The meta-analysis included a total of 14 RCTs. The results showed that chromium supplementation did not have any significant effect on FM (WMD = -0.43%; 95% CI -0.94, 0.09), BMI (WMD: 0.09 kg/M2, 95% CI: -0.03, 0.20), WC (WMD: -0.47 cm, 95% CI: -1.10, 0.16), and BW (WMD: -0.26 kg, 95% CI: -0.69, 0.16). However, subgroup analysis revealed that chromium intake decreased FM in subjects aged ≥ 55 years and when chromium picolinate was used as an intervention. Additionally, there was a non-linear association between the dose of chromium supplementation and BW. The meta-analysis suggests that chromium supplementation does not significantly reduce BW, BMI, WC, and FM in patients with T2DM. Further RCTs with large-scale are required to determine the possible anti-obesity effects of chromium in patients with T2DM.",Vajdi M; Khajeh M; Safaei E; Moeinolsadat S; Mousavi S; Seyedhosseini-Ghaheh H; Abbasalizad-Farhangi M; Askari G,Journal of trace elements in medicine and biology : organ of the Society for Minerals and Trace Elements (GMS),2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37952433/,0,1,0,1,0,0
37950521,The effect of subcutaneous dulaglutide on weight loss in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Dulaglutide, a subcutaneously administered glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, has been hypothesized to lead to weight loss in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the consequences of its prescription on body weight (BW) and other anthropometric indices, for example, body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference (WC), have not been completely clarified. Therefore, we aimed to assess the effects of subcutaneous dulaglutide administration on BW, BMI and WC values in T2DM subjects by means of a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs. We computed a literature search in five databases (PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, EMBASE, Scopus and Google Scholar) from their inception to February 2023 to identify RCTs that examined the influence of subcutaneous dulaglutide on obesity indices. We calculated effect sizes using the random-effects model (using DerSimonian-Laird method). Results were derived across weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Subgroup analyses were applied to explore possible sources of heterogeneity among the RCTs. The current systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in compliance with The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. In total, 18 studies with 33 RCT arms (BW = 33 RCT arms, 14,612 participants, 7869 cases and 6743 controls; BMI = 10 RCT arms, 14,612 subjects, 7869 cases and 6743 controls; WC = 10 RCT arms, 1632 participants, 945 cases and 687 cases) were included in the meta-analysis. BW (WMD: -0.86 kg, 95% CI: -1.22, -0.49, p < 0.001), BMI (WMD: -0.68 kg/m<sup>2</sup> , 95% CI: -0.88, -0.49, p < 0.001) and WC (WMD: -1.23 cm, 95% CI: -1.82, -0.63, p < 0.001) values decreased notably following subcutaneous dulaglutide administration versus placebo. BW notably decreased in RCTs lasting >18 weeks (WMD: -1.42 kg, 95% CI: -1.90, -0.94, p < 0.001), whereas notable reductions in WC were seen in RCTs lasting ≤18 weeks (WMD: -1.78 cm, 95% CI: -2.59, -0.98, p < 0.001). Dulaglutide dosages >1 mg/day significantly decreased BW (WMD: -1.94 kg, 95% CI: -2.54, -1.34, p < 0.001), BMI (WMD: -0.80 kg/m<sup>2</sup> , 95% CI: -1.07, -0.54, p < 0.001) and WC (WMD: -1.47 cm, 95% CI: -1.80, -1.13, p < 0.001). BW decreased particularly following dulaglutide prescription in individuals with obesity (WMD: -1.05 kg, 95% CI: -1.28, -0.82, p < 0.001) versus overweight. The dose-response meta-analysis revealed that BW decreased significantly when dulaglutide was prescribed in doses ≤3 mg/day versus >3 mg/day. Subcutaneous dulaglutide administration in T2DM reduces BW, BMI and WC. The decrease in BW and WC was influenced by the dose and the duration of dulaglutide administration. The reduction in BMI was only influenced by the dosage of dulaglutide. Moreover, T2DM patients who suffered from obesity experienced a notable decrease in BW versus T2DM subjects without obesity.",Li Y; Gong X; Găman MA; Hernández-Wolters B; Velu P; Li Y,European journal of clinical investigation,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37950521/,0,1,0,1,0,0
37939436,A systematic review exploring the mechanisms by which citrus bioflavonoid supplementation benefits blood glucose levels and metabolic complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Citrus bioflavonoids are polyphenolic compounds that are derived from citrus fruits and vegetables. Although they are well known for their powerful antioxidant properties, their effects on glycemic control are not well understood. This review aims to highlight the potential benefits of using citrus bioflavonoids in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and its metabolic complications, as well as the medicinal effects of known subclasses of naturally occurring citrus bioflavonoids. In this systematic review, a survey of studies was conducted from January 2012 to February 2023 using various databases (PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, and Scopus) to determine the effects of citrus bioflavonoid supplementation on reducing oxidative stress, improving lipid profiles, and glycemic index in patients with diabetes mellitus, as well as the proposed mechanisms of action. The results of the survey indicate that citrus bioflavonoids may have a positive impact on reducing oxidative stress levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition to reducing oxidative stress, citrus bioflavonoids may also have a positive impact on other markers of diabetes. For example, studies have shown that they can reduce non-enzymatic protein glycation, which is a process that occurs when glucose molecules bind to proteins in the body. The reduction in oxidative stress that can be achieved using citrus bioflavonoids may help to maintain antioxidant levels in the body, thereby reducing the severity of diabetes and its complications. These findings suggest that citrus bioflavonoids may be a useful complementary therapy for patients with diabetes.",Gupta A; Jamal A; Jamil DA; Al-Aubaidy HA,Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37939436/,0,1,0,0,0,0
37933216,Overview of Natural Supplements for the Management of Diabetes and Obesity.,"Bioactive compounds found in various natural sources, such as fruits, vegetables, and herbs, have been studied for their potential benefits in managing obesity and diabetes.

Consequently, this meta-analysis focused on the association between vitamin D interventions and smoking cessation on glycemic control in T2DM patients. This study adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Cochrane Library, EMBASE and PubMed databases were used for a language-inclusive literature search until November 2022. The primary outcomes of this meta-analysis were changes in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level, vitamin D concentration and body mass index (BMI) values. This meta-analysis included 14 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 23,289 individuals with T2DM. Nine RCTs were related to vitamin D supplementation interventions, and 5 RCTs were related to smoking cessation interventions. The studies on vitamin D supplementation showed a substantial change in the intervention group, with a risk ratio (RR) of 0.72 (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.58, 0.88; p = 0.001) and an odds ratio (OR) of 0.52 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.78; p = 0.002); high heterogeneity was observed (I2 ≥ 95%). Similarly, the smoking cessation studies showed a substantial change in the intervention group, with a RR of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.99; p = 0.04) and an OR of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.99; p = 0.04); high heterogeneity was observed (I2 = 87%).

37880477,Selenium Species in Diabetes Mellitus Type 2.,"Selenium is an important trace element for humans and animals as it plays a key role in several major metabolic pathways. Several studies were conducted to better understand the role of selenium against diabetes mellitus (DM), particularly type 2 (T2DM), but the obtained conclusions are contradictory. A simple linear relationship does not exist between the risk of T2DM and selenium levels but is best represented in a dose-dependent manner, getting often the U-graph. This relation also depends on selenium chemical forms that are present in a diet or supplements. Both too low and too high selenium intakes could increase the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the baseline status of Se should be taken into consideration to avoid over-supplementation.

37870684,Zinc Supplementation in Individuals with Prediabetes and type 2 Diabetes: a GRADE-Assessed Systematic Review and Dose-Response Meta-analysis.,"Zinc supplementation has therapeutic effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, including dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and inflammation as the main contributors to CVD pathogenesis. Since CVD is a major cause of mortality among people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), this study aimed to overview the potential effects of zinc supplementation on CVD risk factors in T2DM patients. To determine appropriate randomized clinical trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of zinc supplementation on CVD risk factors, electronic sources including PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were systematically searched until January 2023. The heterogeneity of trials was checked using the I<sup>2</sup> statistic. According to the heterogeneity tests, random-effects models were estimated, and pooled data were defined as the weighted mean difference (WMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Of the 4004 initial records, 23 studies that met inclusion criteria were analyzed in this meta-analysis. The pooled findings indicated the significant lowering effects of zinc supplementation on triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), fasting blood glucose (FBG), hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), and C-reactive protein (CRP), while high-density cholesterol (HDL) concentrations showed an elevation after zinc supplementation. In addition to statistical significance, the effect of zinc supplementation on most of the variables was clinically significant; however, the quality of evidence in the included studies is regarded as low or very low for most variables. Our study demonstrated that zinc supplementation has beneficial effects on glycemic control markers, lipid profile, and CRP levels as a classic marker of inflammation in T2DM. Due to the high degree of heterogeneity between studies and the low rate of quality in them, further well-designed studies are necessitated to strengthen our findings.",Nazari M; Nikbaf-Shandiz M; Pashayee-Khamene F; Bagheri R; Goudarzi K; Hosseinnia NV; Dolatshahi S; Omran HS; Amirani N; Ashtary-Larky D; Asbaghi O; Ghanavati M,Biological trace element research,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37870684/,0,1,0,1,0,0
37843970,Impact of Maternal Essential Fatty Acid Intake on the Birth Weight of Infants.,"Increased uptake of essential fatty acids during pregnancy through seafood and supplementation has been shown to positively correlate with gestational age and increased infant birth weight. We aimed to evaluate the effect of maternal dietary intake of essential fatty acids, supplementation on gestational period and infant birth weight. A literature search with the help of various databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science and Scopus was conducted. Original research articles and intervention-based studies, which involve an association between dietary intake and supplementation of essential fatty acids during full-term pregnancy on human infant birth outcomes and published from 2011 to 2021, were included. In total, there were 21 intervention-based studies, including full-term pregnant women with or without existing comorbidities, which compared essential fatty acids in the form of dietary sources and supplementation with dietary counseling and with or without placebo. The intervention trials included in this review were conducted in developed and developing countries. Half of the pregnant women who enrolled in the study had comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension, which might increase their risk of adverse maternal and infant birth outcomes. Most of the studies included in the review have reported a positive association between improvised dietary and supplementation intake of essential fatty acids with increased length of gestation, infant birth weight and other parameters such as head circumference, infant birth length and growth velocity. Positive correlations were found between increased consumption of essential fatty acids in food sources and supplements with improvised infant birth weight and gestational period.",Masina M; Medithi S; Muley A,Journal of mother and child,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37843970/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37838255,<sub>Omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids: Metabolism and health implications</sub>.,"Recently, omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFAs) have gained substantial interest due to their specific structure and biological functions. Humans cannot naturally produce these fatty acids (FAs), making it crucial to obtain them from our diet. This comprehensive review details n-3 LC-PUFAs and their role in promoting and maintaining optimal health. The article thoroughly analyses several sources of n-3 LC-PUFAs and their respective bioavailability, covering marine, microbial and plant-based sources. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of the biological impacts of n-3 LC-PUFAs on health conditions, with particular emphasis on cardiovascular disease (CVD), gastrointestinal (GI) cancer, diabetes, depression, arthritis, and cognition. In addition, we highlight the significance of fortification and supplementation of n-3 LC-PUFAs in both functional foods and dietary supplements. Additionally, we conducted a detailed analysis of the several kinds of n-3 LC-PUFAs supplements currently available in the market, including an assessment of their recommended intake, safety, and effectiveness. The dietary guidelines associated with n-3 LC-PUFAs are also highlighted, focusing on the significance of maintaining a well-balanced intake of n-3 PUFAs to enhance health benefits.

37836558,The Southern European Atlantic Diet and Its Supplements: The Chemical Bases of Its Anticancer Properties.,"Scientific evidence increasingly supports the strong link between diet and health, acknowledging that a well-balanced diet plays a crucial role in preventing chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular issues, and certain types of cancer. This perspective opens the door to developing precision diets, particularly tailored for individuals at risk of developing cancer. It encompasses a vast research area and involves the study of an expanding array of compounds with multilevel ""omics"" compositions, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics, miRNomics, and metabolomics. We review here the components of the Southern European Atlantic Diet (SEAD) from both a chemical and pharmacological standpoint. The information sources consulted, complemented by crystallographic data from the Protein Data Bank, establish a direct link between the SEAD and its anticancer properties. The data collected strongly suggest that SEAD offers an exceptionally healthy profile, particularly due to the presence of beneficial biomolecules in its foods. The inclusion of olive oil and paprika in this diet provides numerous health benefits, and scientific evidence supports the anticancer properties of dietary supplements with biomolecules sourced from vegetables of the brassica genus. Nonetheless, further research is warranted in this field to gain deeper insights into the potential benefits of the SEAD's bioactive compounds against cancer.",Vivanco PG; Taboada P; Coelho A,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37836558/,1,0,0,0,0,0

37821362,Omics insights into the responses to dietary selenium.,"Selenium is a well-known health-relevant element related with cancer chemoprevention, neuroprotective roles, beneficial in diabetes, and in several infectious diseases, among others. It is naturally present in some foods, but deficiency in people led to the production of nutraceuticals, supplements, and functional food enriched in this element. There is a U-shaped link between selenium levels and health and a narrow range between toxic and essential levels, and thus, supplementation should be performed carefully. Omics methodologies have become valuable approaches to delve into the responses of dietary selenium in mammals that allowed a deeper knowledge about the metabolism of this element as well as its biological role. In this review, we discuss omics approaches from the workflows to their applications that has been previously used to deep insight into the metabolism of dietary selenium. There is a special focus on selenoproteins, metabolomics responses in blood and tissues (e.g., brain, reproductive organs, etc.) as well as the impact on gut microbiota and its metabolites profile. Thus, we mainly reviewed heteroatom-tagged proteomics, metallomics, metabolomics, and metataxonomics, usually combined with transcriptomics, genomics, and other molecular methods.",Arias-Borrego A; Callejón-Leblic B; Collado MC; Abril N; García-Barrera T,Proteomics,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37821362/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis of RCTs was to assess the effects of cinnamon supplementation in managing glycemic control in patients with T2DM. Scientific international databases including Scopus, Web of Sciences, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched till December 2022. For net changes in glycemic control, standard mean differences (SMDs) were calculated using random-effects models. Findings from 24 RCTs revealed that cinnamon supplementation had a statistically significant reduction in fasting blood sugar (SMD: -1.32; 95% CI: -1.77, -0.87, p < 0.001), Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (SMD: -1.32; 95% CI: -1.77, -0.87, p < 0.001), and hemoglobin A1C (SMD: -0.67; 95% CI: -1.18, -0.15, p = 0.011) compared with the control group in patients with T2DM. Additionally, cinnamon did not change the serum levels of insulin (SMD: -0.17; 95% CI: -0.34, 0.01, p = 0.058) significantly. Our analysis indicated that glycemic control indicators are significantly decreased by cinnamon supplementation. Together, these findings support the notion that cinnamon supplementation might have clinical potential as an adjunct therapy for managing T2DM.",Moridpour AH; Kavyani Z; Khosravi S; Farmani E; Daneshvar M; Musazadeh V; Faghfouri AH,Phytotherapy research : PTR,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37818728/,0,1,0,1,0,0

37811643,Health aspects of vegan diets among children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analyses.,"Health effects of vegan diets among children and adolescents are a controversial public health topic. Thus, the aim of the present systematic review is to evaluate a broad range of health outcomes among vegan children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years. 18 studies met the inclusion criteria (17 cross-sectional, 1 RCT). Meta-analyses showed lower protein, calcium, vitamin B2, saturated fatty acid, and cholesterol intakes, and lower ferritin, HDL and LDL levels as well as height in vegan compared to omnivorous children/adolescents. Higher intakes of carbohydrates, polyunsaturated fatty acids, fiber, folate, vitamins C and E, magnesium, iron, and potassium were observed in vegans. Blood levels of vitamin B12 were higher among vegan children due to supplement use. Single study results suggested further differences between vegan and non-vegan children, such as lower bone mineral content or urinary iodine among vegan children. Risk of Bias was rated as high or very high in 7 out of 18 studies. The certainty of evidence for the meta-analyses was low (<i>n</i> = 2) or very low (<i>n</i> = 46). Overall, the available evidence points to both risks and benefits associated with a vegan diet among children, although more and better designed studies are needed.",Koller A; Rohrmann S; Wakolbinger M; Gojda J; Selinger E; Cahova M; Světnička M; Haider S; Schlesinger S; Kühn T; Keller JW,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37811643/,0,1,0,1,0,0

This systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessed the impact of MP supplementation on the glycemic parameters in adults. A systematic search was carried out among online databases to determine eligible RCTs published up to November 2022. A random-effects model was performed for the meta-analysis. A total of 36 RCTs with 1851 participants were included in the pooled analysis. It was displayed that supplementation with MP effectively reduced levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG) (weighted mean difference (WMD): -1.83 mg/dL, 95% CI: -3.28, -0.38; P = 0.013), fasting insulin (WMD: -1.06 uU/mL, 95% CI: -1.76, -0.36; P = 0.003), and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (WMD: -0.27, 95% CI: -0.40, -0.14; P < 0.001) while making no remarkable changes in serum hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values (WMD: 0.01%, 95% CI: -0.14, 0.16; P = 0.891). However, there was a significant decline in serum levels of HbA1c among participants with normal baseline body mass index (BMI) based on sub-group analyses. In addition, HOMA-IR values were significantly lower in the MP supplement-treated group than their untreated counterparts in short- and long-term supplementation (≤ 8 and > 8 weeks) with high or moderate doses (≥ 60 or 30-60 g/d) of MP or whey protein (WP). Serum FBG levels were considerably reduced upon short-term administration of a low daily dose of WP (< 30 g). Furthermore, the levels of serum fasting insulin were remarkably decreased during long-term supplementation with high or moderate daily doses of WP. The findings of this study suggest that supplementation with MP may improve glycemic control in adults by reducing the values of fasting insulin, FBG, and HOMA-IR. Additional trials with longer durations are required to confirm these findings.",Mohammadi S; Asbaghi O; Dolatshahi S; Omran HS; Amirani N; Koozehkanani FJ; Garmjani HB; Goudarzi K; Ashtary-Larky D,Nutrition journal,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37798798/,0,1,0,1,0,0

37775606,Ferritin and iron supplements in gestational diabetes mellitus: less or more?,"Iron metabolism has been found to be closely related to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Excessive ferritin levels were shown to be related to an increased risk of GDM because of iron overload which may lead to insulin resistance and β-cell injury by enhancing oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. On the contrary, insufficient ferritin levels can cause a number of obstetric complications, such as high incidence rates of anaemia and gestational hypertension. Therefore, high or low ferritin levels may have adverse effects on the mother and the foetus, putting clinicians in a dilemma when giving pregnant women iron supplements. This also explains why there have been more conflicting findings in the studies on dietary or oral iron supplementation during pregnancy. Hence, there is an urgent need for more evidence and strategies for appropriate recommendations for ferritin levels and iron supplementation during pregnancy to prevent iron insufficiency without causing iron overload and increasing the risk of GDM. Therefore, we gave an updated review on the association of GDM with ferritin metabolism, ferritin levels and iron supplementation based on the summary of the latest research.",Li T; Zhang J; Li P,European journal of nutrition,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37775606/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Sufficient VD concentrations are of clinical relevance, particularly in the context of physiological alterations, such as those occurring during pregnancy when maternal VD is the sole source for the developing fetus. As a result, inadequate VD concentrations in pregnancy have been associated with perinatal complications and adverse neonatal outcomes, including preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, increased rates of cesarean section, low birth weight, small-for-gestational-age infants, poor immune and skeletal growth, allergies, and respiratory infections. Over the past few decades, several observational studies have underlined the important role of maternal VD in the neural, musculoskeletal, and psychomotor growth and bone health of the offspring. However, the complexity of the factors involved in regulating and assessing VD homeostasis, including race, sun exposure, dietary habits, and laboratory measurement techniques, makes the interpretation of relevant research findings challenging.

37691189,Managing Diabetic Complications with Alternative Therapeutic Strategies.,"Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease affecting millions worldwide. It is characterized by a lack of insulin production or impaired insulin function, leading to elevated blood glucose levels. Conventional treatment methods for diabetes management typically include lifestyle changes and medications. However, alternative therapies have gained attention in recent years, including traditional medicine containing bioactive compounds, supplements like vitamin D and Omega-3 fatty acids, aromatherapy, and homeopathy. Diabetic complications are common in patients with uncontrolled diabetes and can lead to serious health problems, including diabetic retinopathy, impaired wound healing, kidney disease, nerve damage, and cardiovascular disease. Alternative remedies, such as traditional medicine containing bioactive compounds, supplements, and aromatherapy, have been studied for their potential benefits in managing these complications. Traditional medicines like bitter melon, cinnamon, and fenugreek have been shown to have anti-diabetic effects due to their bioactive compounds. Similarly, supplements like vitamin D and Omega-3 fatty acids have been found to improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Aromatherapy, which involves the use of essential oils, has also been explored for its potential benefits in diabetes management. Homeopathy, which uses highly diluted substances to stimulate the body's natural healing abilities, has been used to treat diabetes-related symptoms like neuropathy and wounds. Personalized care is essential in natural diabetes management because each person's body and health needs are unique. A holistic approach that addresses the individual's physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being is essential. As research in this field continues to expand, a more comprehensive understanding of diabetes management will lead to improved outcomes for those living with this condition.",Srivastava SP; Upadhyay P; Das S; Tiwari N; Mishra S; Tripathi SM,Current diabetes reviews,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37691189/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Currently, guidelines for 25(OH)D assessment and vitamin D supplementation in bariatric patients, pre- and post-surgery, are still lacking. The aim of this work is to analyse systematically the published experience on 25(OH)D status and vitamin D supplementation, pre- and post-surgery, and to propose, on this basis, recommendations for management. Preoperatively, 18 studies including 2,869 patients were evaluated. Prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency as defined by 25(OH)D < 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) was 85%, whereas when defined by 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) was 57%. The median preoperative 25(OH)D level was 19.75 ng/mL. After surgery, 39 studies including 5,296 patients were analysed and among those undergoing either malabsorptive or restrictive procedures, a lower rate of vitamin D insufficiency and higher 25(OH)D levels postoperatively were observed in patients treated with high-dose oral vitamin D supplementation, defined as ≥ 2,000 IU/daily (mostly D3-formulation), compared with low-doses (< 2,000 IU/daily). Our recommendations based on this systematic review and meta-analysis should help clinical practice in the assessment and management of vitamin D status before and after bariatric surgery. Assessment of vitamin D should be performed pre- and postoperatively in all patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Regardless of the type of procedure, high-dose supplementation is recommended in patients after bariatric surgery.",Giustina A; di Filippo L; Facciorusso A; Adler RA; Binkley N; Bollerslev J; Bouillon R; Casanueva FF; Cavestro GM; Chakhtoura M; Conte C; Donini LM; Ebeling PR; Fassio A; Frara S; Gagnon C; Latella G; Marcocci C; Mechanick JI; Minisola S; Rizzoli R; Santini F; Shaker JL; Sempos C; Ulivieri FM; Virtanen JK; Napoli N; Schafer AL; Bilezikian JP,Reviews in endocrine & metabolic disorders,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37665480/,0,1,0,1,0,0

This study aimed to examine whether the effect of vitamin D supplementation on bone mineral density (BMD) in children and adolescents differs by baseline vitamin D status and estimate the effect in vitamin D-deficient individuals. This is a systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, MBASE, CINAHL, AMED, and ISI Web of Science (until May 27, 2020) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of vitamin D supplementation reporting bone density outcomes after ≥6 mo in healthy individuals aged 1-19 y. We used two-stage IPD meta-analysis to determine treatment effects on total body bone mineral content and BMD at the hip, femoral neck, lumbar spine, and proximal and distal forearm after 1 y; examine whether effects varied by baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration, and estimate treatment effects for each 25(OH)D subgroup. Eleven RCTs were included. Nine comprising 1439 participants provided IPD (86% females, mean baseline 25(OH)D = 36.3 nmol/L). Vitamin D supplementation had a small overall effect on total hip areal BMD (weighted mean difference = 6.8; 95% confidence interval: 0.7, 12.9 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>; I<sup>2</sup> = 7.2%), but no effects on other outcomes. There was no clear evidence of linear or nonlinear interactions between baseline 25(OH)D and treatment; effects were similar in baseline 25(OH)D subgroups (cutoff of 35 or 50 nmol/L). The evidence was of high certainty. Clinically important benefits for bone density from 1-y vitamin D supplementation in healthy children and adolescents, regardless of baseline vitamin D status, are unlikely. However, our findings are mostly generalizable to White postpubertal girls and do not apply to those with baseline 25(OH)D outside the studied range or with symptomatic vitamin D deficiency (e.g., rickets).

37656233,The effects of L-carnitine supplementation on inflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers in adults: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis.,"L-carnitine supplementation may be beneficial in improving inflammatory conditions and reducing the level of inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, according to the finding of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effect of L-carnitine supplementation on inflammation in adults. To obtain acceptable articles up to October 2022, a thorough search was conducted in databases including PubMed, ISI Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and Scopus. A random-effects model was used to estimate the weighted mean difference (WMD). We included the 48 RCTs (n = 3255) with 51 effect sizes in this study. L-carnitine supplementation had a significant effect on C-reactive protein (CRP) (p < 0.001), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (p = 0.001), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (p = 0.002), malondialdehyde (MDA) (p = 0.001), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (p = 0.029), alanine transaminase (ALT) (p < 0.001), and aspartate transaminase (AST) (p < 0.001) in intervention, compared to the placebo group. Subgroup analyses showed that L-carnitine supplementation had a lowering effect on CRP and TNF-α in trial duration ≥ 12 weeks in type 2 diabetes and BMI ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. L-carnitine supplementation reduced ALT levels in overweight and normal BMI subjects at any trial dose and trial duration ≥ 12 weeks and reduced AST levels in overweight subjects and trial dose ≥ 2 g/day. This meta-analysis revealed that L-carnitine supplementation effectively reduces the inflammatory state by increasing the level of TAC and decreasing the levels of CRP, IL-6, TNF-α and MDA in the serum.",Rastgoo S; Fateh ST; Nikbaf-Shandiz M; Rasaei N; Aali Y; Zamani M; Shiraseb F; Asbaghi O,Inflammopharmacology,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37656233/,0,1,0,1,0,0
37654199,The effects of Quercetin supplementation on cardiometabolic outcomes: An umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials.,"Quercetin is a bioactive flavonoid, but the effect of it on cardiometabolic factors has remained uncertain and previous findings from meta-analyses have been controversial. To provide an overview of the effects of Quercetin on cardiometabolic factors based on meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). MEDLINE, SciVerse Scopus, and Clarivate Analytics Web of Science databases were searched to identify eligible publications. As part of the umbrella review, we summarized pooled estimates, 95% CIs, heterogeneity, and publication bias. A GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach was used to rate the certainty of evidence. Five meta-analyses including 18 eligible RCTs plus 5 RCTs that were not included in previous meta-analyses were found. The results indicated Quercetin does not affect diastolic blood pressure (DBP), lipid profile, inflammation, anthropometric indices, fasting plasma glucose (FBG), and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). However, Quercetin supplementation could significantly reduce systolic blood pressure (SBP) (weighted mean difference (WMD): -1.9, 95% CI = -3.2 to -0.6, I<sup>2</sup>  = 88.3%) and insulin level (WMD: -1.07, 95% CI = -1.9 to -0.1, I<sup>2</sup>  = 75.0%). The certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Quercetin supplementation has reducing effects on SBP and insulin levels but not other cardiometabolic parameters.

This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to summarize the current data on the effects of zinc supplementation on lipid profiles in patients with T2DM. Three online databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched to find relevant studies published until September 2022. The exposure was zinc supplementation, and the outcomes were low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglyceride (TG), and total cholesterol (TC). Fourteen randomized clinical trials consisting of 1067 patients were included in the statistical analysis. Significant improvement was observed in all 4 lipid profile components. Following zinc supplementation, a significant decrease was observed in TC (weighted mean difference [WMD]: -16.16; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -26.43, -5.89; P = 0.002), LDL (WMD: -6.18; 95% CI: -9.35, -3.02; P < 0.001), and TG (WMD: -13.08; 95% CI: -21.83, -4.34; P = 0.003). After analyzing 13 studies reporting HDL, a significant increase was seen (WMD: 3.76; 95% CI: 1.30, 6.22; P = 0.003). In a nonlinear dose-response analysis, a significant inverse association was observed between <12 wk zinc supplementation and TC, LDL, and TG (TC: WMD: -5, P<sub>nonlinearity</sub> < 0.001; LDL: WMD: -5, P<sub>nonlinearity</sub> = 0.07, TG: WMD: -16.5, P<sub>nonlinearity</sub> = 0.006). Nonlinear dose-response analysis shows that the optimum elemental zinc dosage for the best response to the supplementation for TC, LDL, and TG are 120, 100, and 140 mg/d, respectively (TC: WMD: -5, P<sub>nonlinearity</sub> < 0.001; LDL: WMD: -10, P<sub>nonlinearity</sub> = 0.006, TG: WMD: -50, P<sub>nonlinearity</sub> = 0.031).

37593349,Effects of vitamin D supplementation on ovulation and pregnancy in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"To evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on pregnancy and ovulation in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome. We searched Pubmed, Medline (via Ovid, 1974 to 2020), EMBASE (via Ovid, 1974 to 2020), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (via Ovid), Web of Science, CNKI, WangFang and the Vip database from inception until April 2021. Two researchers independently screened articles, collected data and evaluated the quality, with Review manager 5.3 for meta-analysis. Totally 20 randomized controlled studies with 1961 subjects were included. Meta analysis showed that pregnancy rate [RR=1.44 (1.28, 1.62), p<0.00,001], ovulation rate [RR=1.42 (1.14, 1.78), p=0.002] and matured oocytes rate [RR=1.08 (1.03, 1.13), p=0.002] of vitamin D supplementation group were significantly higher than those of control group. Meanwhile, early miscarriage rate [RR=0.44 (0.30, 0.66), p<0.00,001], androgen level [MD=-2.31 (-3.51, -1.11), p=0.0002], luteinizing hormone [MD=-1.47 (-2.57, -0.36), p=0.009], follicle stimulating hormone [MD=-0.15 (-0.24, -0.05), p=0.002], and premature delivery rate [RR=0.38, 95% CI (0.21, 0.70), p=0.002] were declined significantly than the controls. However, only one article suggested that the progesterone [MD=6.52 (4.52, 8.52), p<0.05] in the vitamin D intervention group was increased. There was no notable difference in the biochemical pregnancy rate [RR=0.95 (0.55, 1.63), p=0.84], gestational hypertension rate [RR=0.40, 95% CI (0.15, 1.11), p=0.08], gestational diabetes mellitus rate [RR=0.27, 95% CI (0.05, 1.39), p=0.11], fertilization rate [RR=1.05 (1.00, 1.10), p=0.04], cleavage rate [RR=1.03 (0.99, 1.06), p=0.17], high-quality embryo rate [RR=1.08 (0.98, 1.20), p=0.10], endometrial thickness [MD=0.10], 77 (-0.23, 1.77), p=0.13], estrogen level [MD=-0.34 (-1.55, 0.87), p=0.59], LH/FSH [MD=-0.14, 95% CI (-0.48, 0.20), p=1.00] and anti-Mullerian hormone [MD=-0.22 (-0.65, 0.21), p=0.32]. Vitamin D supplementation contribute to the higher pregnancy and ovulation rates, and lower androgen, LH, FSH and early miscarriage rates in women with PCOS, regardless of the use of ovulation induction drugs or assisted reproductive technologies. However, no significant improvement was observed in fertilization rate or cleavage rate.

37571285,Does the Micronutrient Molybdenum Have a Role in Gestational Complications and Placental Health?,"Molybdenum is an essential trace element for human health and survival, with molybdenum-containing enzymes catalysing multiple reactions in the metabolism of purines, aldehydes, and sulfur-containing amino acids. Recommended daily intakes vary globally, with molybdenum primarily sourced through the diet, and supplementation is not common. Although the benefits of molybdenum as an anti-diabetic and antioxidant inducer have been reported in the literature, there are conflicting data on the benefits of molybdenum for chronic diseases. Overexposure and deficiency can result in adverse health outcomes and mortality, although physiological doses remain largely unexplored in relation to human health. The lack of knowledge surrounding molybdenum intake and the role it plays in physiology is compounded during pregnancy. As pregnancy progresses, micronutrient demand increases, and diet is an established factor in programming gestational outcomes and maternal health. This review summarises the current literature concerning varied recommendations on molybdenum intake, the role of molybdenum and molybdoenzymes in physiology, and the contribution these play in gestational outcomes.",Foteva V; Fisher JJ; Qiao Y; Smith R,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37571285/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Multiple comorbidities and the risk of polypharmacy in the elderly make it challenging to determine the appropriate drug, dosage, and maintenance of therapy. Age-dependent processes play a contributing role in neuropathy given that diabetic neuropathy (DN) is the most common form of neuropathy. This narrative review is mainly focused on the drug treatment approach for neuropathy-associated pain in aged people including both drugs and dietary supplements, considering the latter as add-on mechanism-based treatments to increase the effectiveness of usual treatments by implementing their activity or activating other analgesic pathways. On one hand, the limited clinical studies assessing the effectiveness and the adverse effects of existing pain management options in this age segment of the population (> 65), on the other hand, the expanding global demographics of the elderly contribute to building up an unresolved pain management problem that needs the attention of healthcare providers, researchers, and health authorities as well as the expansion of the current therapeutic options.",Marchesi N; Fahmideh F; Pascale A; Allegri M; Govoni S,Current neuropharmacology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37550909/,1,0,0,0,0,0

37530952,A New Approach to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and Related Cardio-metabolic Risk Factors: Dietary Polyphenols.,"Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disease characterized by ovulatory dysfunction, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovarian morphology and causing various reproductive, metabolic, cardiovascular, oncological, and psychological complications. Recent meta-analyses and systemic reviews showed that PCOS increases the risk factor for various cardio-metabolic complications like insulin resistance, type II diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and endothelial dysfunction. In addition to these, it was suggested that chronic low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress are the underlying mechanisms of PCOS-mediated metabolic consequences and might trigger cardio-metabolic risk in women with PCOS. At this point, there is substantial evidence to suggest that various non-nutrient food components modulate cardio-metabolic health together with inflammation and oxidative stress. Increasing the intake of dietary polyphenols might reduce oxidative stress and inflammation and thus alleviate the risk of metabolic, endothelial, and cardiovascular disorders. Nowadays, there are an increasing number of studies related to the effects of dietary polyphenols on PCOS and its accompanying cardio-metabolic disturbances. Currently, there is a cumulative number of studies connected to the effects of dietary polyphenols on PCOS and accompanying cardio-metabolic disturbances. However, there is a lack of knowledge in combining the probable mechanisms of dietary polyphenols on PCOS and related cardio-metabolic consequences. Thus, the effects of dietary polyphenols on PCOS and accompanying cardio-metabolic disturbances need to be discussed and evaluated with underlying mechanisms. Consequently, this review was written to reveal the potential effects of dietary polyphenols on PCOS and related metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors in all their aspects.",Ulug E; Pinar AA,Current nutrition reports,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37530952/,1,0,0,0,0,0

In this meta-analysis and systematic review, we strive to define the potential association between serum or supplemental Vitamin D Levels and insulin resistance respectively, as well as the contribution of Vitamin D to type 2 diabetes, and to summarize the biologic plausibility of Vitamin D. Four databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) were searched for this Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to find appropriate observational studies and clinical trials published in English through to July 2022. EndNote (version X9) is used to manage the literature search results. We calculated Standard Mean Differences (SMDs) and Risk Ratios (RRs) with their 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs), separately, for continuous and dichotomous outcomes. The correlation coefficients were normalized to z values through Fisher's z-transformation to calculate the relevant statistics. Meta-analyses were carried out for all comparisons, based on a random-effects pooling model. Data analysis was performed using RevMan (version 5.3) and STATA (version 15.1). All statistical tests were two-sided, with P < 0.05 were regarded as significant. In our current meta-analysis, there are 18 RCTs and 20 observational studies including 1243 and 11,063 participants respectively. In the overall analysis, the diabetic with Vitamin D supplement treatment group showed significantly improve serum insulin (SMD =  - 0.265, 95% CI - 0.394 to - 0.136, P < 0.05), glucose (SMD =  - 0.17, 95% CI - 0.301to - 0.039, P < 0.05) and HOMA-IR (SMD =  - 0.441, 95% CI - 0.582 to - 0.3, P < 0.05) compared with the routine treatment group.

The dose-response evaluation displayed a substantial linear association between the intervention duration and changes in serum HbA1c levels. However, the analysis did not demonstrate any significant effect of vitamin C on serum values of homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance(HOMA-IR) in diabetic patients. Subgroup analyses indicated that high-dose vitamin C administration (≥1000 mg/d) considerably decreased serum HOMA-IR levels. These findings suggest that long-term (≥12 weeks) and high-dose vitamin C supplementation (≥1000 mg/d) may ameliorate glycemic profile in T2DM patients.

Many people hope to solve this problem by using food supplements, as they can be self-prescribed, contain molecules of natural origin considered to be incapable of causing damage to health, and the only sacrifice they require is economic. The market offers supplements containing food plant-derived molecules (e.g., primary and secondary metabolites, vitamins, and fibers), microbes (probiotics), and microbial-derived fractions (postbiotics). They can control lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, reduce appetite (interacting with the central nervous system) and adipogenesis, influence intestinal microbiota activity, and increase energy expenditure. Unfortunately, the copious choice of products and different legislation on food supplements worldwide can confuse consumers. This review summarizes the activity and toxicity of dietary supplements for weight control to clarify their potentiality and adverse reactions.

37483080,Health Effects of Vitamin D Supplementation: Lessons Learned From Randomized Controlled Trials and Mendelian Randomization Studies.,"Vitamin D plays an important role in calcium homeostasis and many cellular processes. Although vitamin D supplements are widely recommended for community-dwelling adults, definitive data on whether these supplements benefit clinically important skeletal and extraskeletal outcomes have been conflicting. Although observational studies on effects of vitamin D on musculoskeletal and extraskeletal outcomes may be confounded by reverse causation, randomized controlled studies (RCTs) and Mendelian randomization (MR) studies can help to elucidate causation. In this review, we summarize the recent findings from large RCTs and/or MR studies of vitamin D on bone health and risk of fractures, falls, cancer, and cardiovascular disease, disorders of the immune system, multiple sclerosis, and mortality in community-dwelling adults. The primary analyses indicate that vitamin D supplementation does not decrease bone loss, fractures, falls, cancer incidence, hypertension, or cardiovascular risk in generally healthy populations. Large RCTs and meta-analyses suggest an effect of supplemental vitamin D on cancer mortality. The existence of extraskeletal benefits of vitamin D supplementations are best documented for the immune system especially in people with poor vitamin D status, autoimmune diseases, and multiple sclerosis. Accumulating evidence indicates that vitamin D may reduce all-cause mortality. These findings, in mostly vitamin D-replete populations, do not apply to older adults in residential communities or adults with vitamin D deficiency or osteoporosis. The focus of vitamin D supplementation should shift from widespread use in generally healthy populations to targeted vitamin D supplementation in select individuals, good nutritional approaches, and elimination of vitamin D deficiency globally. © 2023 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).",Bouillon R; LeBoff MS; Neale RE,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37483080/,1,0,0,0,0,0

An umbrella review (UR) and updated systematic reviews and meta-analyses (SRMAs) were conducted to evaluate the effects of CL compared with a placebo/standard treatment in adult T2DM, prediabetes, and MetS. The MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Central Register of Control Trials, and Scopus databases were searched from inception to September 2022. The primary efficacy outcomes were hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) and fasting blood glucose (FBG). The corrected covered area (CCA) was used to assess overlap. Mean differences were pooled across individual RCTs using a random-effects model. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed for various CL preparation forms. Fourteen SRMAs of 61 individual RCTs were included in the UR. The updated SRMA included 28 studies. The CCA was 11.54%, indicating high overlap across SRMAs. The updated SRMA revealed significant reduction in FBG and HbA1C with CL supplementation, obtaining a mean difference (95% confidence interval [CI]) of -8.129 (-12.175, -4.084) mg/dL and -0.134 (-0.304, -0.037) %, respectively. FBG and HbA1C levels decreased with all CL preparation forms as did other metabolic parameters levels. The results of the sensitivity and subgroup analyses were consistent with those of the main analysis. CL supplementation can significantly reduce FBG and HbA1C levels and other metabolic parameters in T2DM and mitigate related conditions, including prediabetes and MetS.

Thus, highlighting their function as supplementary therapeutic agents can be a novel strategy for clinical therapies. This systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials aimed to summarize the effect of macro-algae consumption on serum lipid profile, glycaemic control and anthropometric factors. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, a comprehensive search was performed for relevant studies published up to May 2023. The Cochran's Q test and I-square (I<sup>2</sup> ) tests were used to evaluate heterogeneity across the included studies. The meta-analysis was conducted using random-effects model (DerSimonian and Laird), and weighted mean difference (WMD) was considered as the pooled effect size. Out of 8602 papers in the initial screening, eight clinical trials with a total of 438 participants were included into this meta-analysis. The results indicated that macro-algae supplementation significantly decreased serum levels of total cholesterol (TC) (WMD = -6.7 mg/dL; 95% CI: -12.59, -0.80; item = 0.026) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) (WMD = -8.25 mg/dL; 95% CI: -15.38, -1.12; p-value = .023).

We aimed to assess the association between vitamin D status and all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease in people with type 2 diabetes. We did a systematic search in PubMed, Scopus, CENTRAL, and Web of Science until May 2022. We selected 1) cohort studies investigating the association between serum 25(OH)D concentration and mortality or cardiovascular disease in people with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes and 2) randomized trials of vitamin D supplementation in these patients. We used random-effects pairwise meta-analyses to calculate summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). 21 cohort studies and 6 randomized trials were included. Compared with sufficient vitamin D status (≥50 nmol/L), the RR of all-cause mortality was 1.36 (95% CI: 1.23, 1.49; n = 11 studies, GRADE = moderate) for vitamin D insufficiency (25 to <50 nmol/L), and 1.58 (1.33, 1.83; n = 16, GRADE = moderate) for deficiency (<25 nmol/L). Similar findings were observed for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but not for cancer mortality. The certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Dose-response meta-analyses indicated nonlinear associations, with the lowest risk at 25(OH)D ∼60 nmol/L for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Supplementation with vitamin D did not reduce the risk of all-cause mortality (RR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.79, 1.16; risk difference per 1000 patients: 3 fewer, 95% CI: 16 fewer, 12 more; n = 6 trials with 7316 participants; GRADE = low) or the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity (very low- to low-certainty evidence). Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are associated with a higher risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes.

37447376,Evidence-Based Dietary Practices to Improve Osteoarthritis Symptoms: An Umbrella Review.,"While there is some research investigating whole foods or diets that are easily understood and accessible to patients with osteoarthritis, specific nutrients or nutraceuticals are more commonly identified. Unfortunately, guidelines and evidence surrounding individual nutrients, extracts, and nutraceuticals are conflicting and are more difficult to interpret and implement for patients with osteoarthritis. The purpose of this umbrella review is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the existing evidence of whole foods and dietary patterns effects on osteoarthritis-related outcomes to inform evidence-based recommendations for healthcare professionals and identify areas where more research is warranted. A literature search identified relevant systematic reviews/meta-analyses using five databases from inception to May 2022. Five systematic reviews/meta-analyses were included in the current umbrella review. Most evidence supported the Mediterranean diet improving osteoarthritis-related outcomes (e.g., pain, stiffness, inflammation, biomarkers of cartilage degeneration). There was little to no evidence supporting the effects of fruits and herbs on osteoarthritis-related outcomes; however, there was some suggestion that specific foods could potentiate symptom improvement through antioxidative mechanisms.

Despite growing success of salt iodization programs, a 2022 meta-analysis found that 53% of pregnant patients worldwide continue to have insufficient iodine intake during pregnancy. A 2021 randomized controlled trial (RCT) found that MIS in women with mild iodine deficiency led to iodine sufficiency and positive effects on maternal thyroglobulin. A 2021 cohort study of MIS initiated prior to pregnancy was associated with lower thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), higher FT3, and FT4. Other cohort studies, however, found that neither salt iodization nor MIS were adequate to meet pregnancy iodine needs. Data have been mixed regarding maternal iodine status and pregnancy outcomes in patients of MMID. Meta-analyses have not shown any clear benefit on infant neurocognitive outcomes with MIS of MMID patients. A 2023 meta-analysis found that the prevalence of excess iodine intake in pregnancy was 52%. MMID continues to exist during pregnancy. Salt iodization alone may be insufficient to ensure adequate iodine status during pregnancy. There is an absence of high-quality data to support routine MIS in areas of MMID. However, patients with specialized diets (vegan, nondairy, no seafood, noniodized salt, and so on) may be at risk for inadequate iodine status in pregnancy.

In addition, we propose distinct populations for future interventions with VitD. The literature concerning VitD supplementation in the prevention, treatment, and remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) spans decades, is complex, and is often contradictory with mixed findings upon intervention. By association, VitD status is powerfully predictive with deficient subjects reporting greater risk for T2DM, conversion to T2DM from prediabetes, and enhanced response to VitD therapy. Preclinical models strongly favor intervention with VitD owing to the pleiotropic influence of VitD on multiple systems. Additional research is crucial as there remain many questions unanswered that are related to VitD status and conditions such as T2DM. Future research must be conducted to better understand the potentially spurious relationships between VitD status, supplementation, sun exposure, health behaviors, and the diagnosis and management of T2DM. Public health practice can greatly benefit from a better understanding of the mechanisms by which we can reliably increase VitD status and how this can be used to develop education and improve health behaviors.",Hands JM; Corr PG; Frame LA,International journal of environmental research and public health,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37372772/,1,0,0,0,0,0

In this paper, we review the literature and summarize the effects of a high daily dose of 2 000 IU vitamin D on musculoskeletal outcomes in generally healthy adults, in men (≥50 years) and women (≥55 years) in the 5.3-year US VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) trial (n = 25 871) and women and men (≥70 years) in the 3-year European DO-HEALTH trial (n = 2 157). These studies found no benefit of 2 000 IU/d of supplemental vitamin D on nonvertebral fractures, falls, functional decline, or frailty. In VITAL, supplementation with 2 000 IU/d of vitamin D did not reduce the risk of total or hip fractures. In a subcohort of VITAL, supplemental vitamin D did not improve bone density or structure (n = 771) or physical performance measures (n = 1 054). In DO-HEALTH, which investigated additive benefits of vitamin D with omega-3 and a simple home exercise program, the 3 treatments combined showed a significant 39% decreased odds of becoming prefrail compared to the control.

37325954,Nutritional Interventions: Dietary Protein Needs and Influences on Skeletal Muscle of Older Adults.,"This narrative review describes foundational and emerging evidence of how dietary protein intakes may influence muscle-related attributes of older adults. PubMed was used to identify pertinent research. Among medically stable older adults, protein intakes below the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) (0.8 g/kg body weight [BW]/d) exacerbate age-related reductions in muscle size, quality, and function. Dietary patterns with total protein intakes at or moderately above the RDA, including one or preferably more meals containing sufficient dietary protein to maximize protein anabolism, promote muscle size and function. Some observational studies suggest protein intakes from 1.0 to 1.6 g/kg BW/d may promote greater muscle strength and function more so than muscle size. Experimental findings from randomized controlled feeding trials indicate protein intakes greater than the RDA (averaging ~1.3 g/kg BW/d) do not influence indices of lean body mass or muscle and physical functions with non-stressed conditions, but positively influence changes in lean body mass with purposeful catabolic (energy restriction) or anabolic (resistance exercise training) stressors. Among older adults with diagnosed medical conditions or acute illness, specialized protein or amino acid supplements that stimulate muscle protein synthesis and improve protein nutritional status may attenuate the loss of muscle mass and function and improve survival of malnourished patients. Observational studies favor animal versus plant protein sources for sarcopenia-related parameters. Quantity, quality, and patterning of dietary protein consumed by older adults with varied metabolic states, and hormonal and health status influence the nutritional needs and therapeutic use of protein to support muscle size and function.",Campbell WW; Deutz NEP; Volpi E; Apovian CM,"The journals of gerontology.

37308791,Inositol supplementation for the prevention and treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Inositol is a potential new therapeutic agent for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), but its effectiveness is still controversial. The aim of the report was to evaluate the effectiveness of inositol to preventing or reducing the severity of GDM. We searched PubMed, EmBase, Web of science, Cochrane library databases, Clinicaltrials.gov, and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness of inositol supplementation to prevent and treat GDM. This meta-analysis was performed using the random-effects model. A total of 7 RCTs (1319 pregnant women at high risk of GDM) were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis found that inositol supplementation resulted in a significantly lower incidence of GDM in the inositol versus the control group (odds ratio [OR] 0.40; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24-0.67; P = 0.0005). The inositol group had improved fasting glucose oral glucose tolerance test (FG OGTT; mean difference [MD] = - 3.20; 95% CI - 4.45 to - 1.95; P < 0.00001), 1-h OGTT (MD = - 7.24; 95% CI - 12.23 to - 2.25; P = 0.004), and 2-h OGTT (MD = - 7.15; 95% CI - 12.86 to - 1.44; P = 0.01) results. Inositol also reduced the risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension (OR 0.37; 95% CI 0.18-0.75; P = 0.006) and preterm birth (OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.18-0.69; P = 0.003). A meta-analysis of 4 RCTs including 320 GDM patients showed that the patients' insulin resistance (P < 0.05) and neonatal hypoglycemia risk (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01-0.88; P = 0.04) were lower in the inositol than in the control group.

37302723,Effects of Vitamin D Supplementation in Diabetic Kidney Disease: A Systematic Review.,"Diabetes Mellitus is a highly prevalent condition in which Diabetes Mellitus type 2 is the most common. Diabetic Kidney Disease is one of the most relevant complications and affects approximately one-third of patients with Diabetes Mellitus. It is characterized by increased urinary protein excretion and a decrease in glomerular filtration rate, assessed by serum creatinine levels. Recent studies have shown that vitamin D levels are low in these patients. This study aimed to conduct a systematic review of the effects of vitamin D supplementation on proteinuria and creatinine, which are important markers for assessing the severity of kidney disease in patients with Diabetic Kidney Disease. PUBMED, EMBASE, and COCHRANE databases were consulted, Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines were followed, and the COCHRANE toll for bias assessment was applied. Six papers were quantitative studies and fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review. The results showed that vitamin D supplementation of 50,000 I.U./week for 8 weeks effectively reduced proteinuria and creatinine in patients with Diabetic Kidney Disease, particularly in patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 2. Vitamin D supplementation is beneficial for patients with Diabetic Kidney Disease by having essential effects on disease-related inflammatory markers, such as the reduction of proteinuria and creatinine. However, more clinical trials must be conducted to evaluate the intervention among more significant numbers of patients.",de Oliveira E Silva Ullmann T; Ramalho BJ; Laurindo LF; Tofano RJ; Rubira CJ; Guiguer EL; Barbalho SM; Flato UAP; Sloan KP; Araujo AC,Journal of renal nutrition : the official journal of the Council on Renal Nutrition of the National Kidney Foundation,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37302723/,0,1,0,0,0,0

Red yeast rice (RYR) is a nutraceutical widely used as a lipid-lowering dietary supplement. The main cholesterol-lowering components of RYR are monacolins, particularly monacolin K, which is structurally identical to lovastatin and targets the same key enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis. RYR supplementation reduces LDL-C levels by approximately 15-34% versus placebo, with a similar effect to low-dose, first-generation statins in subjects with mild-to-moderate dyslipidemia. RYR has also demonstrated beneficial reductions of up to 45% versus placebo in the risk of ASCVD events in secondary prevention studies. RYR at a dose that provides about 3 mg/d of monacolin K is well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that of low-dose statins. RYR is therefore a treatment option for lowering LDL-C levels and ASCVD risk for people with mild-to-moderate hypercholesterolemia who are ineligible for statin therapy, particularly those who are unable to implement lifestyle modifications, and also for people who are eligible for statin therapy but who are unwilling to take a pharmacologic therapy.",Cicero AFG; Fogacci F; Stoian AP; Toth PP,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37242171/,1,0,0,0,0,0

37240008,Consideration for Flavonoid-Containing Dietary Supplements to Tackle Deficiency and Optimize Health.,"Randomized clinical trials (RCT) and observational studies have highlighted the importance of flavonoid consumption for human health. Several studies have associated a high intake of dietary flavonoids with (a) enhanced metabolic and cardiovascular health, (b) enhanced cognitive and vascular endothelial functions, (c) an improved glycemic response in type 2 diabetes mellitus, and (d) a reduced risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Since flavonoids belong to a broad and diverse family of polyphenolic plant molecules-with more than 6000 compounds interspersed in the human diet-researchers are still uncertain whether the intake of single, individual polyphenols or a large combination of them (i.e., synergistic action) can produce the greatest health benefits for humans. Furthermore, studies have reported a poor bioavailability of flavonoid compounds in humans, which presents a major challenge for determining their optimal dosage, recommended intake, and, consequently, their therapeutic value. Especially because of their scarce bioavailability from foods-along with the overall declining food quality and nutrient density in foods-the role of flavonoid supplementation may become increasingly important for human health. Although research shows that dietary supplements can be a highly useful tool to complement diets that lack sufficient amounts of important nutrients, some caution is warranted regarding possible interactions with prescription and non-prescription drugs, especially when taken concurrently. Herein, we discuss the current scientific basis for using flavonoid supplementation to improve health as well as the limitations related to high intakes of dietary flavonoids.",Solnier J; Chang C; Pizzorno J,International journal of molecular sciences,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37240008/,1,0,0,0,0,0

This study aimed to summarize the effectiveness of oral zinc supplementation in improving cardio-metabolic risk markers in people with T2DM. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to April 2023, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). RCTs of type 2 diabetic adults (aged ≥18 years) comparing zinc supplementation with placebo were included. We excluded studies if not randomized, involved co-supplementation, and were conducted in children or pregnant women. Glycemic indices, lipid profiles, blood pressure, anthropometric measure, c-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, and serum zinc were extracted. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methods. We used a random-effect model to perform the dose-response analysis. Effect sizes were presented as mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). 22 studies (<i>n</i> = 1442 participants) were included. The certainty of the evidence was rated as moderate to high. Zinc supplementation significantly reduced glycemic indices: including two-hour postprandial glucose (2hpp) (mean difference (MD): -34.34 mg/dl; 95%CI: -51.61∼ -17.07), fast blood sugar (FBS) (MD: -23.32 mg/dl; 95% CI: -33.81∼ -12.83), and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (MD: -0.47; 95% CI: -0.71∼ -0.23). Zinc had a favorable effect on lipid profiles low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (MD: -10.76 mg/dl; CI: -17.79∼-3.73), triglyceride (TG) (MD: -18.23 mg/dl; CI: -32.81∼-3.65), total cholesterol (TC) (MD: -12.74 mg/dl; CI: -21.68∼-3.80), VLDL (MD: -5.39 mg/dl; CI: -7.35∼-3.43) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (MD: 4.04 mg/dl; CI: 0.96 ∼ 7.12).

37161897,The Possible Role of Β-Cell Senescence in the Development of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"This minireview discusses the very important biomedical problem of treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). T2D accounts for more than 90% of the total number of diagnosed cases of diabetes mellitus and can result from aging, inflammation, obesity and β-cell senescence. The main symptom of both T2D and type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an increase in blood glucose concentration. While T1D is insulin-dependent and is associated with the destruction of pancreatic β-cells, T2D does not require lifelong insulin administration. In this case, pancreatic β-cells are not destroyed, but their functional activity is deregulated. In T2D, metabolic stress increases the number of senescent β-cells while impairing glucose tolerance. The potential paracrine effects of senescent β-cells highlight the importance of the β-cell senescenceassociated secretory phenotype (SASP) in driving metabolic dysfunction. We believe that the main reason for the deregulation of the functional activity of pancreatic β-cells in T2D is associated with their ""aging"" or senescence, which may be induced by various stressors. We propose the use of peroxiredoxin 6 as a new senolytic drug, and the role of β-cell senescence in the development of T2D is discussed in this review.",Novoselova EG; Lunin SM; Khrenov MO; Glushkova OV; Novoselova TV; Parfenyuk SB,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37161897/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Uncurbed diabetes or incessant hyperglycemic condition can lead to severe complications, including renal damage, visual impairment, cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, etc., which promotes diabetes-associated morbidity and mortality rates. The therapeutic management of diabetes includes conventional medications and nutraceuticals as complementary therapies. Nutraceuticals are bioactive compounds derived from food sources that have health-promoting properties and are instrumental in the management and treatment of various maladies. Nutraceuticals are clinically exploited to tackle DM pathogenesis, and the clinical evidence suggests that nutraceuticals can modulate biochemical parameters related to diabetes pathogenesis and comorbidities. Hypoglycemic medicines are designed to mitigate DM in traditional medicinal practice. This review intends to emphasize and comment on the various therapeutic strategies available to manage this chronic condition, conventional drugs, and the potential role of nutraceuticals in managing the complexity of the disease and reducing the risk of complications. In contrast to conventional antihyperglycemic drugs, nutraceutical supplements offer a higher efficacy and lesser adverse effects.

37121469,Effect of Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids on Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients with Diabetes: A Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"The current guidelines recommend that people consume 2 or more servings of fat-rich fish per week to obtain enough omega-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids to prevent cardiovascular events. However, the cardiovascular benefits of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in patients with diabetes are unclear, and related large-scale trials have produced conflicting results. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials that attempted to assess the effects of ω-3 fatty acid supplementation on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with diabetes. In PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, we searched for data from all randomized controlled trials on ω-3 fatty acids and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with diabetes published before July 2022. Eight eligible studies involving 57,754 participants were ultimately included. Meta-analysis showed that ω-3 fatty acid supplementation reduces cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in patients with diabetes (rate ration [RR] = 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90, 0.97; P = 0.0009). Among them, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), but not EPA plus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), significantly reduced the risk of CVD in patients with diabetes (EPA [RR = 0.81; 95% CI: 0.73, 0.90; P=0.0001]). This meta-analysis suggests that ω-3 fatty acid supplementation is an effective strategy to prevent CVD in patients with diabetes, but further well-designed, large-scale randomized controlled trials are necessary to evaluate the safety of ω-3 fatty acid supplementation, and its effect on atrial fibrillation.

It not only functions in free form but also serves as a critical component of sphingolipids which participate in many biological processes such as cell membrane formation, apoptosis, and neurotransmission. Recent studies show that nervonic acid supplementation is not only beneficial to human health but also can improve the many medical conditions such as neurological diseases, cancers, diabetes, obesity, and their complications. Nervonic acid and its sphingomyelins serve as a special material for myelination in infants and remyelination patients with multiple sclerosis. Besides, the administration of nervonic acid is reported to reduce motor disorder in mice with Parkinson's disease and limit weight gain. Perturbations of nervonic acid and its sphingolipids might lead to the pathogenesis of many diseases and understanding these mechanisms is critical for investigating potential therapeutic approaches for such diseases.

37111098,Folate Supplementation in Women with Pre-Existing Diabetes.,"Folate supplementation in the periconceptual period is the standard of care for the prevention of neural tube defects. To support dietary folate intake, some countries have introduced mandatory folic acid fortification of food products. Robust evidence supports the additional use of a low-dose folic acid supplement (0.4 mg/day) in all women from 2-3 months preconception until the end of the 12th week of gestation. For women with pre-existing diabetes, high-dose folic acid supplementation (5 mg/day) is recommended in some, but not all international guidelines. The recommendation is made based on consensus opinion and reflects the increased risk of neural tube defects in pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes. However, there is limited evidence to clarify the high-risk groups that benefit from high-dose folic acid versus those that do not. There are also some data to suggest that high-dose folic acid may be harmful to mothers and offspring, although this issue remains controversial. This narrative review explores the evidence that supports the recommendation for women with pre-existing diabetes to take high-dose folic acid in the periconceptual period. It explores the potential benefits of high-dose supplemental folate beyond the prevention of neural tube defects, and also the potential adverse impacts of high-dose folate use. These topics are considered with a specific focus on the issues that are pertinent to women with pre-existing diabetes. Based on the available evidence, a pragmatic approach to the use of folic acid supplements in women with pre-existing diabetes during the periconception period is suggested. The need for comprehensive preconception care that optimises glycaemic control and addresses other modifiable risk factors before pregnancy is emphasized.",Perera N; Rudland VL; Simmons D; Price SAL,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37111098/,1,0,0,0,0,0

PubMed, Scopus, Web of Sciences and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up until December 14, 2022. The effect sizes were pooled using an inverse-variance random-effects model. The methodological quality of studies as well as the quality of evidence was assessed using standard tools. Thirty-two RCTs met the established inclusion criteria. Overall, compared with the respective control groups, probiotic/synbiotic supplementation resulted in a significant reduction in body weight (weighted mean difference [WMD]: -0.50 kg; 95% CI: -0.83, -0.17; I<sup>2</sup> = 79.8%, n = 27 studies]), body mass index (WMD: -0.24 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; 95% CI: -0.39, -0.09; I<sup>2</sup> = 85.7%, n = 30 studies), and waist circumference (WMD: -0.90 cm; 95% CI: -1.13, -0.52; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%, n = 11 studies). However, hip circumference and waist to hip ratio were not significantly improved. Our analysis revealed that probiotic/synbiotic supplementation may assist with weight management in patients with diabetes, especially when consumed at higher doses, in younger adults, and in participants with obesity. However, more studies are needed to elucidate the anti-obesity effects of specific strains of probiotics/synbiotics.",Soltani S; Ashoori M; Dehghani F; Meshkini F; Clayton ZS; Abdollahi S,BMC endocrine disorders,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37085813/,0,1,0,1,0,0
37080887,A Scoping Review of Vitamin D for Nonskeletal Health: A Framework for Evidence-based Clinical Practice.,"Low serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D] levels are prevalent worldwide. Although the benefits of vitamin D supplementation have focused on skeletal disorders (eg, rickets, osteomalacia, osteoporosis), emerging evidence for nonskeletal health merits further discussion. The purpose of this review was to critically examine the vitamin D supplementation literature pertaining to nonskeletal health to help guide clinicians. A scoping review that included observational studies and randomized clinical trials (RCTs) was performed. Evidence from meta-analyses and individual RCTs are discussed, and controversies and future directions are considered. 25(OH)D deficiency is a ubiquitous condition associated with multiple nonskeletal diseases, including cardiometabolic (heart disease, diabetes, and kidney disease), immune (HIV/AIDS and cancer), lung (from traditional chronic disorders to coronavirus disease 2019), and gut diseases. Vitamin D deficiency also affects health across the life span (children, pregnant, and elderly), mental illness, and reproduction in both men and women. In contrast, vitamin D supplementation does not necessarily improve major medical outcomes, even when low 25(OH)D levels are treated. Screening for 25(OH)D status remains an important practice, primarily for high-risk patients (eg, elderly, women with osteoporosis, people with low exposure to sunlight). It is reasonable to supplement with vitamin D to treat 25(OH)D deficiency, such that if beneficial nonskeletal health occurs, this may be considered as a coadjutant instead of the central tenet of the disease. Furthermore, optimizing dosing regimens is an important clinical consideration. Although 25(OH)D deficiency is prevalent in nonskeletal diseases, there is no uniform evidence that vitamin D supplementation improves major medical outcomes, even when low 25(OH)D levels are corrected.

37062706,The Leap of Inulin Fructans from Food Industry to Medical Application.,"As a dietary supplement, the efficacy of prebiotics has become a hot issue in recent years. Inulin is one of internationally recognized prebiotics and belongs to a group of non-digestible and fermentable carbohydrates. Currently, the food industry is increasingly using prebiotic inulin as a health-promoting substrate, not just as food supplement. In addition, inulin has also shown great promise in the treatment of various diseases. This article reviews the application of inulin in the food industry and summarizes physiological function of inulin. Through the review and prospect of the research on obesity, diabetes and mental illness, it provides the theoretical basis for the joint development of inulin in food industry and medical application.",Zhou X; Wang S; Xu C; Li J; Liu H; He L; Zhong S; Li K,Chemistry & biodiversity,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37062706/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37057658,Dietary supplementation with resistant starch contributes to intestinal health.,"Resistant starch has received much attention recently as a healthy carbohydrate component of the diet. Resistant starch is not digested in the small intestine and can thus affect the gut microbiota of the host because of its fermentability. This review summarizes the interactions along the resistant starch-gut microbiota-host axis to help understand the health effects of resistant starch. Recent studies indicate that resistant starch can be a helpful dietary component for special disease states like diabetes, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, constipation, and colitis. Its health effects are associated with modulation of the gut microbiota, and with gut microbes converting resistant starch into active and bioavailable metabolites that promote intestinal health. The results from human clinical trials and studies in animal models indicate that supplementation of the diet with resistant starch in different metabolic diseases help remodel gut microbiota, especially increasing short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria, and produce bioactive metabolites like SCFA, bile acids, and amino acids responsible for a variety of health effects. The gut microbiota and microbial metabolites probably mediate the effects of resistant starch on intestinal health.",Wen JJ; Li MZ; Nie SP,Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37057658/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37049610,Carnosine and Beta-Alanine Supplementation in Human Medicine: Narrative Review and Critical Assessment.,"The dipeptide carnosine is a physiologically important molecule in the human body, commonly found in skeletal muscle and brain tissue. Beta-alanine is a limiting precursor of carnosine and is among the most used sports supplements for improving athletic performance. However, carnosine, its metabolite <i>N</i>-acetylcarnosine, and the synthetic derivative zinc-L-carnosine have recently been gaining popularity as supplements in human medicine. These molecules have a wide range of effects-principally with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiglycation, anticarbonylation, calcium-regulatory, immunomodulatory and chelating properties. This review discusses results from recent studies focusing on the impact of this supplementation in several areas of human medicine. We queried PubMed, Web of Science, the National Library of Medicine and the Cochrane Library, employing a search strategy using database-specific keywords. Evidence showed that the supplementation had a beneficial impact in the prevention of sarcopenia, the preservation of cognitive abilities and the improvement of neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, the improvement of diabetes mellitus parameters and symptoms of oral mucositis was seen, as well as the regression of esophagitis and taste disorders after chemotherapy, the protection of the gastrointestinal mucosa and the support of <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> eradication treatment. However, in the areas of senile cataracts, cardiovascular disease, schizophrenia and autistic disorders, the results are inconclusive.",Cesak O; Vostalova J; Vidlar A; Bastlova P; Student V,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37049610/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The primary outcome was glycemic control, i.e., serum glucose and insulin levels. Secondary outcomes were maternal weight gain, neonatal birth weight, and lipid parameters. Weighted mean difference (WMD) was used. Cochrane's Q test of heterogeneity and <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> were used to assess heterogeneity. Of the 843 papers retrieved, 14 (<i>n</i> = 854 women) met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. When compared with placebo, women receiving probiotic supplements had significantly lower mean fasting serum glucose, fasting serum insulin, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triglycerides, total cholesterol, and VLDL levels. Decreased neonatal birth weight was witnessed in supplements containing Lactobacillus acidophilus.

37047820,Uses of Papaya Leaf and Seaweed Supplementations for Controlling Glucose Homeostasis in Diabetes.,"Studies from laboratory animal models and complementary medical practices have implied that nutrients from special plants or herbs contain antidiabetic, antioxidant, anti-obese, anti-hypertensive, and anti-inflammatory properties. Seaweed and tropical papaya, which are widely available in Asian and Pacific countries, have been used as home remedies for centuries. The bioactive extracts from these plants contain vitamins A, C, B and E complexes, as well as polysaccharides, phenolic compounds, essential fatty acids, flavonoids, saponins, fucoidan, and phlorotannin. In this review, the authors examine the pathogenesis of diabetes characterized by hyperglycemia due to the dysregulation of glucose homeostasis, antidiabetic/antihyperglycemic seaweed or/and papaya derived bioactive phytochemicals and their proposed mechanisms of action in the management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The authors also propose combining papaya and seaweed to enhance their antidiabetic effects, leveraging the advantages of herb-to-herb combination. Papaya and seaweed have demonstrated antidiabetic effects through in vitro assays, cellular models, and animal studies despite the limited clinical trials. Nutraceuticals with antidiabetic effects, such as secondary metabolites isolated from seaweed and papaya, could be combined for a synergistic effect on T2DM management. However, the application of these compounds in their purified or mixed forms require further scientific studies to evaluate their efficacy against diabetes-related complications, such as hyperlipidemia, elevated free radicals, pro-inflammatory molecules, insulin insensitivity, and the degeneration of pancreatic beta cells.",Nyakundi BB; Yang J,International journal of molecular sciences,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37047820/,1,0,0,0,0,0

37004709,"Vitamin D: 100 years of discoveries, yet controversy continues.","Over the past 100 years, many major breakthroughs and discoveries have occurred in relation to vitamin D research. These developments include the cure of rickets in 1919, the discovery of vitamin D compounds, advances in vitamin D molecular biology, and improvements in our understanding of endocrine control of vitamin D metabolism. Furthermore, recommended daily allowances for vitamin D have been established and large clinical trials of vitamin D, aimed at clarifying the effect of Vitamin D in the prevention of multiple diseases, have been completed. However, disappointingly, these clinical trials have not fulfilled the expectations many had 10 years ago. In almost every trial, various doses and routes of administration did not show efficacy of vitamin D in preventing fractures, falls, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, asthma, and respiratory infections. Although concerns about side-effects of long-term high-dose treatments, such as hypercalcaemia and nephrocalcinosis, have been around for four decades, some trials from the past 5 years have had new and unexpected adverse events. These adverse events include increased fractures, falls, and hospitalisations in older people (aged >65 years). Several of these clinical trials were powered appropriately for a primary outcome but did not include dose response studies and were underpowered for secondary analyses. Furthermore, more attention should be paid to the safety of high doses of vitamin D supplementation, particularly in older people. In addition, despite universal recommendations by osteoporosis societies for combining calcium supplements with vitamin D there remains insufficient data about their efficacy and effect on fracture risk in the highest risk groups. More trials are needed for people with severe vitamin D deficiency (ie, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <25nmol/L [10ng/mL]).

36996691,Resveratrol may mildly improve renal function in the general adult population: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials.,"Whether renal health biomarkers can benefit from resveratrol supplements is unknown. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize evidence from randomized controlled trials investigating the effect of resveratrol supplementation on renal health biomarkers. We hypothesized that resveratrol supplementation is associated with improved renal health biomarkers. Four electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science, and Cochrane Central, were searched for relevant articles up to February 2023. The pooled effect sizes were estimated using a random effects model and expressed as weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% CI. In total, 32 articles were eligible for inclusion in the current meta-analysis. The pooled results indicated that resveratrol significantly decreased blood urea nitrogen (weighted mean difference [WMD]= -0.84 mg/dL; 95% CI, -1.48 to -0.20; P = .01; I<sup>2</sup> = 64.4%) and creatinine levels (WMD = -1.90 µmol/L; 95% CI, -3.59 to -0.21; P = .03; I<sup>2</sup>= 52.1%), and increased glomerular filtration rate (WMD = 7.58 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>; 95% CI, 5.25-9.91; P < .001; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). The favorable change of blood urea nitrogen was significant in studies with short follow-up duration (12 weeks or less), with lower doses of resveratrol (less than 500 mg/d), and those conducted in patients with diabetes. However, higher doses of resveratrol are needed to observe significant reductions in creatinine. No significant change was observed in albumin, total protein, and uric acid concentrations. This meta-analysis provides a low certainty of evidence indicating a mild renal protective effect of resveratrol in adults. Further high-quality evidence in patients with impaired renal function and estimates of mortality risk in these patients is required before resveratrol can be advocated as an adjuvant therapy.",Abdollahi S; Vajdi M; Meshkini F; Vasmehjani AA; Sangsefidi ZS; Clark CCT; Soltani S,"Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)",2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36996691/,0,1,0,1,0,1
36985818,Exploring Edible Mushrooms for Diabetes: Unveiling Their Role in Prevention and Treatment.,"Diabetes mellitus is a complex illness in which the body does not create enough insulin to control blood glucose levels. Worldwide, this disease is life-threatening and requires low-cost, side-effect-free medicine. Due to adverse effects, many synthetic hypoglycemic medications for diabetes fail. Mushrooms are known to contain natural bioactive components that may be anti-diabetic; thus, scientists are now targeting them. Mushroom extracts, which improve immune function and fight cancer, are becoming more popular. Mushroom-derived functional foods and dietary supplements can delay the onset of potentially fatal diseases and help treat pre-existing conditions, which leads to the successful prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes, which is restricted to the breakdown of complex polysaccharides by pancreatic-amylase and the suppression of intestinal-glucosidase. Many mushroom species are particularly helpful in lowering blood glucose levels and alleviating diabetes symptoms. Hypoglycaemic effects have been observed in investigations on <i>Agaricussu brufescens</i>, <i>Agaricus bisporus</i>, <i>Cordyceps sinensis</i>, <i>Inonotus obliqus</i>, <i>Coprinus comatus</i>, <i>Ganoderma lucidum</i>, <i>Phellinus linteus</i>, <i>Pleurotus</i> spp., <i>Poria cocos</i>, and <i>Sparassis crispa</i>. For diabetics, edible mushrooms are high in protein, vitamins, and minerals and low in fat and cholesterol.

36963861,A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of probiotics on oxidative stress in healthy adults.,"The oxidative stress (OS) theory of disease stipulates that a chronic imbalance in the ratio of oxidants to antioxidants in the cellular environment leads to a variety of debilitating conditions, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular and liver diseases. Metabolites in the gut microbiome have been associated with increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS). Many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have thus investigated the potential of probiotics as a nutraceutical intervention to improve parameters of OS. The objective of this paper is to review relevant human RCTs exploring the potential of probiotic supplementation to prevent OS in metabolically healthy individuals. This systematic review and meta-analysis was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021297210). The PubMed database was searched using keywords related to probiotics and OS. In total, out of the 652 studies were screened, 9 respected the inclusion criteria. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (SMD: 0.83 mmol/L, 95% CI: 0.25-1.40, p = 0.005) and glutathione (GSH) (SMD: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.13-0.77, p = 0.006) are improved with probiotic ingestion, although there are no alterations in superoxide dismutase (SOD) (SMD: 0.33, 95% CI: -0.27-0.93, p = 0.28). Decreases in plasma concentrations of the OS biomarker malondialdehyde (MDA) (SMD: -0.55, 95% CI: -1.11-0.00, p = 0.05) are also detected.

Relevant studies were obtained by searching the PubMed, SCOPUS, Embase, and Web of Science databases (from inception to January 2022). Weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis, and publication bias were reported using standard methods. Pooled analysis of 14 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) revealed that guar gum supplementation led to significant reductions in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (WMD: -0.47 mg/dL, 95% CI: -0.75, -0.18, p = 0.001). However, there was no effect on fasting blood sugar (FBS), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and body mass among adults in comparison with the control group. A subgroup analysis demonstrated that intervention in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and high supplementation dosages (>15 g/d) significantly decreased FBS concentrations, but not in other subgroups.

36921399,"A review on Impact of dietary interventions, drugs, and traditional herbal supplements on the gut microbiome.","The gut microbiome is the community of healthy, and infectious organisms in the gut and its interaction in the host gut intestine (GI) environment. The balance of microbial richness with beneficial microbes is very important to perform healthy body functions like digesting food, controlling metabolism, and precise immune function. Alternately, this microbial dysbiosis occurs due to changes in the physiochemical condition, substrate avidity, and drugs. Moreover, various categories of diet such as ""plant-based"", ""animal-based"", ""western"", ""mediterranean"", and various drugs (antibiotic and common drugs) also contribute to maintaining microbial flora inside the gut. The imbalance (dysbiosis) in the microbiota of the GI tract can cause several disorders (such as diabetes, obesity, cancer, inflammation, and so on). Recently, the major interest is to use prebiotic, probiotic, postbiotic, and herbal supplements to balance such microbial community in the GI tract. But, there has still a large gap in understanding the microbiome function, and its relation to the host diet, drugs, and herbal supplements to maintain the healthy life of the host.

36918792,An Overview of Dietary Flavonoids as a Nutraceutical Nanoformulation Approach to Life-threatening Diseases.,"Obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer are just a few chronic diseases for which proper nutrition has been demonstrated to be a crucial factor in prevention. Flavonoids, found in many fruits and vegetables, are a type of dietary polyphenol with potent antioxidant activity and anti-carcinogenic characteristics. Flavonoids and foods rich in flavonoids have been shown in recent years to have profound effects on cognitive function, aging, and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. Foods high in flavonoids, such as green tea, chocolate, blueberries, and other fruits and vegetables, have ameliorated symptoms of cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia in several animal models. As a result of their ability to prevent neuronal death generated by neurotoxic chemicals such as free radicals and β-amyloid proteins. Furthermore, flavonoids are also effective in slowing the evolution of clinical signs of neurodegenerative illnesses. In addition, flavonoids can improve lipid profiles by preventing the oxidation of low-density lipoproteins, and these antioxidant capabilities are responsible for their therapeutic impacts. Finally, the potential of flavonoids to induce vasodilation and control apoptotic processes in the endothelium is another way in which they benefit the cardiovascular system. This review aims to offer up-to-date information on categorizing these compounds, their primary methods of action in the human body, and their positive impacts on the management of neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular disorders, and other life-threatening diseases.",Singh S; Ahuja A; Sharma H; Maheshwari P,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36918792/,1,0,0,0,0,0

36898635,The effect of curcumin supplementation on weight loss and anthropometric indices: an umbrella review and updated meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials.,"Curcumin supplementation may promote weight loss and ameliorate obesity-related complications through its antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. An umbrella review and updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to evaluate the effect of curcumin supplementation on anthropometric indices. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses (SRMAs) of RCTs were identified from electronic databases (Medline, Scopus, Cochrane, and Google Scholar) up to 31 March, 2022, without language restriction. SRMAs were included if they assessed curcumin supplementation on any of the following: BMI, body weight (BW), or waist circumference (WC). Subgroup analyses were performed, stratifying by patient types, severity of obesity, and curcumin formula. The study protocol was a priori registered. From an umbrella review, 14 SRMAs with 39 individual RCTs were included with a high degree of overlap. In addition, searching was updated from the last search of included SRMAs in April 2021 up to 31 March, 2022, and we found 11 additional RCTs, bringing the total up to 50 RCTs included in the updated meta-analyses. Of these, 21 RCTs were deemed of high risk of bias. Curcumin supplementation significantly reduced BMI, BW, and WC with mean differences (MDs) of -0.24 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (95% CI: -0.32, -0.16 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), -0.59 kg (95% CI: -0.81, -0.36 kg), and -1.32 cm (95% CI: -1.95, -0.69 cm), respectively. The bioavailability-enhanced form reduced BMI, BWs, and WC more, with MDs of -0.26 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (95% CI: -0.38, -0.13 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), -0.80 kg (95% CI: -1.38, -0.23 kg) and -1.41 cm (95% CI: -2.24, -0.58 cm), respectively. Significant effects were also seen in subgroups of patients, especially in adults with obesity and diabetes.

36862209,Calcifediol: a review of its pharmacological characteristics and clinical use in correcting vitamin D deficiency.,"In addition to the role of vitamin D in bone mineralization, calcium and phosphate homeostasis, and skeletal health, evidence suggests an association between vitamin D deficiency and a wide range of chronic conditions. This is of clinical concern given the substantial global prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency has traditionally been treated with vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (cholecalciferol) or vitamin D<sub>2</sub> (ergocalciferol). Calcifediol (25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub>) has recently become available more widely. By means of targeted literature searches of PubMed, this narrative review overviews the physiological functions and metabolic pathways of vitamin D, examines the differences between calcifediol and vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, and highlights clinical trials conducted with calcifediol in patients with bone disease or other conditions. For supplemental use in the healthy population, calcifediol can be used at doses of up to 10 µg per day for children ≥ 11 years and adults and up to 5 µg/day in children 3-10 years. For therapeutic use of calcifediol under medical supervision, the dose, frequency and duration of treatment is determined according to serum 25(OH)D concentrations, condition, type of patient and comorbidities. Calcifediol differs pharmacokinetically from vitamin D<sub>3</sub> in several ways. It is independent of hepatic 25-hydroxylation and thus is one step closer in the metabolic pathway to active vitamin D. At comparable doses to vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, calcifediol achieves target serum 25(OH)D concentrations more rapidly and in contrast to vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, it has a predictable and linear dose-response curve irrespective of baseline serum 25(OH)D concentrations. The intestinal absorption of calcifediol is relatively preserved in patients with fat malabsorption and it is more hydrophilic than vitamin D<sub>3</sub> and thus is less prone to sequestration in adipose tissue. Calcifediol is suitable for use in all patients with vitamin D deficiency and may be preferable to vitamin D<sub>3</sub> for patients with obesity, liver disease, malabsorption and those who require a rapid increase in 25(OH)D concentrations.",Jodar E; Campusano C; de Jongh RT; Holick MF,European journal of nutrition,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36862209/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36857810,"Vitamin D: immune function, inflammation, infections and auto-immunity.","Vitamin D plays an active role beyond mineral metabolism and skeletal health, including regulation of the immune system. Vitamin D deficiency is widely prevalent, and observational studies link low vitamin D status to a risk of infections and auto-immune disorders. Reports indicate an inverse relationship between vitamin D status and such conditions. This review details vitamin D signalling interactions with the immune system and provides experimental and clinical evidence evaluating vitamin D status, vitamin D supplementation and host susceptibility to infections, inflammation and auto-immunity. The published literature including related reviews, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomised controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies and basic science reports have been synthesised. Meta-analyses of observational studies have demonstrated a link between low vitamin D status and risk of acute respiratory infections, COVID-19 disorders, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes (T1DM), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), systemic lupus erythematosus and other auto-immune disorders. Observational studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation may protect against several infectious and auto-immune conditions. Meta-analyses of RCTs had mixed results, demonstrating a small protective role for vitamin D supplementation against acute respiratory infections, especially in those with vitamin D deficiency and children, and providing modest benefits for the management of T1DM and IBD. Vitamin D status is inversely associated with the incidence of several infectious and auto-immune conditions. Supplementation is recommended for those with vitamin D deficiency or at high risk of deficiency, and it might provide additional benefit in acute respiratory infections and certain auto-immune conditions.",Johnson CR; Thacher TD,Paediatrics and international child health,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36857810/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36839358,Assessing the Highest Level of Evidence from Randomized Controlled Trials in Omega-3 Research.,"Over the years, there has been heightened interest in the health benefits of <i>n</i>-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in reducing chronic diseases such as, cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, type 2 diabetes, and acute macular degeneration (AMD). Due to inconsistent findings in the evidence, a review to critically examine the plethora of evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in <i>n</i>-3 PUFA research was undertaken. The aim of this review is to study the highest level of evidence and to identify gaps in <i>n</i>-3 PUFA research. RCTs were originally designed for pharmaceutical research and later adopted for nutrition and food-related research. RCTs with active diseases assume that <i>n</i>-3 PUFA will have ""drug"" like effects, and this high expectation may have led to the inconsistent evidence in the literature. The inconsistency in the literature may be related to varying doses of <i>n</i>-3 PUFA, sources of <i>n</i>-3 PUFA (food vs. supplement; plant vs. marine), type of <i>n</i>-3 PUFA (mixture vs. purified), trial duration, population characteristics, sample size, and genetic variation. For future research, there is a need to distinguish between primary and secondary prevention, and to focus RCTs on primary prevention of chronic diseases by <i>n</i>-3 PUFA which is lacking in the literature.",Sahye-Pudaruth S; Ma DWL,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36839358/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36839340,Controversial Impact of Vitamin D Supplementation on Reducing Insulin Resistance and Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes in Patients with Prediabetes: A Systematic Review.,"Prediabetes has become a worldwide health problem. Multiple clinical trials have been conducted to determine the potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation in preventing the conversion to diabetes, but the results are inconsistent. The aims of this study were to evaluate the current knowledge and to suggest recommendations for researchers on designing future trials regarding that matter. Four databases were searched for randomized control trials from the last 10 years about vitamin D and insulin resistance. The systematic electronic literature search identified 2645 studies, of which thirty-eight qualified for full-text reading and discussion. Finally, eight trials were included. Final results of seven trials reported that supplementation of vitamin D does not reduce insulin resistance nor reduces the risk of diabetes mellitus type 2 development in prediabetes. Only one trial showed improvements in fasting glucose and HOMA-IR. Due to the great variation and biases in study designs, an unambiguous interpretation of the results is not possible. To eliminate those vulnerabilities in the future, we made certain suggestions for study design. Long-term and well-designed studies are still required.",Pieńkowska A; Janicka J; Duda M; Dzwonnik K; Lip K; Mędza A; Szlagatys-Sidorkiewicz A; Brzeziński M,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36839340/,0,1,0,0,0,0
36839303,Dietary Supplements Potentially Target Plasma Glutathione Levels to Improve Cardiometabolic Health in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review of Randomized Clinical Trials.,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) continue to be the leading cause of death in people with diabetes mellitus. Severely suppressed intracellular antioxidant defenses, including low plasma glutathione (GSH) levels, are consistently linked with the pathological features of diabetes such as oxidative stress and inflammation. In fact, it has already been established that low plasma GSH levels are associated with increased risk of CVD in people with diabetes. Dietary supplements are widely used and may offer therapeutic benefits for people with diabetes at an increased risk of developing CVDs. However, such information remains to be thoroughly scrutinized. Hence, the current systematic review explored prominent search engines, including PubMed and Google Scholar, for updated literature from randomized clinical trials reporting on the effects of dietary supplements on plasma GSH levels in people with diabetes. Available evidence indicates that dietary supplements, such as coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub>, selenium, curcumin, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin E or D, may potentially improve cardiometabolic health in patients with diabetes. Such beneficial effects are related to enhancing plasma GSH levels and reducing cholesterol, including biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation. However, available evidence is very limited and additional clinical studies are still required to validate these findings, including resolving issues related to the bioavailability of these bioactive compounds.",Dludla PV; Ziqubu K; Mabhida SE; Mazibuko-Mbeje SE; Hanser S; Nkambule BB; Basson AK; Pheiffer C; Tiano L; Kengne AP,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36839303/,0,1,0,0,0,0
36839219,Demand for Water-Soluble Vitamins in a Group of Patients with CKD versus Interventions and Supplementation-A Systematic Review.,"Increasingly, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is becoming an inevitable consequence of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. As the disease progresses, and through dialysis, the need for and loss of water-soluble vitamins both increase. This review article looks at the benefits and possible risks of supplementing these vitamins with the treatment of CKD. Data in the PubMed and Embase databases were analyzed. The keywords ""chronic kidney disease"", in various combinations, are associated with thiamin, riboflavin, pyridoxine, pantothenic acid, folates, niacin, cobalamin, and vitamin C. This review focuses on the possible use of water-soluble vitamin supplementation to improve pharmacological responses and the overall clinical condition of patients. The mechanism of supportive supplementation is based on reducing oxidative stress, covering the increased demand and losses resulting from the treatment method. In the initial period of failure (G2-G3a), it does not require intervention, but later, especially in the case of inadequate nutrition, the inclusion of supplementation with folate and cobalamin may bring benefits. Such supplementation seems to be a necessity in patients with stage G4 or G5 (uremia). Conversely, the inclusion of additional B6 supplementation to reduce CV risk may be considered. At stage 3b and beyond (stages 4-5), the inclusion of niacin at a dose of 400-1000 mg, depending on the patient's tolerance, is required to lower the phosphate level. The inclusion of supplementation with thiamine and other water-soluble vitamins, especially in peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients, is necessary for reducing dialysis losses. Allowing hemodialysis patients to take low doses of oral vitamin C effectively reduces erythropoietin dose requirements and improves anemia in functional iron-deficient patients. However, it should be considered that doses of B vitamins that are several times higher than the recommended dietary allowance of consumption may exacerbate left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in CKD patients. Taking into account the research conducted so far, it seems that the use of vitamin supplementation in CKD patients may have a positive impact on the treatment process and maintaining a disease-free condition.",Kędzierska-Kapuza K; Szczuko U; Stolińska H; Bakaloudi DR; Wierzba W; Szczuko M,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36839219/,0,1,0,0,0,0
36800965,Effect of vitamin E intake on glycemic control and insulin resistance in diabetic patients: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Since a 2014 meta-analysis, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of vitamin E intake on glycemic indices and insulin resistance in adults with diabetes have reached inconsistent conclusions. Therefore, we updated the previous meta-analysis to summarize the current evidence in this regard. Online databases including PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched to identify relevant studies published up to September 30, 2021, using relevant keywords. Random-effects models were used to obtain overall mean difference (MD) comparing vitamin E intake with a control group. In total, 38 RCTs with a total sample size of 2171 diabetic patients (1110 in vitamin E groups and 1061 in control groups) were included. Combining the results from 28 RCTs on fasting blood glucose, 32 RCTs on HbA1c, 13 RCTs on fasting insulin, and 9 studies on homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) showed a summary MD of -3.35 mg/dL (95% CI: -8.10 to 1.40, P = 0.16), -0.21% (95% CI: -0.33 to -0.09, P = 0.001), -1.05 µIU/mL (95% CI: -1.53 to -0.58, P < 0.001), and -0.44 (95% CI: -0.82 to -0.05, P = 0.02), respectively. This indicates a significant lowering effect of vitamin E on HbA1c, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR, while no significant effect on fasting blood glucose in diabetic patients. However, in subgroup analyses, we found that vitamin E intake significantly reduced fasting blood glucose in studies with an intervention duration of < 10 weeks. In conclusion, vitamin E intake has a beneficial role in improving HbA1c and insulin resistance in a population with diabetes. Moreover, short-term interventions with vitamin E have resulted in lower fasting blood glucose in these patients.

36790138,Antenatal dietary supplementation with myo-inositol for preventing gestational diabetes.,"Gestational diabetes with onset or first recognition during pregnancy is an increasing problem worldwide. Myo-inositol, an isomer of inositol, is a naturally occurring sugar commonly found in cereals, corn, legumes and meat. Myo-inositol is one of the intracellular mediators of the insulin signal and correlates with insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes. The potential beneficial effect of improving insulin sensitivity suggests that myo-inositol may be useful for women in preventing gestational diabetes. This is an update of a review first published in 2015. To assess if antenatal dietary supplementation with myo-inositol is safe and effective, for the mother and fetus, in preventing gestational diabetes. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP (17 March 2022) and the reference lists of retrieved studies. We included published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including cluster-RCTs and conference abstracts, assessing the effects of myo-inositol for the prevention of gestational diabetes in pregnant women. We included studies that compared any dose of myo-inositol, alone or in a combination preparation, with no treatment, placebo or another intervention. Quasi-randomised and cross-over trials were not eligible. We excluded women with pre-existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted the data. We checked the data for accuracy. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We included seven RCTs (one conducted in Ireland, six conducted in Italy) reporting on 1319 women who were 10 weeks to 24 weeks pregnant at the start of the studies. The studies had relatively small sample sizes and the overall risk of bias was low. For the primary maternal outcomes, meta-analysis showed that myo-inositol may reduce the incidence of gestational diabetes (risk ratio (RR) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 0.90; 6 studies, 1140 women) and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.61; 5 studies, 1052 women). However, the certainty of the evidence was low to very low. For the primary neonatal outcomes, only one study measured the risk of a large-for-gestational-age infant and found myo-inositol was associated with both appreciable benefit and harm (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.65 to 3.02; 1 study, 234 infants; low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported on the other primary neonatal outcomes (perinatal mortality, mortality or morbidity composite). For the secondary maternal outcomes, we are unclear about the effect of myo-inositol on weight gain during pregnancy (mean difference (MD) -0.25 kilogram (kg), 95% CI -1.26 to 0.75 kg; 4 studies, 831 women) and perineal trauma (RR 4.0, 95% CI 0.45 to 35.25; 1 study, 234 women) because the evidence was assessed as being very low-certainty. Further, myo-inositol may result in little to no difference in caesarean section (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.07; 4 studies, 829 women; low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported on the other secondary maternal outcomes (postnatal depression and the development of subsequent type 2 diabetes mellitus). For the secondary neonatal outcomes, meta-analysis showed no neonatal hypoglycaemia (RR 3.07, 95% CI 0.90 to 10.52; 4 studies; 671 infants; very low-certainty evidence). However, myo-inositol may be associated with a reduction in the incidence of preterm birth (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.70; 4 studies; 829 infants). There were insufficient data for a number of maternal and neonatal secondary outcomes, and no data were reported for any of the long-term childhood or adulthood outcomes, or for health service utilisation outcomes. Evidence from seven studies shows that antenatal dietary supplementation with myo-inositol during pregnancy may reduce the incidence of gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and preterm birth. Limited data suggest that supplementation with myo-inositol may not reduce the risk of a large-for-gestational-age infant.  The current evidence is based on small studies that were not powered to detect differences in outcomes such as perinatal mortality and serious infant morbidity. Six of the included studies were conducted in Italy and one in Ireland, which raises concerns about the lack of generalisability to other settings. There is evidence of inconsistency among doses of myo-inositol, the timing of administration and study population. As a result, we downgraded the certainty of the evidence for many outcomes to low or very low certainty. Further studies for this promising antenatal intervention for preventing gestational diabetes are encouraged and should include pregnant women of different ethnicities and varying risk factors. Myo-inositol at different doses, frequency and timing of administration, should be compared with placebo, diet and exercise, and pharmacological interventions. Long-term follow-up should be considered and outcomes should include potential harms, including adverse effects.",Motuhifonua SK; Lin L; Alsweiler J; Crawford TJ; Crowther CA,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36790138/,1,0,0,1,0,1
36775788,Carotenoids and Their Health Benefits as Derived via Their Interactions with Gut Microbiota.,"Carotenoids have been related to a number of health benefits. Their dietary intake and circulating levels have been associated with a reduced incidence of obesity, diabetes, certain types of cancer, and even lower total mortality. Their potential interaction with the gut microbiota (GM) has been generally overlooked but may be of relevance, as carotenoids largely bypass absorption in the small intestine and are passed on to the colon, where they appear to be in part degraded into unknown metabolites. These may include apo-carotenoids that may have biological effects because of higher aqueous solubility and higher electrophilicity that could better target transcription factors, i.e., NF-κB, PPARγ, and RAR/RXRs. If absorbed in the colon, they could have both local and systemic effects. Certain microbes that may be supplemented were also reported to produce carotenoids in the colon. Although some bactericidal aspects of carotenoids have been shown in vitro, a few studies have also demonstrated a prebiotic-like effect, resulting in bacterial shifts with health-associated properties. Also, stimulation of IgA could play a role in this respect. Carotenoids may further contribute to mucosal and gut barrier health, such as stabilizing tight junctions. This review highlights potential gut-related health-beneficial effects of carotenoids and emphasizes the current research gaps regarding carotenoid-GM interactions.",Eroglu A; Al'Abri IS; Kopec RE; Crook N; Bohn T,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36775788/,1,0,0,0,0,0

In addition to the typical pelvic pain, endometriosis is related to low life quality and decreased work efficiency; clinical consequences include mood complaints, metabolic impairments, inflammation, immunologic problems, and elevated malignancy risks. Several risk factors are correlated with endometriosis including elevated oxidative and nitrosative stress, long-lasting inflammation, raised immune tolerance, as well as autoimmunity. Melatonin is a natural molecule present throughout both the plant and animal kingdoms. It has numerous functions as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. Due to the anti-proliferative, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-invasive features of melatonin, it performances as a beneficial agent to limit endometriosis; this involves several pathways including antiestrogenic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptosis effects, as well as reducing the growth of E2-induced endometriotic tissue. Moreover, melatonin can favor sleep quality and decrease the unwanted signs in the patients.

36771403,Guidelines for Preventing and Treating Vitamin D Deficiency: A 2023 Update in Poland.,"<b>Introduction:</b> All epidemiological studies suggest that vitamin D deficiency is prevalent among the Polish general population. Since vitamin D deficiency was shown to be among the risk factors for many diseases and for all-cause mortality, concern about this problem led us to update the previous Polish recommendations. <b>Methods:</b> After reviewing the epidemiological evidence, case-control studies and randomized control trials (RCTs), a Polish multidisciplinary group formulated questions on the recommendations for prophylaxis and treatment of vitamin D deficiency both for the general population and for the risk groups of patients. The scientific evidence of pleiotropic effects of vitamin D as well as the results of panelists' voting were reviewed and discussed. Thirty-four authors representing different areas of expertise prepared position statements. The consensus group, representing eight Polish/international medical societies and eight national specialist consultants, prepared the final Polish recommendations. <b>Results:</b> Based on networking discussions, the ranges of total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration indicating vitamin D deficiency [<20 ng/mL (<50 nmol/L)], suboptimal status [20-30 ng/mL (50-75 nmol/L)], and optimal concentration [30-50 ng/mL (75-125 nmol/L)] were confirmed. Practical guidelines for cholecalciferol (vitamin D<sub>3</sub>) as the first choice for prophylaxis and treatment of vitamin D deficiency were developed. Calcifediol dosing as the second choice for preventing and treating vitamin D deficiency was introduced. <b>Conclusions:</b> Improving the vitamin D status of the general population and treatment of risk groups of patients must be again announced as healthcare policy to reduce a risk of spectrum of diseases.

We searched databases including PubMed, Cochrane, the comprehensive biomedical research database (Embase), Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) for literature on glucomannan and type II diabetes. Six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible (<i>n</i> = 440 participants) to be included in our analysis.

36745886,Vitamin D and Risk for Type 2 Diabetes in People With Prediabetes : A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Individual Participant Data From 3 Randomized Clinical Trials.,"The role of vitamin D in people who are at risk for type 2 diabetes remains unclear. To evaluate whether administration of vitamin D decreases risk for diabetes among people with prediabetes. PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov from database inception through 9 December 2022. Eligible trials that were specifically designed and conducted to test the effects of oral vitamin D versus placebo on new-onset diabetes in adults with prediabetes. The primary outcome was time to event for new-onset diabetes. Secondary outcomes were regression to normal glucose regulation and adverse events. Prespecified analyses (both unadjusted and adjusted for key baseline variables) were conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle. Three randomized trials were included, which tested cholecalciferol, 20 000 IU (500 mcg) weekly; cholecalciferol, 4000 IU (100 mcg) daily; or eldecalcitol, 0.75 mcg daily, versus matching placebos. Trials were at low risk of bias. Vitamin D reduced risk for diabetes by 15% (hazard ratio, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75 to 0.96]) in adjusted analyses, with a 3-year absolute risk reduction of 3.3% (CI, 0.6% to 6.0%). The effect of vitamin D did not differ in prespecified subgroups. Among participants assigned to the vitamin D group who maintained an intratrial mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of at least 125 nmol/L (≥50 ng/mL) compared with 50 to 74 nmol/L (20 to 29 ng/mL) during follow-up, cholecalciferol reduced risk for diabetes by 76% (hazard ratio, 0.24 [CI, 0.16 to 0.36]), with a 3-year absolute risk reduction of 18.1% (CI, 11.7% to 24.6%). Vitamin D increased the likelihood of regression to normal glucose regulation by 30% (rate ratio, 1.30 [CI, 1.16 to 1.46]).

36720711,Curcumin-piperine co-supplementation and human health: A comprehensive review of preclinical and clinical studies.,"Curcumin is extracted from the rhizomes Curcuma longa L. It is known for its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities. Despite its safety and potential for use against various diseases, curcumin's utility is restricted due to its low oral bioavailability. Co-administration of curcumin along with piperine could potentially improve the bioavailability of curcumin. The present review aimed to provide an overview of the efficacy and safety of curcumin-piperine co-supplementation in human health. The findings of this comprehensive review show the beneficial effects of curcumin-piperine in improving glycemic indices, lipid profile and antioxidant status in diabetes, improving the inflammatory status caused by obesity and metabolic syndrome, reducing oxidative stress and depression in chronic stress and neurological disorders, also improving chronic respiratory diseases, asthma and COVID-19. Further high-quality clinical trial studies are needed to firmly establish the clinical efficacy of the curcumin-piperine supplement.",Heidari H; Bagherniya M; Majeed M; Sathyapalan T; Jamialahmadi T; Sahebkar A,Phytotherapy research : PTR,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36720711/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36713951,Vitamin D Supplementation for the Outcomes of Patients with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus and Neonates: A Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review.,"Prevention and timely treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are important to the prognosis of pregnant women and neonates. We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects and safety of vitamin D supplementation on GDM patients and neonates, to provide insights into clinical GDM treatment. Two authors searched the Medline, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, CNKI, and Wanfang databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects and safety of vitamin D supplementation in GDM patients. The quality of the included RCTs was evaluated according to Cochrane handbook. RevMan 5.3 software was used for statistical analysis. A total of 20 RCTs involving 1682 GDM patients were finally included, of whom 837 received vitamin D supplementation. Vitamin D supplementation in GDM patients increased the serum 25(OH)D level (SMD = 4.07, 95% CI: (2.73, 5.41)) and HDL level (SMD = 0.41, 95% CI: (0.23, 0.58)) and reduced serum LDL (SMD = -0.49, 95% CI: (-0.68, -0.29)), TG (SMD = -0.59, 95% CI: (-1.01, -0.17)), and TC (SMD = -0.67, 95% CI: (-1.19, -0.14)) levels in GDM patients (all <i>P</i> < 0.05). Besides, vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of premature birth (OR = 0.37, 95% CI: (0.22, 0.62)), hyperbilirubinemia (OR = 0.38, 95% CI: (0.25, 0.58)), and neonatal hospitalization (OR = 0.38, 95% CI: (0.25, 0.58)) of neonates (all <i>P</i> < 0.05). No significant publication bias in synthesized results was found (all <i>P</i> > 0.05). Vitamin D supplementation improves the blood lipid level in GDM patients and reduces adverse neonatal outcomes.

36709082,Obesity and dysregulated innate immune responses: impact of micronutrient deficiencies.,"Obesity is associated with the development of various complications, including diabetes, atherosclerosis, and an increased risk for infections, driven by dysfunctional innate immune responses. Recent insights have revealed that the availability of nutrients is a key determinant of innate immune cell function. Although the presence of obesity is associated with overnutrition of macronutrients, several micronutrient deficiencies, including Vitamin D and zinc, are often present. Micronutrients have been attributed important immunomodulatory roles. In this review, we summarize current knowledge of the immunomodulatory effects of Vitamin D and zinc. We also suggest future lines of research to further improve our understanding of these micronutrients; this may serve as a stepping-stone to explore micronutrient supplementation to improve innate immune cell function during obesity.",Vrieling F; Stienstra R,Trends in immunology,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36709082/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36688198,Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation on Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D and Homeostatic Model of Insulin Resistance Levels in Healthy Pregnancy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Progressive insulin resistance is a physiological condition during pregnancy that can lead to gestational diabetes. Given the association between low blood vitamin D levels and insulin resistance, the present meta-analysis evaluated the effect of vitamin D supplementation on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) and the homeostatic model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) levels in non-diabetic pregnant women. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using electronic databases and gateways such as Cochrane Library, Medline, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Web of Sciences, Embase, and Scopus. Articles up to 2020 in both English and Persian were included in the study. The effect of vitamin D supplementation on 25(OH)D and HOMA-IR was determined based on the differences in mean changes from baseline to post-intervention. Weighted mean and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using a random-effects model. Data were analyzed using STATA software. Four studies, including six trials with 380 participants, reported that vitamin D supplementation increased 25(OH)D (mean change: 13.72, 95% CI: 7.28-20.17) and decreased HOMA-IR (mean change: 1.46, 95% CI: 0.56-2.37) levels compared with the placebo group. A high weekly dose of vitamin D further reduced HOMA-IR levels (adjusted R<sup>2</sup>=77.99, I<sup>2</sup> residuals=80.49%, P=0.047). There was no significant association between the dose of vitamin D and 25(OH)D (P=0.974). Intervention duration was not associated with an increase in 25(OH)D (P=0.102), nor with a decrease in HOMA-IR (P=0.623). Vitamin D supplementation increased 25(OH)D and decreased HOMA-IR levels in non-diabetic pregnant women. Vitamin D in high doses further reduced HOMA-IR, but did not affect 25(OH)D concentrations.",Sharafi SM; Yazdi M; Goodarzi-Khoigani M; Kelishadi R,Iranian journal of medical sciences,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36688198/,0,1,0,1,0,0
36678282,Nutraceuticals as Potential Therapeutic Modulators in Immunometabolism.,"Nutraceuticals act as cellular and functional modulators, contributing to the homeostasis of physiological processes. In an inflammatory microenvironment, these functional foods can interact with the immune system by modulating or balancing the exacerbated proinflammatory response. In this process, immune cells, such as antigen-presenting cells (APCs), identify danger signals and, after interacting with T lymphocytes, induce a specific effector response. Moreover, this conditions their change of state with phenotypical and functional modifications from the resting state to the activated and effector state, supposing an increase in their energy requirements that affect their intracellular metabolism, with each immune cell showing a unique metabolic signature. Thus, nutraceuticals, such as polyphenols, vitamins, fatty acids, and sulforaphane, represent an active option to use therapeutically for health or the prevention of different pathologies, including obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. To regulate the inflammation associated with these pathologies, intervention in metabolic pathways through the modulation of metabolic energy with nutraceuticals is an attractive strategy that allows inducing important changes in cellular properties. Thus, we provide an overview of the link between metabolism, immune function, and nutraceuticals in chronic inflammatory processes associated with obesity and diabetes, paying particular attention to nutritional effects on APC and T cell immunometabolism, as well as the mechanisms required in the change in energetic pathways involved after their activation.",Alba G; Dakhaoui H; Santa-Maria C; Palomares F; Cejudo-Guillen M; Geniz I; Sobrino F; Montserrat-de la Paz S; Lopez-Enriquez S,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36678282/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36678185,Can Bioactive Food Substances Contribute to Cystic Fibrosis-Related Cardiovascular Disease Prevention?,"Advances in cystic fibrosis (CF) care have significantly improved the quality of life and life expectancy of patients. Nutritional therapy based on a high-calorie, high-fat diet, antibiotics, as well as new therapies focused on CFTR modulators change the natural course of the disease. They do so by improving pulmonary function and growing BMI. However, the increased weight of such patients can lead to unwanted long-term cardiovascular effects. People with CF (pwCF) experience several cardiovascular risk factors. Such factors include a high-fat diet and increased dietary intake, altered lipid metabolism, a decrease in the level of fat-soluble antioxidants, heightened systemic inflammation, therapeutic interventions, and diabetes mellitus. PwCF must pay special attention to food and eating habits in order to maintain a nutritional status that is as close as possible to the proper physiological one. They also have to benefit from appropriate nutritional counseling, which is essential in the evolution and prognosis of the disease. Growing evidence collected in the last years shows that many bioactive food components, such as phytochemicals, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and antioxidants have favorable effects in the management of CF. An important positive effect is cardiovascular prevention. The possibility of preventing/reducing cardiovascular risk in CF patients enhances both quality of life and life expectancy in the long run.",Trandafir LM; Frăsinariu OE; Țarcă E; Butnariu LI; Leon Constantin MM; Moscalu M; Temneanu OR; Melinte Popescu AS; Popescu MGM; Stârcea IM; Cojocaru E; Moisa SM,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36678185/,1,0,0,0,0,0

36647067,What is the impact of vitamin D supplementation on glycemic control in people with type-2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trails.,"There is conflicting evidence on the effect of vitamin D on glycemic control. Therefore, in the current meta-analyses, we aimed to assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the glycemic control of type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. We conducted a comprehensive search in electronic databases including; PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and NIH's Clinical Trials Registry, from the inception of each database up to January first, 2021. A total of 46 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) consisting of 2164 intervention subjects and 2149 placebo controls were included in this meta-analysis. Pooled analyses for HbA1c showed a significant change between the intervention and placebo group, the weighted mean difference (WMD)(95% confidence interval(CI)) was -0.20%(-0.29, -0.11) with P < 0.001. Analyses for assessing changes in FPG found a significant reduction in the intervention group after vitamin D supplementation, the WMD (95%CI) was -5.02 mg/dl (-6.75,-3.28) with P < 0.001. The result of pooled analyses for HOMA-IR revealed a significant change between the intervention and control group, the WMD (95%CI) was -0.42(-0.76, -0.07) with P = 0.019. The subgroup analyses showed the most efficacy in a higher dose and short intervention period and in subjects with deficient vitamin D status. Vitamin D supplementation might be beneficial for the reduction of FPG, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR in type 2 diabetes patients with deficient vitamin D status. This effect was especially prominent when vitamin D was given in large doses and for a short period of time albeit with substantial heterogeneity between studies and a probability of publication bias.",Farahmand MA; Daneshzad E; Fung TT; Zahidi F; Muhammadi M; Bellissimo N; Azadbakht L,BMC endocrine disorders,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36647067/,0,1,0,1,0,0
36640581,Flaxseed supplementation significantly reduces hemoglobin A1c in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Flaxseed is a functional food because of its high content of alpha-linolenic acid, lignans, and dietary fiber. We hypothesized that flaxseed supplementation would improve cardiometabolic parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); however, clinical trials have shown conflicting results. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine the impact of flaxseed supplementation in patients with T2DM. Randomized controlled trials were systematically searched in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Embase until 25 March 2022. A total of 13 studies were included, and the results showed that flaxseed supplementation significantly reduced hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in participants with T2DM compared with the control group. In contrast, it had no effects on body weight, body mass index, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose (FBG), homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance, quantitative insulin sensitivity check index, and lipid parameters. In the subgroup analyses, FBG was significantly reduced with supplementation of flaxseed in participants with baseline FBG ≥8.0 mmol/L or baseline HbA1c ≥7.0%. And a significant decrease in HbA1c in participants with baseline HbA1c ≥7.0% after flaxseed supplementation. In addition, subgroup analyses indicated that whole flaxseed supplementation significantly increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and reduced total cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in participants with T2DM. In conclusion, flaxseed supplementation significantly reduced HbA1c in participants with T2DM, especially those with poorly controlled blood sugar levels. However, larger scale studies with better designs are needed to confirm insignificant and/or ambiguous findings.",Xi H; Zhou W; Sohaib M; Niu Y; Zhu R; Guo Y; Wang S; Mao J; Wang X; Guo L,"Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36640581/,0,1,0,1,0,0

The comparative effects of micronutrient supplements, however, have not yet been well established. We aimed at evaluating the comparative effects of vitamin and mineral supplements on managing glycemic control and lipid metabolism for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to inform clinical practice. Electronic and hand searches for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were performed until June 1, 2022. We selected RCTs enrolling patients with T2DM who were treated with vitamin supplements, mineral supplements, or placebo/no treatment. Data were pooled via frequentist random-effects network meta-analyses. A total of 170 eligible trials and 14223 participants were included. Low to very low certainty evidence established chromium supplements as the most effective in reducing fasting blood glucose levels and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (SUCRAs: 90.4% and 78.3%, respectively). Vitamin K supplements ranked best in reducing glycated hemoglobin A1c and fasting insulin levels (SUCRAs: 97.0% and 82.3%, respectively), with moderate to very low certainty evidence. Vanadium supplements ranked best in lowering total cholesterol levels with very low evidence certainty (SUCRAs:100%). Niacin supplements ranked best in triglyceride reductions and increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels with low to very low evidence certainty (SUCRAs:93.7% and 94.6%, respectively). Vitamin E supplements ranked best in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels with very low evidence certainty (SUCRAs:80.0%).

36624950,Depletion and Supplementation of Coenzyme Q10 in Secondary Deficiency Disorders.,"Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) deficiency is broadly divided into two types, primary and secondary. Primary CoQ10 deficiencies are relatively rare disorders resulting from mutations in genes directly involved in the CoQ10 biosynthetic pathway, and are not a subject of this article. Secondary CoQ10 disorders are relatively common, and may occur for a variety of reasons; these include mutations in genes not directly related to the synthetic pathway, oxidative stress induced reduction of CoQ10, and the effects of pharmacological agents such as statins. CoQ10 is of key importance in cell metabolism; in addition to its role in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, it is a major endogenous antioxidant, and has a role in the metabolism of sulphides, lipids and amino acids. Given its importance in cell metabolism, it is unsurprising that secondary CoQ10 deficiency has been linked with a wide range of disorders. In this article, we have reviewed evidence of secondary CoQ10 deficiency in both common and less common disorders, and highlighted those disorders in which CoQ10 supplementation has been shown to be of significant clinical benefit.",Mantle D; Turton N; Hargreaves IP,Frontiers in bioscience (Landmark edition),2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36624950/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We suggest that the C24:0 sulfatide isoform may influence the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D). C24:0 sulfatide is a sphingolipid with a long carbon-atom chain. A C16:0 sulfatide isoform is also present in the insulin-producing beta cells of the islets of Langerhans. The C16:0 isoform exhibits chaperone activity and plays an important role in insulin production. In contrast, the C24:0 isoform may suppress the autoimmune attacks on beta cells that lead to T1D.

The aim of this paper was to investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on symptoms of depression in type 2 diabetic patients. The protocol for this review has been registered in PROSPERO:CRD42021231713. Searching for literature was conducted using Pubmed, EBSCOhost, and EMBASE. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) regarding vitamin D supplementation in type 2 diabetic patients with depression were retrieved through a systematic search. The outcome measured was a change in depressive symptoms evaluated with any validated rating scale. Independent data extraction was conducted, and the study quality was assessed. A meta-analysis was carried out to calculate the improvement in depressive symptoms in the group receiving vitamin D and the control group. The available evidence in RCTs was analysed using the PRISMA approach, and clinical significance was determined using the GRADE system. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Four RCTs were reviewed and three RCTs were meta-analysed. In two studies, vitamin D was statistically effective in improving depressive symptoms in type 2 diabetic patients. Three randomised controlled trials  were included in the meta-analysis with 161 subjects using depression score as an outcome assessment. Vitamin D is significantly more effective than placebo (95% CI: -0.70 to - 0.08, p = 0.01). Vitamin D supplementation is effective in improving depressive symptoms in type 2 diabetic patients.

36599781,Effects of probiotics supplementation on blood pressure: An umbrella meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Several meta-analyses have revealed that probiotics could lower blood pressure (BP), but the findings were inconsistent. In this regard, an umbrella meta-analysis was carried out to provide a more accurate estimate of the overall impacts of probiotics supplementation on BP. We searched the following international databases till November 2021: PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. A random-effects model was applied to evaluate the effects of probiotics on BP. Sensitivity analysis was performed by using the leave-one-out method. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to evaluate the certainty of evidence. Pooled effect size of 14 meta-analyses with 15,494 participants indicated significant decreases in both systolic (Weighted mean difference (WMD) = -1.96 mmHg; 95% confidence interval (CI): -2.78, -1.14, p < 0.001, and standardized mean difference (SMD) = -2.62; 95% CI: -4.96, -0.28, p < 0.001) and diastolic BP (WMD = -1.28 mmHg; 95% CI: -1.76, -0.79, p < 0.001, and SMD = -0.60 mmHg; 95% CI: -1.08, -0.12, p = 0.014) following probiotics supplementation. Greater effects on SBP were revealed in trials with a mean age of >50 years and the duration of intervention ≤10 weeks. DBP was also more reduced in studies with a dosage of ≥10<sup>10</sup> colony forming unit (CFU), and SBP was decreased in patients with hypertension or diabetes analyzing WMD. The present umbrella meta-analysis suggests probiotics supplementation to improve BP and claims that probiotics could be used as a complementary therapy for controlling high BP.

36578019,Effects of vitamin D supplementation in endometriosis: a systematic review.,"There is a growing body of human, animal and in vitro studies on vitamin D (vit D) substitution in endometriosis. The aim of this systematic review is to critically appraise and qualitatively synthesize the results of the available studies that examine the supplementation of vit D for endometriosis treatment. A systematic search of the literature was conducted in four electronic databases (Medline, Cochrane, Scopus, Embase) and grey literature for original research articles on humans, animals and in vitro models published in any language. Four human studies, four animal studies and four in vitro studies were included. Quantitative synthesis of human studies showed no significant effect of vit D intake for dysmenorrhea (2 studies, 44 vit D vs 44 placebo, mean -0.71, 95% CI -1.94, 0.51) and non-cyclic pelvic pain (2 studies, 42 vit D vs 38 placebo, mean 0.34, 95% CI -0.02, 0.71). Regarding reproductive outcomes in women with endometriosis after in vitro fertilization, the only available study showed no differences between women taking vit D and women taking placebo. Three of the four included animal studies showed regression of endometriotic implants when treated with vit D. The in vitro studies demonstrated that vit D decreases invasion and proliferation of endometriotic lesions without affecting apoptosis. Although in vitro and animal studies suggest regression of the endometriotic implants and decrease of invasion and proliferation after vit D supplementation, this was not reflected in the results of the meta-analysis, which showed no benefit of vit D supplementation in patients with endometriosis and dysmenorrhea or non-cyclic pelvic pain as well as on the outcome of IVF treatment. However, given the heterogeneity and the diversity of the available studies, more research is required to shed light on the role of vit D supplementation in women with endometriosis.",Kalaitzopoulos DR; Samartzis N; Daniilidis A; Leeners B; Makieva S; Nirgianakis K; Dedes I; Metzler JM; Imesch P; Lempesis IG,Reproductive biology and endocrinology : RB&E,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36578019/,0,1,0,1,0,0
36566517,EMAS position statement: Vitamin D and menopausal health.,"There is increasing evidence that vitamin D has widespread tissue effects. In addition to osteoporosis, vitamin D deficiency has been associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, infections and neurodegenerative disease. However, the effect of vitamin D supplementation on non-skeletal outcomes requires clarification, especially in postmenopausal women. This position statement provides an evidence-based overview of the role of vitamin D in the health of postmenopausal women based on observational and interventional studies. Literature review and consensus of expert opinion. Vitamin D status is determined by measuring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Concentrations <20 ng/ml (<50 nmol/l) and <10 ng/ml (<25 nmol/l) are considered to constitute vitamin D deficiency and severe deficiency, respectively. Observational data suggest an association between vitamin D deficiency and adverse health outcomes in postmenopausal women, although they cannot establish causality. The evidence from randomized controlled trials concerning vitamin D supplementation is not robust, since many studies did not consider whether people were deficient at baseline. Moreover, high heterogeneity exists in terms of the population studied, vitamin D dosage, calcium co-administration and duration of intervention. Concerning skeletal health, vitamin D deficiency is associated with low bone mass and an increased risk of fractures. Vitamin D supplementation at maintenance doses of 800-2000 IU/day (20-50 μg/day), after repletion of vitamin D status with higher weekly or daily doses, may be of benefit only when co-administered with calcium (1000-1200 mg/day), especially in the elderly populations and those with severe vitamin D deficiency. Concerning cardiovascular disease, vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, mainly metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia. Vitamin D deficiency, especially its severe form, is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events (coronary heart disease, stroke, mortality), independently of traditional risk factors. Vitamin D supplementation may have a modestly beneficial effect on lipid profile and glucose homeostasis, especially in obese individuals or those ≥60 years old and at doses of ≥2000 IU/day (≥50 μg/day). However, it has no effect on the incidence of cardiovascular events. Concerning cancer, vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased incidence of and mortality from several types of cancer, such as colorectal, lung and breast cancer. However, the data on other types of gynecological cancer are inconsistent. Vitamin D supplementation has no effect on cancer incidence, although a modest reduction in cancer-related mortality has been observed. Concerning infections, vitamin D deficiency has been associated with acute respiratory tract infections, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Vitamin D supplementation may decrease the risk of acute respiratory tract infections and the severity of COVID-19 (not the risk of infection). Concerning menopausal symptomatology, vitamin D deficiency may have a negative impact on some aspects, such as sleep disturbances, depression, sexual function and joint pains. However, vitamin D supplementation has no effect on these, except for vulvovaginal atrophy, at relatively high doses, i.e., 40,000-60,000 IU/week (1000-1500 IU/week) orally or 1000 IU/day (25 μg/day) as a vaginal suppository.",Anagnostis P; Livadas S; Goulis DG; Bretz S; Ceausu I; Durmusoglu F; Erkkola R; Fistonic I; Gambacciani M; Geukes M; Hamoda H; Hartley C; Hirschberg AL; Meczekalski B; Mendoza N; Mueck A; Smetnik A; Stute P; van Trotsenburg M; Rees M; Lambrinoudaki I,Maturitas,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36566517/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36558404,The Role of Dietary Polyphenols in Pregnancy and Pregnancy-Related Disorders.,"Polyphenols are a group of phytochemicals with extensive biological functions and health-promoting potential. These compounds are present in most foods of plant origin and their increased widespread availability through the intake of nutritional supplements, fortified foods, and beverages, has also led to increased exposure throughout gestation. In this narrative review, we focus on the role of polyphenols in both healthy and pathological pregnancy. General information related to their classification and function is followed by an overview of their known effects in early-pregnancy events, including the current insights into molecular mechanisms involved. Further, we provide an overview of their involvement in some of the most common pregnancy-associated pathological conditions, such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes mellitus. Additionally, we also discuss the estimated possible risk of polyphenol consumption on pregnancy outcomes. The consumption of dietary polyphenols during pregnancy needs particular attention considering the possible effects of polyphenols on the mechanisms involved in maternal adaptation and fetal development. Further studies are strongly needed to unravel the in vivo effects of polyphenol metabolites during pregnancy, as well as their role on advanced maternal age, prenatal nutrition, and metabolic risk of the offspring.",Nacka-Aleksić M; Pirković A; Vilotić A; Bojić-Trbojević Ž; Jovanović Krivokuća M; Giampieri F; Battino M; Dekanski D,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36558404/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36557912,Recent Advances in Natural Polyphenol Research.,"Polyphenols are secondary metabolites produced by plants, which contribute to the plant's defense against abiotic stress conditions (e.g., UV radiation and precipitation), the aggression of herbivores, and plant pathogens. Epidemiological studies suggest that long-term consumption of plant polyphenols protects against cardiovascular disease, cancer, osteoporosis, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases. Their structural diversity has fascinated and confronted analytical chemists on how to carry out unambiguous identification, exhaustive recovery from plants and organic waste, and define their nutritional and biological potential. The food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries employ polyphenols from fruits and vegetables to produce additives, additional foods, and supplements. In some cases, nanocarriers have been used to protect polyphenols during food processing, to solve the issues related to low water solubility, to transport them to the site of action, and improve their bioavailability. This review summarizes the structure-bioactivity relationships, processing parameters that impact polyphenol stability and bioavailability, the research progress in nanocarrier delivery, and the most innovative methodologies for the exhaustive recovery of polyphenols from plant and agri-waste materials.",Dini I; Grumetto L,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36557912/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36552762,Nutraceuticals in Brown Adipose Tissue Activation.,"Obesity and its associated comorbidities have become pandemic, and challenge the global healthcare system. Lifestyle changes, nutritional interventions and phamaceuticals should be differently combined in a personalized strategy to tackle such a public health burden. Altered brown adipose tissue (BAT) function contributes to the pathophysiology of obesity and glucose metabolism dysfunctions. BAT thermogenic activity burns glucose and fatty acids to produce heat through uncoupled respiration, and can dissipate the excessive calorie intake, reduce glycemia and circulate fatty acids released from white adipose tissue. Thus, BAT activity is expected to contribute to whole body energy homeostasis and protect against obesity, diabetes and alterations in lipid profile. To date, pharmacological therapies aimed at activating brown fat have failed in clinical trials, due to cardiovascular side effects or scarce efficacy. On the other hand, several studies have identified plant-derived chemical compounds capable of stimulating BAT thermogenesis in animal models, suggesting the translational applications of dietary supplements to fight adipose tissue dysfunctions. This review describes several nutraceuticals with thermogenic properties and provides indications, at a molecular level, of the regulation of the adipocyte thermogenesis by the mentioned phytochemicals.",Armani A; Feraco A; Camajani E; Gorini S; Lombardo M; Caprio M,Cells,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36552762/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36543706,"Effects of whey protein supplementation on adiposity, body weight, and glycemic parameters: A synthesis of evidence.","The aim of this review was to analyze the evidence of whey protein supplementation on body weight, fat mass, lean mass and glycemic parameters in subjects with overweight or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) undergoing calorie restriction or with ad libitum intake. Overweight and obesity are considered risk factors for the development of chronic noncommunicable diseases such as T2DM. Calorie restriction is a dietary therapy that reduces weight and fat mass, promotes the improvement of glycemic parameters, and decreases muscle mass. The maintenance of muscle mass during weight loss is necessary in view of its implication in preventing chronic diseases and improving functional capacity and quality of life. The effects of increased protein consumption on attenuating muscle loss and reducing body fat during calorie restriction or ad libitum intake in overweight individuals are discussed. Some studies have demonstrated the positive effects of whey protein supplementation on improving satiety and postprandial glycemic control in short term; however, it remains unclear whether long-term whey protein supplementation can positively affect glycemic parameters. Although whey protein is considered to have a high nutritional quality, its effects in the treatment of overweight, obese individuals and those with T2DM undergoing calorie restriction or ad libitum intake are still inconclusive.",Giglio BM; Lobo PCB; Pimentel GD,"Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36543706/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36533967,Exogenous ketone supplementation: an emerging tool for physiologists with potential as a metabolic therapy.,"What is the topic of this review? The integrative physiological response to exogenous ketone supplementation. What advances does it highlight? The physiological effects and therapeutic potential of exogenous ketones on metabolic health, cardiovascular function, cognitive processing, and modulation of inflammatory pathways and immune function. Also highlighted are current challenges and future directions of the field. Exogenous oral ketone supplements, primarily in form of ketone salts or esters, have emerged as a useful research tool for manipulating metabolism with potential therapeutic application targeting various aspects of several common chronic diseases. Recent literature has investigated the effects of exogenously induced ketosis on metabolic health, cardiovascular function, cognitive processing, and modulation of inflammatory pathways and immune function. This narrative review provides an overview of the integrative physiological effects of exogenous ketone supplementation and highlights current challenges and future research directions. Much of the existing research on therapeutic applications - particularly mechanistic studies - has involved pre-clinical rodent and/or cellular models, requiring further validation in human clinical studies. Existing human studies report that exogenous ketones can lower blood glucose and improve some aspects of cognitive function, highlighting the potential therapeutic application of exogenous ketones for type 2 diabetes and neurological diseases. There is also support for the ability of exogenous ketosis to improve cardiac metabolism in rodent models of heart failure with supporting human studies emerging; long-terms effects of exogenous ketone supplementation on the human cardiovascular system and lipid profiles are needed. An important avenue for future work is provided by research accelerating technologies that enable continuous ketone monitoring and/or the development of more palatable ketone mixtures that optimize plasma ketone kinetics to enable sustained ketosis. Lastly, research exploring the physiological interactions between exogenous ketones and varying metabolic states (e.g., exercise, fasting, metabolic disease) should yield important insights that can be used to maximize the health benefits of exogenous ketosis.",Falkenhain K; Islam H; Little JP,Experimental physiology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36533967/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36526243,Vitamin C supplementation for diabetes management: A comprehensive narrative review.,"Growing evidence suggests that vitamin C supplementation may be an effective adjunct therapy in the management of people with diabetes. This paper critically reviews the current evidence on effects of vitamin C supplementation and its potential mechanisms in diabetes management. Evidence from meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) show favourable effects of vitamin C on glycaemic control and blood pressure that may be clinically meaningful, and mixed effects on blood lipids and endothelial function. However, evidence is mostly of low evidence certainty. Emerging evidence is promising for effects of vitamin C supplementation on some diabetes complications, particularly diabetic foot ulcers. However, there is a notable lack of robust and well-designed studies exploring effects of vitamin C as a single compound supplement on diabetes prevention and patient-important outcomes (i.e. prevention and amelioration of diabetes complications). RCTs are also required to investigate potential preventative or ameliorative effects of vitamin C on gestational diabetes outcomes. Oral vitamin C doses of 500-1000 mg per day are potentially effective, safe, and affordable for many individuals with diabetes. However, personalisation of supplementation regimens that consider factors such as vitamin C status, disease status, current glycaemic control, vitamin C intake, redox status, and genotype is important to optimize vitamin C's therapeutic effects safely. Finally, given a high prevalence of vitamin C deficiency in patients with complications, it is recommended that plasma vitamin C concentration be measured and monitored in the clinic setting.",Mason SA; Parker L; van der Pligt P; Wadley GD,Free radical biology & medicine,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36526243/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36524621,Natural and low-caloric rebaudioside A as a substitute for dietary sugars: A comprehensive review.,"For health and safety concerns, traditional high-calorie sweeteners and artificial sweeteners are gradually replaced in food industries by natural and low-calorie sweeteners. As a natural and high-quality sugar substitute, steviol glycosides (SvGls) are continually scrutinized regarding their safety and application. Recently, the cultivation of organic stevia has been increasing in many parts of Europe and Asia, and it is obvious that there is a vast market for sugar substitutes in the future. Rebaudioside A, the main component of SvGls, is gradually accepted by consumers due to its safe, zero calories, clear, and sweet taste with no significant undesirable characteristics. Hence, it can be used in various foods or dietary supplements as a sweetener. In addition, rebaudioside A has been demonstrated to have many physiological functions, such as antihypertension, anti-diabetes, and anticaries. But so far, there are few comprehensive reviews of rebaudioside A. In this review article, we discuss the physicochemical properties, metabolic process, safety, regulatory, health benefits, and biosynthetic pathway of rebaudioside A and summarize the modification methods and state-of-the-art production and purification techniques of rebaudioside A. Furthermore, the current problems hindering the future production and application of rebaudioside A are analyzed, and suggestions are provided.",Wang Y; Luo X; Chen L; Mustapha AT; Yu X; Zhou C; Okonkwo CE,Comprehensive reviews in food science and food safety,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36524621/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36484095,An evidence review and nutritional conceptual framework for pre-eclampsia prevention.,"Pre-eclampsia is a serious complication of pregnancy, and maternal nutritional factors may play protective roles or exacerbate risk. The tendency to focus on single nutrients as a risk factor obscures the complexity of possible interactions, which may be important given the complex nature of pre-eclampsia. An evidence review was conducted to compile definite, probable, possible and indirect nutritional determinants of pre-eclampsia to map a nutritional conceptual framework for pre-eclampsia prevention. Determinants of pre-eclampsia were first compiled through an initial consultation with experts. Second, an expanded literature review was conducted to confirm associations, elicit additional indicators and evaluate evidence. The strength of association was evaluated as definite relative risk (RR) < 0·40 or ≥3·00, probable RR 0·40-0·69 or 1·50-2·99, possible RR 0·70-0·89 or 1·10-1·49 or not discernible RR 0·90-1·09. The quality of evidence was evaluated using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation. Twenty-five nutritional factors were reported in two umbrella reviews and twenty-two meta-analyses. Of these, fourteen were significantly associated with pre-eclampsia incidence. Higher serum Fe emerged as a definite nutritional risk factors for pre-eclampsia incidence across populations, while low serum Zn was a risk factor in Asia and Africa. Maternal vitamin D deficiency was a probable risk factor and Ca and/or vitamin D supplementation were probable protective nutritional factors. Healthy maternal dietary patterns were possibly associated with lower risk of developing pre-eclampsia. Potential indirect pathways of maternal nutritional factors and pre-eclampsia may exist through obesity, maternal anaemia and gestational diabetes mellitus. Research gaps remain on the influence of household capacities and socio-cultural, economic and political contexts, as well as interactions with medical conditions.",Kinshella MW; Pickerill K; Bone JN; Prasad S; Campbell O; Vidler M; Craik R; Volvert ML; Mistry HD; Tsigas E; Magee LA; von Dadelszen P; Moore SE; Elango R,The British journal of nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36484095/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36479502,Dietary supplements for lipedema.,"Lipedema is a chronic disease that mostly manifests in females as the abnormal distribution of subcutaneous adipose connective tissue, usually coupled with bruising, pain, and edema. Lipedema molecular pathophysiology is currently not clear, but several studies suggest that genetics and hormonal imbalance participate in lipedema pathogenesis. Women with lipedema present in some cases with elevated body mass index, and the appearance of obesity in addition to lipedema, where the obesity can cause serious health issues as in lipedema-free individuals with obesity, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. Unlike obesity, lipedema tissue does not respond well to diet or physical exercise alone. Therefore, in this review we discuss the effect of various dietary supplements that, along with diet and physical exercise, cause fat burning and weight loss, and which could potentially be important in the treatment of lipedema. Indeed, an effective fat burner should convert stored fats into energy, mobilize and break down triglycerides in adipocytes, boost metabolism and inhibit lipogenesis. Common ingredients of fat burning supplements are green tea, caffeine, chromium, carnitine, and conjugated linoleic acid. The use of fat burners could act synergistically with a healthy diet and physical exercise for decreasing adipose tissue deposition in patients with lipedema and resolve related health issues. The effects of fat burners in human studies are sometimes contradictory, and further studies should test their effectiveness in treating lipedema.",Bonetti G; Herbst KL; Dhuli K; Kiani AK; Michelini S; Michelini S; Ceccarini MR; Michelini S; Ricci M; Cestari M; Codini M; Beccari T; Bellinato F; Gisondi P; Bertelli M,Journal of preventive medicine and hygiene,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36479502/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36479498,Main nutritional deficiencies.,"Nutrition is the source of energy that is required to carry out all the processes of human body. A balanced diet is a combination of both macro- and micronutrients. ""Nutritional inadequacy"" involves an intake of nutrients that is lower than the estimated average requirement, whereas ""nutritional deficiency"" consists of severely reduced levels of one or more nutrients, making the body unable to normally perform its functions and thus leading to an increased risk of several diseases like cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. Malnutrition could be caused by environmental factors, like food scarcity, as well as disease conditions, like anorexia nervosa, fasting, swallowing inability, persistent vomiting, impaired digestion, intestinal malabsorption, or other chronic diseases. Nutritional biomarkers - like serum or plasma levels of nutrients such as folate, vitamin C, B vitamins, vitamin D, selenium, copper, zinc - could be used for the evaluation of nutrient intake and dietary exposure. Macronutrients deficiencies could cause kwashiorkor, marasmus, ketosis, growth retardation, wound healing, and increased infection susceptibility, whereas micronutrient - like iron, folate, zinc, iodine, and vitamin A - deficiencies lead to intellectual impairment, poor growth, perinatal complications, degenerative diseases associated with aging and higher morbidity and mortality. Preventing macro- and micronutrient deficiency is crucial and this could be achieved through supplementation and food-based approaches.",Kiani AK; Dhuli K; Donato K; Aquilanti B; Velluti V; Matera G; Iaconelli A; Connelly ST; Bellinato F; Gisondi P; Bertelli M,Journal of preventive medicine and hygiene,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36479498/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36479472,Dietary supplements for obesity.,"Obesity and associated complications including diabetes, cardiometabolic dysfunction, disability, malignancy and premature mortality are considered epidemic. Research on obesity is therefore of worldwide importance. The development of obesity is a multifactorial phenomenon with contributions from biological, behavioral, genetic and environmental factors. Obesity and its associated issues require various lifestyle modifications and treatment options such medication, exercise, diet, surgery, pharmacological therapy and dietary supplements. Dietary supplements are considered an attractive alternative to traditional therapy due to their low toxicity profile and their accessibility to the general population. Dietary supplements may include one or more dietary ingredients. In this narrative review, we analyze the effects on obesity and obesity-related issues of various natural components. For example, there are a myriad of supplements that have been used as dietary supplements for weight loss such as minerals, vitamins, amino acids, metabolites, herbs, and plant extracts. This narrative review aims to present the benefits and side-effects of several ingredients of dietary supplements for weight loss and treatment of obesity. In particular, the mechanism of action, results of clinical trials, and possible side effects will be presented for the following ingredients: β-Glucans, bitter orange, calcium, vitamin D, chitosan, chromium, cocoa, coleus forskohlii, conjugate linoleic acid, ephedra sinica, fucoxanthin, garcinia cambogia, glucomannan, green coffee, green tea, guar gum, raspberry, hoodia gordonii, irvingia gabonensis, phenylpropylamine, pyruvate, white kidney bean.",Bonetti G; Herbst KL; Donato K; Dhuli K; Kiani AK; Aquilanti B; Velluti V; Matera G; Iaconelli A; Bertelli M,Journal of preventive medicine and hygiene,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36479472/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36474318,The Effects of Protein and Supplements on Sarcopenia in Human Clinical Studies: How Older Adults Should Consume Protein and Supplements.,"Sarcopenia is a condition in which muscle mass, strength, and performance decrease with age. It is associated with chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension, and contributes to an increase in mortality. Because managing sarcopenia is critical for maintaining good health and quality of life for the elderly, the condition has sparked concern among many researchers. To counteract sarcopenia, intake of protein is an important factor, while a lack of either protein or vitamin D is a major cause of sarcopenia. In addition, essential amino acids, leucine, β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate (HMB), creatine, and citrulline are used as supplements for muscle health and are suggested as alternatives for controlling sarcopenia. There are many studies on such proteins and supplements, but it is necessary to actually organize the types, amounts, and methods by which proteins and supplements should be consumed to inhibit sarcopenia. In this study, the efficacy of proteins and supplements for controlling sarcopenia according to human clinical studies is summarized to provide suggestions about how the elderly may consume proteins, amino acids, and other supplements.",Jang YJ,Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36474318/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36466660,Metabolites extracted from microorganisms as potential inhibitors of glycosidases (α-glucosidase and α-amylase): A review.,"α-Glucosidase and α-amylase are the two main glycosidases that participate in the metabolism of carbohydrates. Inhibitors of these two enzymes are considered an important medical treatment for carbohydrate uptake disorders, such as diabetes and obesity. Microbes are an important source of constituents that have the potential to inhibit glycosidases and can be used as sources of new drugs and dietary supplements. For example, the α-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose, isolated from <i>Actinoplanes</i> sp., has played an important role in adequately controlling type 2 diabetes, but this class of marketed drugs has many drawbacks, such as poor compliance with treatment and expense. This demonstrates the need for new microorganism-derived resources, as well as novel classes of drugs with better compliance, socioeconomic benefits, and safety. This review introduces the literature on microbial sources of α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibitors, with a focus on endophytes and marine microorganisms, over the most recent 5 years. This paper also reviews the application of glycosidase inhibitors as drugs and dietary supplements. These studies will contribute to the future development of new microorganism-derived glycosidase inhibitors.",Wang X; Li J; Shang J; Bai J; Wu K; Liu J; Yang Z; Ou H; Shao L,Frontiers in microbiology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36466660/,1,0,0,0,0,0

36432623,Potential Benefits of Selenium Supplementation in Reducing Insulin Resistance in Patients with Cardiometabolic Diseases: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Selenium is a trace element that has been reported to be effective in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. However, there is conflicting evidence from different clinical trials of selenium supplementation in treating cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs). This meta-analysis aimed to identify the effects of selenium supplementation on insulin resistance, glucose homeostasis, and lipid profiles in patients with CMDs. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of selenium supplementation for treating CMDs were screened in five electronic databases. Insulin levels, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and glycosylated hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) were defined as the primary outcome markers, and lipid profiles were considered the secondary outcome markers. Ten studies involving 526 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The results suggested that selenium supplementation significantly reduced serum insulin levels (standardized men difference [SMD]: -0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI] [-0.84, -0.21], <i>p</i> = 0.001, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 68%) and HOMA-IR (SMD: -0.50, 95% CI [-0.86, -0.14], <i>p</i> = 0.006, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 75%) and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (SMD: 0.97; 95% CI [0.26, 1.68], <i>p</i> = 0.007, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 92%), but had no significant effect on FPG, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C). Current evidence supports the beneficial effects of selenium supplementation on reducing insulin levels, HOMA-IR, and increasing HDL-C levels. Selenium supplementation may be an effective strategy for reducing insulin resistance in patients with CMDs. However, more high-quality clinical studies are needed to improve the certainty of our estimates.",Ouyang J; Cai Y; Song Y; Gao Z; Bai R; Wang A,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36432623/,0,1,0,1,0,0
36432476,Iron Supplementation in Pregnancy and Risk of Gestational Diabetes: A Narrative Review.,"Pregnant women frequently supplement their diets with iron to treat any cryptic anemia, on the assumption that if anemia is not present, there will be no negative consequences. However, in women who are already iron-replete, it has been suggested that this can lead to iron overload and an increased risk of certain pregnancy complications. One such complication is gestational diabetes. Fourteen clinical trials, case-control or cohort studies (found using Pubmed/Scopus/Web of Science) have investigated links between iron supplementation in pregnancy and risk of gestational diabetes, several of them finding significant associations with increased risk. Potential mechanisms include increased oxidative stress leading to insulin resistance and inadequate compensatory insulin secretion. Current evidence suggests that dietary supplementation with iron in pregnancy may increase a pregnant woman's chance of developing gestational diabetes, although available evidence is somewhat contradictory, and the magnitude of any increased risk appears relatively small. Meta-analyses have suggested the presence of significant heterogeneity in results between studies, urging a degree of caution in interpreting these results. It is currently suggested that advice to pregnant women about whether to supplement their diets with iron or not should consider both their current iron status and their other established risk factors for gestational diabetes.",Petry CJ,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36432476/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36404841,Therapeutic effects of dietary antioxidative supplements on the management of type 2 diabetes and its complications; umbrella review of observational/trials meta-analysis studies.,"Controversial data on the effects of vitamins (V) and nutrients on the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is available. Thus, it is aimed to clarify the role of vitamins and nutrients through an umbrella review regarding the available observational/ trials meta-analyses. All meta-analyses of observational and clinical trials conducted on the impact of vitamins and nutrients in T2DM published until 5<sup>th</sup> June 2021 in PubMed or Web of Sciences were included in this review. Also, the meta-analysis on children, pregnant women, type 1 DM, or in vivo/in vitro studies was excluded. Search results were reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) flowchart. The overall of 93 papers (99 studies) consisting of 75 trials and 24 observational studies were included. Most studies were conducted on the effect of VD and alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) in both genders. Consumption of VD or its analogous; 20 IU/d to 450,000 IU/once for 3 weeks to 7 years showed to have a positive effect on the parameters of glucose hemostasis. Moreover, an inverse association was observed between VD level and T2DM risk. Daily consumption of 1200 mg VC for at least 12 weeks improved lipid profile and glucose hemostasis parameters. Furthermore, VB and medications for diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) increased nerve conduction velocity. Vitamins K and E were showen to not have significant impact on T2DM. ALA had a beneficial effect on DPN symptoms after 2-4 weeks of intake of at least 300 mg/d. T2DM risk was reduced by doubling ALA intake. The effective daily doses of chromium, zinc and coenzyme Q10 on lipid profile and glucose hemostasis parameters were > 200 mg, < 25 mg, and < 200 mg, respectively. This umbrella review suggests that dietary vitamins and nutrients can result in protective impacts the complications associated with T2DM. However, due to discrepancies between the results of the trials and observational studies is essential to conduct long-term high-qualified studies to prove the beneficial therapeutic effects of the vitamins and nutrients on T2DM and its complications.",Tabatabaei-Malazy O; Peimani M; Mohseni S; Nikfar S; Abdollahi M; Larijani B,Journal of diabetes and metabolic disorders,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36404841/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Screening was performed according to the population, intervention, comparison, outcome and study type. This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and meta-analyses (PRISMA-2020) statement. Eight RCTs involving 551 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Probiotic use in women with gestational diabetes significantly decreased fasting blood glucose (mean difference: -1.43; 95 % CI: -2.78 to -0.09, p: 0.04) and serum insulin (mean difference: -3.66; 95 % CI: -5.04 to -2.27, p < 0.001). Moreover, the use of probiotics and synbiotics significantly reduced the HOMA-IR level compared to the control group (probiotic group: mean difference: -0.74; 95 % CI: -1.05 to -0.44, p < 0.001; synbiotic group: mean difference: -0.68; 95 % CI: -1.26 to -0.09, p: 0.02). The use of probiotics in women with GDM reduced fasting plasma glucose, fasting serum insulin, and HOMA-IR levels. In addition, the use of synbiotics decreased HOMA-IR.

There are no systematic reviews in the literature analysing the effects of supplementation with leucine alone or as part of a supplement, and with or without physical exercise in older people with sarcopenia. We aimed to systematically review the evidence in intervention studies on the effects of supplementation with leucine, either alone, combined with other supplements, or combined with other supplements and physical exercise in older people with sarcopenia. Literature searches related to the topic were conducted in three databases (Pubmed/Medline, Cochrane and SciELO) looking for articles published prior to December 2020. This review includes intervention studies in older adults over 60 years of age with a history of sarcopenia where researchers reported on the effects of leucine supplementation, with or without physical exercise, related to the disease's treatments or outcomes. The systematic review identified three intervention studies examining the effect of leucine without physical exercise, one on leucine with physical exercise, seven on leucine paired with another nutrient and without physical exercise, and twelve on leucine paired with another nutrient and physical exercise. The results revealed that leucine supplementation alone and without physical exercise did not improve markers of sarcopenia, whereas interventions pairing leucine with supplements, particularly leucine-enriched protein supplements, are a promising treatment for the improvement of sarcopenic markers, whether with or without physical exercise. Leucine supplementation, specifically paired with protein supplements, both with and without physical exercise, was found to be an effective dietary intervention for the improvement of sarcopenia. Further dietary interventions are necessary to calculate effective dosage quantities for both leucine and nutrient supplementation as an integral part of the treatment.",Conde Maldonado E; Marqués-Jiménez D; Casas-Agustench P; Bach-Faig A,"Endocrinologia, diabetes y nutricion",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36396594/,0,1,0,0,0,0
36396409,An Evidence-Based Review of Vitamin D for Common and High-Mortality Conditions.,"<b>Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin available from food and sun exposure. Vitamin D receptors are present in cells throughout the body and cause it to act like a hormone. Observational studies document the association of low vitamin D levels with multiple health conditions. This article reviews the evidence for vitamin D in prevention and treatment in primary care.</b> METHODS: <b>We performed a literature review of randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and large prospective trials looking at the role of vitamin D deficiency in the most common conditions seen in primary care and the top 10 causes of mortality since 2010.</b> RESULTS: <b>Vitamin D supplementation in patients with known cardiovascular disease does not reduce risk of stroke or heart attack. Vitamin D supplementation does not seem to have an effect in the treatment of hypertension or in cancer prevention. There is emerging evidence that supplementation reduces COVID-19 severity and risk of mechanical ventilation. Vitamin D at more moderate levels may reduce the risk of falls, but higher doses may cause increased fall risk. There does not seem to be a link between vitamin D supplementation and improved cognition. Vitamin D supplementation may be helpful in patients with major depression. High dose vitamin D may improve pain in people with fibromyalgia. Supplementing patients with prediabetes reduced the risk of progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Vitamin D supplementation in addition to standard emollient treatment helped to reduce symptoms in people with atopic dermatitis.</b> CONCLUSION: <b>Prospective studies of vitamin D supplementation demonstrate variable impact on disease specific and patient-oriented outcomes, suggesting a correlation but not a causal relationship between low vitamin D levels and disease pathogenicity. Future research should determine dosing standards and timing of vitamin D in treatment and prevention.</b>",Michael W; Couture AD; Swedlund M; Hampton A; Eglash A; Schrager S,Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36396409/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36386907,Vitamin C intake potentially lowers total cholesterol to improve endothelial function in diabetic patients at increased risk of cardiovascular disease: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials.,"Vitamin C is one of the most consumed dietary compounds and contains abundant antioxidant properties that could be essential in improving metabolic function. Thus, the current systematic review analyzed evidence on the beneficial effects of vitamin C intake on cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related outcomes in patients with diabetes or metabolic syndrome. To identify relevant randomized control trials (RCTs), a systematic search was run using prominent search engines like PubMed and Google Scholar, from beginning up to March 2022. The modified Black and Downs checklist was used to assess the quality of evidence. Findings summarized in the current review favor the beneficial effects of vitamin C intake on improving basic metabolic parameters and lowering total cholesterol levels to reduce CVD-risk in subjects with type 2 diabetes or related metabolic diseases. Moreover, vitamin C intake could also reduce the predominant markers of inflammation and oxidative stress like C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and malondialdehyde. Importantly, these positive outcomes were consistent with improved endothelial function or increased blood flow in these subjects. Predominantly effective doses were 1,000 mg/daily for 4 weeks up to 12 months. The included RCTs presented with the high quality of evidence. Clinical evidence on the beneficial effects of vitamin C intake or its impact on improving prominent markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in patients with diabetes is still limited. Thus, more RCTs are required to solidify these findings, which is essential to better manage diabetic patients at increased risk of developing CVD.",Dludla PV; Nkambule BB; Nyambuya TM; Ziqubu K; Mabhida SE; Mxinwa V; Mokgalaboni K; Ndevahoma F; Hanser S; Mazibuko-Mbeje SE; Basson AK; Sabbatinelli J; Tiano L,Frontiers in nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36386907/,0,1,0,0,0,0

36364883,Effects of Additional Dietary Fiber Supplements on Pregnant Women with Gestational Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Studies.,"The efficacy of different types and doses of dietary fiber supplementation in the treatment of gestational diabetes (GDM) remains controversial. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of dietary fiber on blood glucose control in pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus, and further observe the effect on their blood lipids and pregnancy outcomes. We searched on Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane, and included several articles on additional fortification with dietary fiber for gestational diabetes interventions. This meta-analysis included 8 trials. We found that additional dietary fiber supplements significantly reduced fasting glucose (Hedges’g = −0.3; 95% CI [−0.49, −0.1]), two-hour postprandial glucose (Hedges’g = −0.69; 95% CI [−0.88, −0.51]), glycated hemoglobin (Hedges’g = −0.5; 95% CI [−0.68, −0.31]), TC (Hedges’g = −0.44; 95% CI [−0.69, −0.19]), TG (Hedges’g = −0.3; 95% CI [−0.4, −0.2]) and LDL-C (Hedges’g = −0.48; 95% CI [−0.63, −0.33]). It also significantly reduced preterm delivery (Hedges’g = 0.4, 95% CI [0.19~0.84]), cesarean delivery (Hedges’g = 0.6; 95% CI [0.37~0.97]), fetal distress (Hedges’g = 0.51; 95% CI [0.22~1.19]), and neonatal weight (Hedges’g = −0.17; 95% CI [−0.27~−0.07]). In a subgroup analysis comparing dietary fiber type and dose, insoluble dietary fiber was more effective than soluble dietary fiber in reducing fasting glucose (Hedges’g = −0.44; 95% CI [−0.52, −0.35]). ≥12 g fiber per day may be more effective in improving glycemic lipid and pregnancy outcomes than <12 g/day, but the difference was not statistically significant. In conclusion, our meta-analysis showed that dietary fiber supplementation significantly improved glycolipid metabolism and pregnancy outcomes in gestational diabetes. Dietary fiber may be considered adjunctive therapy for gestational diabetes, and an additional supplement with insoluble dietary fiber is more recommended for those with poor fasting glucose. However, more high-quality studies are needed on the further effect of fiber type and the dose-effect relationship.",Sun J; Wang J; Ma W; Miao M; Sun G,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36364883/,0,1,0,1,0,0
36364000,Repurposing SGLT2 Inhibitors for Neurological Disorders: A Focus on the Autism Spectrum Disorder.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a substantially increasing incidence rate. It is characterized by repetitive behavior, learning difficulties, deficits in social communication, and interactions. Numerous medications, dietary supplements, and behavioral treatments have been recommended for the management of this condition, however, there is no cure yet. Recent studies have examined the therapeutic potential of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in neurodevelopmental diseases, based on their proved anti-inflammatory effects, such as downregulating the expression of several proteins, including the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and the monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1). Furthermore, numerous previous studies revealed the potential of the SGLT2 inhibitors to provide antioxidant effects, due to their ability to reduce the generation of free radicals and upregulating the antioxidant systems, such as glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), while crossing the blood brain barrier (BBB). These properties have led to significant improvements in the neurologic outcomes of multiple experimental disease models, including cerebral oxidative stress in diabetes mellitus and ischemic stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and epilepsy. Such diseases have mutual biomarkers with ASD, which potentially could be a link to fill the gap of the literature studying the potential of repurposing the SGLT2 inhibitors' use in ameliorating the symptoms of ASD. This review will look at the impact of the SGLT2 inhibitors on neurodevelopmental disorders on the various models, including humans, rats, and mice, with a focus on the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin. Furthermore, this review will discuss how SGLT2 inhibitors regulate the ASD biomarkers, based on the clinical evidence supporting their functions as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB).",Nakhal MM; Aburuz S; Sadek B; Akour A,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36364000/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The low quantity of 25(OH)D during pregnancy can lead to an elevated risk for preeclampsia occurrence. Despite the numerous studies on the association of 25(OH)D deficiency and preeclampsia development, the current research on this theme is contradictory. In this review, we summarize and analyze study data on the effects of 25(OH)D deficiency and supplementation on pregnancy, labor, and fetal and neonatal outcomes.",Karpova N; Dmitrenko O; Arshinova E; Nurbekov M,International journal of molecular sciences,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36361738/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36308775,Effect of supplemental vitamin D3 on bone mineral density: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"There is still controversy over the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on bone health. The effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on bone mineral density (BMD) and markers of bone turnover, as well as the dose-response relationship between vitamin D3 and bone health in adults, were evaluated. The PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Web of Science, and AGRIS databases were searched for articles published through April 30, 2022. Thirty-nine of the 6409 records identified met the inclusion criteria. Data were extracted from articles by 2 authors, and data extraction was cross-checked independently. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled effect size and the associated 95%CI for the effect of vitamin D3 for each outcome. A one-stage random-effects dose-response model was used to estimate the dose-response relationship between vitamin D3 supplementation and BMD. Results of meta-analysis showed a beneficial effect of vitamin D3 at the lumbar spine (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.06; 95%CI, 0.01-0.12) and femoral neck (SMD = 0.25; 95%CI, 0.09-0.41). Dose-response analysis revealed a linear relationship between vitamin D3 supplementation doses and BMD at the femoral neck, lumbar spine, and total hip sites. No significant effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on whole-body or total hip BMD was observed (P > 0.05). Vitamin D3 supplementation significantly decreased BMD at both proximal and distal forearm (SMD = -0.16; 95%CI, -0.26 to -0.06). The variables of ethnicity, age, baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D), menopause status, vitamin D3 dosing frequency, and bone health status (P interaction = 0.02) altered the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on BMD. Additionally, a nonlinear relationship between vitamin D3 supplement doses and markers of bone turnover was found. A protective effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on BMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip is implicated.

36300856,Nutritional activities of luteolin in obesity and associated metabolic diseases: an eye on adipose tissues.,"Obesity is characterized by excessive body fat accumulation and is a high-risk factor for metabolic comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular disease. In lean individuals, adipose tissue (AT) is not only an important regulatory organ for energy storage and metabolism, but also an indispensable immune and endocrine organ. The sustained energy imbalance induces adipocyte hypotrophy and hyperplasia as well as AT remodeling, accompanied by chronic low-grade inflammation and adipocytes dysfunction in AT, ultimately leading to systemic insulin resistance and ectopic lipid deposition. Luteolin is a natural flavonoid widely distributed in fruits and vegetables and possesses multifold biological activities, such as antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory activities. Diet supplementation of this flavonoid has been reported to inhibit AT lipogenesis and inflammation as well as the ectopic lipid deposition, increase AT thermogenesis and systemic energy expenditure, and finally improve obesity and associated metabolic diseases. The purpose of this review is to reveal the nutritional activities of luteolin in obesity and its complications with emphasis on its action on AT energy metabolism, immunoregulation, and endocrine intervention.",Zhang Z; Wang J; Lin Y; Chen J; Liu J; Zhang X,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36300856/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36300654,Coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> in aging and disease.,"Coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> (CoQ<sub>10</sub>) is an essential component of the electron transport chain. It also acts as an antioxidant in cellular membranes. It can be endogenously produced in all cells by a specialized mitochondrial pathway. CoQ<sub>10</sub> deficiency, which can result from aging or insufficient enzyme function, has been considered to increase oxidative stress. Some drugs, including statins and bisphosphonates, often used by older individuals, can interfere with enzymes responsible for endogenous CoQ<sub>10</sub> synthesis. Oral supplementation with high doses of CoQ<sub>10</sub> can increase both its circulating and intracellular levels and several clinical trials observed that its administration provided beneficial effects on different disorders such as cardiovascular disease and inflammation which have been associated with low CoQ<sub>10</sub> levels and high oxidative stress. Moreover, CoQ<sub>10</sub> has been suggested as a promising therapeutic agent to prevent and slow the progression of other diseases including metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, neurodegenerative and male infertility. However, there is still a need for further studies and well-designed clinical trials involving a large number of participants undergoing longer treatments to assess the benefits of CoQ<sub>10</sub> for these disorders.",Gasmi A; Bjørklund G; Mujawdiya PK; Semenova Y; Piscopo S; Peana M,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36300654/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36297113,Do Nutrients and Nutraceuticals Play a Role in Diabetic Retinopathy? A Systematic Review.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a multifactorial neuro-microvascular disease, whose prevalence ranges from 25% to 60% of subjects affected by diabetes mellitus, representing the main cause of legal blindness in adults of industrialized countries. The treatment of advanced stage of DR is based on invasive and expensive therapies, while few strategies are available for the early stage or prevention. The mechanisms underlying DR involve a complex interplay between the detrimental effects of hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, hypoxia, and oxidative stress, providing several pathways potentially targeted by nutrients and nutraceuticals. In this study, we conducted a systematic review of observational and interventional studies, evaluating the effect of nutrients and/or nutraceuticals on the risk of DR and their potential use for the treatment of patients with DR. The analysis of the 41 included studies (27 observational and 14 interventional studies) suggests a promising preventive role of some nutrients, in particular for vitamins B (i.e., B1 and B12), D, and E. However, further investigations are necessary to clarify the potential clinical application of nutraceuticals in the prevention and treatment of DR.",Milluzzo A; Barchitta M; Maugeri A; Magnano San Lio R; Favara G; Mazzone MG; Sciacca L; Agodi A,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36297113/,0,1,0,0,0,0
36296982,Importance of Intermittent Fasting Regimens and Selection of Adequate Therapy on Inflammation and Oxidative Stress in SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,"The unpredictable nature of new variants of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-highly transmissible and some with vaccine-resistance, have led to an increased need for feasible lifestyle modifications as complementary therapies. Systemic inflammation is the common hallmark of communicable diseases like severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and non-communicable chronic diseases (NCDs) such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), diabetes mellitus, and cancers, all for which mitigation of severe outcomes is of paramount importance. Dietary quality is associated with NCDs, and intermittent fasting (IF) has been suggested as an effective approach for treatment and prevention of some NCDs, similar to that of caloric restriction. There is a paucity of high-quality data from randomized controlled trials regarding the impact of IF and the intake of specific nutrients on inflammation and post-infection outcomes in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The current review of recent literature was performed to explore the immunomodulatory roles of IF regimens and supplements involving the intake of specific nutrients including vitamins (A, B, C, D, and E), zinc, and nutraceuticals (n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, quercetin, and probiotics) on inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, with consideration of how they may be related to SARS-CoV-2.",Ezzati A; Rosenkranz SK; Horne BD,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36296982/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36287374,Vitamin D in the older population: a consensus statement.,"This paper reports results from the 5th International Conference ""Controversies in Vitamin D"" that was held in Stresa, Italy, 15-18 September 2021. The conference is part of this series that started in 2017 and has been conducted annually since. The objective of these conferences is to identify timely and controversial topics related to Vitamin D. Dissemination of the results of the conference through publications in peer-reviewed journals is an important means by which the most up to date information can be shared with physicians, investigators, and other health care professionals. Vitamin D and aging, the subject of this paper was featured at the conference. Participants were selected to review available literature on assigned topics related to vitamin D and aging and to present their findings with illustrative material, the intent of which was to stimulate discussion and to arrive at a consensus. The presentations were directed towards the following areas: impact of aging on vitamin D production and levels; skeletal effects of vitamin D deficiency in the older population; falls and vitamin D in the aging; potential extra skeletal effects of vitamin D; and strategies to prevent vitamin D deficiency. A final topic was related to how vitamin D might influence the efficacy of vaccines for Covid-19. Hypovitaminosis D can lead to several skeletal and extra-skeletal outcomes. Older adults are at risk for vitamin D deficiency as both production and metabolism of vitamin D change with aging due to factors, such as reduced sun exposure and reduced production capacity of the skin. Skeletal consequences of these age-related changes can include reduced bone mineral density, osteomalacia and fractures. Potential extra-skeletal effects can include added risks for falls, reduced muscle strength, diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Strategies to avoid these vitamin D deficiency-related negative outcomes include sun exposure, food fortification, and supplementation. While aging does not diminish sufficient reserve capacity for cutaneous vitamin D production, concerns about skin cancers and practical matters for the institutionalized elderly limit this option. Supplementation with vitamin D is the best option either pharmacologically or through food fortification. Regardless of treatment strategies, interventions to restore sufficient vitamin D status will show positive results only in those who are truly deficient. Thus, treatment goals should focus on avoiding 25(OH)D serum levels <30 nmol/l, with a goal to reach levels >50 nmol/l. The results of this conference has led to consensus on several issues. Vitamin D supplementation should be combined with calcium to reduce fractures in the older population. The goal for adequate Vitamin D status should be to reach a serum level of 25(OH)D >50 nmol/l. It appears that daily low-dose vitamin D regimens reduce the risk of falling, especially in the elderly, compared with infrequent, large bolus doses that may increase it. The role of Vitamin D supplementation on muscle strength remains to be clarified. On the other hand, supplementation decreases the risk of progression to T2D from prediabetes among those who are Vitamin Ddeficient. Of three possible strategies to establish vitamin D sufficiency - sunshine exposure, food fortification, and supplementation - the latter seems to be the most effective and practical in the aging population.",Giustina A; Bouillon R; Dawson-Hughes B; Ebeling PR; Lazaretti-Castro M; Lips P; Marcocci C; Bilezikian JP,Endocrine,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36287374/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36287325,"Role of vitamin D supplementation in the management of musculoskeletal diseases: update from an European Society of Clinical and Economical Aspects of Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases (ESCEO) working group.","Vitamin D is a key component for optimal growth and for calcium-phosphate homeostasis. Skin photosynthesis is the main source of vitamin D. Limited sun exposure and insufficient dietary vitamin D supply justify vitamin D supplementation in certain age groups. In older adults, recommended doses for vitamin D supplementation vary between 200 and 2000 IU/day, to achieve a goal of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcifediol) of at least 50 nmol/L. The target level depends on the population being supplemented, the assessed system, and the outcome. Several recent large randomized trials with oral vitamin D regimens varying between 2000 and 100,000 IU/month and mostly conducted in vitamin D-replete and healthy individuals have failed to detect any efficacy of these approaches for the prevention of fracture and falls. Considering the well-recognized major musculoskeletal disorders associated with severe vitamin D deficiency and taking into account a possible biphasic effects of vitamin D on fracture and fall risks, an European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases (ESCEO) working group convened, carefully reviewed, and analyzed the meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials on the effects of vitamin D on fracture risk, falls or osteoarthritis, and came to the conclusion that 1000 IU daily should be recommended in patients at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency.

The important findings from the research conducted using various nutraceuticals exhibiting significant physiological and pharmacological activities have been summarized. An extensive investigation of literature was done using several worldwide electronic scientific databases like PUBMED, SCOPUS, Science Direct, Google Scholar, etc. The entire manuscript is available in the English language that is used for our various compounds of interest. These databases were thoroughly reviewed and summarized. Nutraceuticals obtained from various sources play a vital role in the management of peripheral neuropathy associated with diabetes. Treatment with nutraceuticals has been beneficial as an alternative in preventing the progression. In particular, in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed that a variety of nutraceuticals have significant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may inhibit the early diabetes-driven molecular mechanisms that induce DPN. Nutraceuticals obtained from different sources like a plant, an animal, and marine have been properly utilized for the safety of health. In our opinion, this review could be of great interest to clinicians, as it offers a complementary perspective on the management of DPN.

Studies reporting the efficacy of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> supplementation in metformin-treated T2DM patients were systematically searched in PubMed, Cochrane, EBSCOHost, and Scopus following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. Additional relevant studies were searched manually through citations. Study quality and risk of bias were assessed using suitable tools. Seven clinical trials with a total of 506 participants were included. Using the Cochrane's Risk of Bias 2 tools for clinical trials, 4 studies were assessed to have high risk of bias and 3 studies had low risk of bias. There were 5 studies that measured changes in serum vitamin B<sub>12</sub> level, all of which reported a statistically significant increase after supplementation. Significant reductions in homocysteine after supplementation were found in 2 studies. Its effect on neuropathy symptoms was still unclear, with 2 studies reporting a significant improvement and 1 study reporting no significant effect. The results of this systematic review support the implementation of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> supplementation for metformin-treated T2DM to prevent or treat vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency and neuropathy.

36235800,"Definition, Assessment, and Management of Vitamin D Inadequacy: Suggestions, Recommendations, and Warnings from the Italian Society for Osteoporosis, Mineral Metabolism and Bone Diseases (SIOMMMS).","In the recent years, both the prescriptions of serum 25(OH)D levels assay, and vitamin D supplementation are constantly increasing, as well as the costs to be incurred relating to these specific aspects. As in many other countries, the risk of vitamin D deficiency is particularly high in Italy, as recently confirmed by cohort studies in the general population as well as in patients with metabolic bone disorder. Results confirmed the North-South gradient of vitamin D levels described among European countries, despite the wide use of supplements. Although vitamin D supplementation is also recommended by the Italian Medicine Agency for patients at risk for fragility fracture or for initiating osteoporotic medication, the therapeutic gap for osteoporosis in Italy is very high. There is a consistent proportion of osteoporotic patients not receiving specific therapy for osteoporosis following a fragility fracture, with a poor adherence to the recommendations provided by national guidelines and position paper documents. The failure or inadequate supplementation with vitamin D in patients on antiresorptive or anabolic treatment for osteoporosis is thought to further amplify the problem and exposes patients to a high risk of re-fracture and mortality. Therefore, it is important that attention to its possible clinical consequences must be given. Thus, in light of new evidence from the literature, the SIOMMMS board felt the need to revise and update, by a GRADE/PICO system approach, its previous original recommendations about the definition, prevention, and treatment of vitamin D deficiency in adults, released in 2011. Several key points have been here addressed, such as the definition of the vitamin D status: normality values and optimal values; who are the subjects considered at risk of hypovitaminosis D; opportunity or not of performing the biochemical assessment of serum 25(OH)D levels in general population and in subjects at risk of hypovitaminosis D; the need or not to evaluate baseline serum 25(OH)D in candidate subjects for pharmacological treatment for osteoporosis; how and whether to supplement vitamin D subjects with hypovitaminosis D or candidates for pharmacological treatment with bone active agents, and the general population; how and whether to supplement vitamin D in chronic kidney disease and/or chronic liver diseases or under treatment with drugs interfering with hepatic metabolism; and finally, if vitamin D may have toxic effects in the subject in need of supplementation.",Bertoldo F; Cianferotti L; Di Monaco M; Falchetti A; Fassio A; Gatti D; Gennari L; Giannini S; Girasole G; Gonnelli S; Malavolta N; Minisola S; Pedrazzoni M; Rendina D; Rossini M; Chiodini I,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36235800/,1,0,0,0,0,0

36227457,Iodine status and supplementation in pregnancy: an overview of the evidence provided by meta-analyses.,"Iodine supplementation during pregnancy in areas with mild-moderate deficiency is still a matter of debate. The present study aimed at systematically reviewing currently available evidences provided by meta-analyses with the aim to further clarify controversial aspects regarding the need of iodine supplementation in pregnancy as well as to provide guidance on clinical decision-making, even in areas with mild-moderate deficiency. Medline, Embase and Cochrane search from 1969 to 2022 were performed. For the purpose of this review, only studies containing meta-analytic data were selected. A total of 7 meta-analyses were retrieved. Four meta-analyses evaluated the relationship between iodine status during pregnancy and neonatal and maternal outcomes suggesting the existence of a U-shaped correlation between iodine status and several maternal and neonatal consequences, especially if iodine status is evaluated at the beginning of pregnancy. Three meta-analyses evaluating the results of intervention trials failed to provide straightforward conclusions on the benefits of iodine supplementation in pregnant women in areas with mild-moderate iodine deficiency. Although evidence coming from meta-analyses suggests a role of iodine status during pregnancy in determining maternal and child outcomes, results of meta-analyses of intervention trials are still controversial. Several factors including, degree of iodine deficiency, and pooling studies conducted in areas with different iodine intake, may account for the lack of benefits reported by meta-analyses of intervention trials. More high-quality, randomized, controlled trials including information on timing, dose and regimen of iodine supplementation are needed to further elucidate this issue.",Croce L; Chiovato L; Tonacchera M; Petrosino E; Tanda ML; Moleti M; Magri F; Olivieri A; Pearce EN; Rotondi M,Reviews in endocrine & metabolic disorders,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36227457/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36200449,Impact of iron supplementation on gestational diabetes mellitus: A literature review.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common complication of pregnancy, affecting 14% of pregnancies worldwide, and the prevention of pathological hyperglycaemia during pregnancy is meaningful for global public health. The role of iron supplementation in the progression of GDM has been of significant interest in recent years. Iron is a micronutrient that is vital during pregnancy; however, given the toxic properties of excess iron, it is probable that prophylactic iron supplementation will increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including GDM. It is critical to clarify the effect of iron supplementation on the risk of GDM. Therefore, in this review, we comprehensively assess the role of iron in pregnancy. This review aimed to analyse the necessity of iron supplementation and maintenance of iron homeostasis during pregnancy, particularly reviewing the role and function of iron in beta cells and examining the mechanisms of excess iron contributing to the pathogenesis of GDM. Moreover, we aimed to discuss the association of haemoglobin and ferritin with GDM and identify priority areas for research.",Liu L; Yan F; Yan H; Wang Z,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36200449/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36184216,Effects of zinc supplementation on glycemic control and oxidative stress in experimental diabetes: A systematic review.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM), an important public health problem worldwide, can cause imbalances in the homeostasis of trace elements such as zinc (Zn). It is possible that an adequate nutritional status related to nutrients is essential for the normal functioning of antioxidant defense systems, and any change in the concentration of these substances could increase the chances of DM complications. To present a review on the effect of zinc supplementation on glycemic control and oxidative stress in experimental diabetes. This is a systematic review of articles that investigated the effects of zinc supplementation on glycemic control and oxidative stress in diabetic rats. The PICOS strategy was used for the development of the research question, and the Syrcle tool for the quality assessment of the studies included in the review. Articles available in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were included without restriction on year of publication. The Syrcle tool was used to assess the risk of bias of the included studies. Fifteen studies were included in the review, seven of which evaluated glycemic control and oxidative stress after zinc supplementation, five only oxidative stress and three only glycemic control after zinc treatment. In all the studies included, diabetes was induced by the administration of streptozotocin (STZ) at doses ranging from 40 to 100 mg/kg. Zinc supplementation was made in the diet or drinking water or by gavage or intraperitoneal injection. The most used doses were 100 mg/kg of body weight by gavage and 0.32 and 0.64 g/kg in diet. The supplementation period ranged from 14 days to 8 weeks. Six studies revealed that zinc supplementation decreased fasting blood glucose as well as insulin resistance; nine studies included in this review reported decreased MDA concentration; in five studies, there was an increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes (GPx, SOD, GSH and catalase); and one of the studies reported a reduction in glycated hemoglobin. Zinc supplementation improved hyperglycemia and revealed a protective potential against oxidative stress associated with experimental diabetes.",Martins MDPSC; Oliveira ASDSS; Martins MDCCE; Carvalho VBL; Rodrigues LARL; Arcanjo DDR; Santos MAPD; Machado JSR; de Moura Rocha M,Clinical nutrition ESPEN,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36184216/,0,1,0,0,0,0
36180970,Yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis A. St.-Hil.) for new therapeutic and nutraceutical interventions: A review of patents issued in the last 20 years (2000-2020).,"It has been estimated that more than 70% of all drugs approved worldwide between 1981 and 2006 for human health are derived from or structurally similar to natural compounds. The identification of biological matrices containing bioactive compounds with therapeutic and nutraceutical potential is necessary to supply the global market demands. Researches have indicated that the consumption of dry and aqueous extracts of Ilex paraguariensis A. St.-Hil. is safe, providing that plant biomass does not be exposed to smoke over the drying process, avoiding contamination (e.g., ) with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, and can might help avoiding many diseases, with important potential applications in the pharma and nutraceutical industries. A survey was carried out covering the main therapeutic and nutraceutical studies performed on I. paraguariensis extracts and their relationship with the global patents granted in the last 20 years for the products using this specie in their composition. In the PubMed database, by searching for the term ""Ilex paraguariensis,"" an output with 497 scientific publications was found. Each paper was analyzed individually and 26 publications encompassing exclusively therapeutical and nutraceutical approaches of that plant species were selected. For the patent screening regarding Ilex-derived products, the survey considered three patent databases: European Patent Office (EPO) (Espacenet), World Intellectual Property Organization, WIPO), and National Institute of Industrial Property (NIIP-Brazil). The criterion chosen to select the patents in the databases was the inclusion of the terms ""Ilex paraguariensis"" and ""yerba mate"" in the title and/or in the abstract, considering the patents issued from 2000 to 2020. Additionally, only patents with therapeutic and nutraceutical potential were considered on the survey. The screening and selection of the documents were performed independently by two researchers and the information cross-checked at the end. This review contributes to show the state of the art over the last 20 years on the knowledge about the therapeutical and nutraceutical usages of the yerba mate, associated to a certain number of issued patents. The patent survey afforded 62 relevant documents covering products based on Ilex paraguariensis biomass. Considering the number of patents issued, most of them are related to the pharmaceutical area (30), followed by food supplements and beverages (17), cosmetics (10) and, finally, nutraceuticals (5). A detailed analysis of the patents issued showed that most are related to pharmaceutical grade products, generally, marketed as oral and injectable compositions for treatments of obesity, insulin resistance, hyperlipemia and diabetes mellitus, arteriosclerosis, neurological diseases, and SARS-Cov-2, for example. In this work, a curious fact is that there are few patents for food, cosmetics, and nutraceuticals products containing yerba mate. Therefore, it seems to be relevant to take into account the potential of that species as source of bioactive compounds for the development of new products not only intended to the pharma sector. In this sense, 26 reports were identified showing possibilities and trendiness in developing new yerba mate based products, such as packaging, biopesticides, antiseptics, and food supply, expanding the possibilities of technological applications of this plant species.",Gerber T; Nunes A; Moreira BR; Maraschin M,Phytotherapy research : PTR,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36180970/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36166847,Effects of Fish-Oil Consumption on Psychological Function Outcomes in Psychosis: A Systematic Review and Dose-Response Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"Research on the effects of fish oil on clinical symptoms and psychosocial functioning in people with psychosis has been inconsistent. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the available data on the effects of oral intake of fish oil on psychological functioning in patients with psychosis. Three online databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched to identify relevant studies published by April 2021. The exposure was oral fish-oil supplementation. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) were our outcome measures. Seventeen randomized clinical trials involving 1390 patients were included. No change in PANSS was observed following oral fish-oil intake [weighted mean difference (WMD): -0.87; 95% CI: -16.99, 15.26; P = 0.92]. In a nonlinear dose-response analysis, a significant inverse association was observed between <10 wk of fish-oil supplementation and PANSS (WMD: -10; P-nonlinearity = 0.02). Although analysis of 4 studies showed a nonsignificant reduction in BPRS after fish-oil intake (WMD: -2.990; 95% CI: -6.42, 0.44; P = 0.08), a nonlinear dose-response analysis revealed significant inverse associations between dose (>2200 mg/d) and duration of fish-oil supplementation (<15 wk) with BPRS score (WMD: -8; P-nonlinearity = 0.04). Combined effect sizes from 6 randomized clinical trials showed significant increases in GAF after oral administration of fish oil (WMD: 6.66; 95% CI: 3.39, 9.93; P < 0.001). In conclusion, we did not find any significant changes in PANSS and BPRS scores following fish-oil supplementation. Nevertheless, oral fish-oil intake significantly contributed to improvement in GAF scores. This is the first meta-analysis to examine the effects of fish oil on the psychological functioning scores of PANSS, BPRS, and GAF simultaneously.",Montazer M; Ebrahimpour-Koujan S; Surkan PJ; Azadbakht L,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36166847/,0,1,0,1,0,0
36147505,A review on the importance of miRNA-135 in human diseases.,"MicroRNA-135 (miR-135) is a microRNA which is involved in the pathoetiology of several neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions. Both tumor suppressor and oncogenic roles have been reported for this miRNA. Studies in prostate, renal, gallbladder and nasopharyngeal cancers as well as glioma have shown down-regulation of miR-135 in cancerous tissues compared with controls. These studies have also shown the impact of miR-135 down-regulation on enhancement of cell proliferation and aggressive behavior. Meanwhile, miR-135 has been shown to be up-regulated in bladder, oral, colorectal and liver cancers. Studies in breast, gastric, lung and pancreatic cancers as well as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma have reported dual roles for miR-135. Dysregulation of miR-135 has also been noted in various non-neoplastic conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, depression, diabetes, Parkinson, pulmonary arterial hypertension, nephrotic syndrome, endometriosis, epilepsy and allergic conditions. In the current review, we summarize the role of miR-135 in the carcinogenesis as well as development of other disorders.",Kadkhoda S; Eslami S; Mahmud Hussen B; Ghafouri-Fard S,Frontiers in genetics,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36147505/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36145186,Comparing the Evidence from Observational Studies and Randomized Controlled Trials for Nonskeletal Health Effects of Vitamin D.,"Although observational studies of health outcomes generally suggest beneficial effects with, or following, higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have generally not supported those findings. Here we review results from observational studies and RCTs regarding how vitamin D status affects several nonskeletal health outcomes, including Alzheimer's disease and dementia, autoimmune diseases, cancers, cardiovascular disease, COVID-19, major depressive disorder, type 2 diabetes, arterial hypertension, all-cause mortality, respiratory tract infections, and pregnancy outcomes. We also consider relevant findings from ecological, Mendelian randomization, and mechanistic studies. Although clear discrepancies exist between findings of observational studies and RCTs on vitamin D and human health benefits these findings should be interpreted cautiously. Bias and confounding are seen in observational studies and vitamin D RCTs have several limitations, largely due to being designed like RCTs of therapeutic drugs, thereby neglecting vitamin D's being a nutrient with a unique metabolism that requires specific consideration in trial design. Thus, RCTs of vitamin D can fail for several reasons: few participants' having low baseline 25(OH)D concentrations, relatively small vitamin D doses, participants' having other sources of vitamin D, and results being analyzed without consideration of achieved 25(OH)D concentrations. Vitamin D status and its relevance for health outcomes can usefully be examined using Hill's criteria for causality in a biological system from results of observational and other types of studies before further RCTs are considered and those findings would be useful in developing medical and public health policy, as they were for nonsmoking policies. A promising approach for future RCT design is adjustable vitamin D supplementation based on interval serum 25(OH)D concentrations to achieve target 25(OH)D levels suggested by findings from observational studies.",Grant WB; Boucher BJ; Al Anouti F; Pilz S,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36145186/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36145129,Polyphenol Intake in Pregnant Women on Gestational Diabetes Risk and Neurodevelopmental Disorders in Offspring: A Systematic Review.,"The intake of foods containing polyphenols can have a protective role to avoid comorbidities during pregnancy and, at the same time, promote transgenerational health. This review aims to describe the effect of polyphenol intake through supplements or polyphenol-rich foods during pregnancy on the incidence and evolution of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), as well as the link with the neurodevelopment of the fetus. Using PRISMA procedures, a systematic review was conducted by searching in biomedical databases (PubMed, Cinahl and Scopus) from January to June 2022. Full articles were screened (<i>n</i> = 419) and critically appraised. Fourteen studies were selected and were divided into two different thematic blocks considering (i) the effect of polyphenols in GDM and (ii) the effect of GDM to mental disorders in the offspring. A positive relationship was observed between the intake of polyphenols and the prevention and control of cardiometabolic complications during pregnancy, such as GDM, which could be related to thwarted inflammatory and oxidative processes, as well as neuronal factors. GDM is related to a greater risk of suffering from diseases related to neurodevelopment, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder and learning disorder. Further clinical research on the molecule protective mechanism of polyphenols on pregnant women is required to understand the transgenerational impact on fetal neurodevelopment.",Salinas-Roca B; Rubió-Piqué L; Montull-López A,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36145129/,0,1,0,0,0,0
36144329,Modulating Microbiota as a New Strategy for Breast Cancer Prevention and Treatment.,"Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women in the United States. There has been an increasing incidence and decreasing mortality rate of BC cases over the past several decades. Many risk factors are associated with BC, such as diet, aging, personal and family history, obesity, and some environmental factors. Recent studies have shown that healthy individuals and BC patients have different microbiota composition, indicating that microbiome is a new risk factor for BC. Gut and breast microbiota alterations are associated with BC prognosis. This review will evaluate altered microbiota populations in gut, breast tissue, and milk of BC patients, as well as mechanisms of interactions between microbiota modulation and BC. Probiotics and prebiotics are commercially available dietary supplements to alleviate side-effects of cancer therapies. They also shape the population of human gut microbiome. This review evaluates novel means of modulating microbiota by nutritional treatment with probiotics and prebiotics as emerging and promising strategies for prevention and treatment of BC. The mechanistic role of probiotic and prebiotics partially depend on alterations in estrogen metabolism, systematic immune regulation, and epigenetics regulation.",Wu H; Ganguly S; Tollefsbol TO,Microorganisms,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36144329/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36130103,"Dose-Response Effect of Coenzyme Q10 Supplementation on Blood Pressure among Patients with Cardiometabolic Disorders: A Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE)-Assessed Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.","Previous studies have shown beneficial effects of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) supplementation on blood pressure (BP). However, the optimal intake of CoQ10 for BP regulation in patients with cardiometabolic disorders is unknown, and its effect on circulating CoQ10 is also unclear. We aimed to assess the dose-response relation between CoQ10 and BP, and quantify the effect of CoQ10 supplementation on the concentration of circulating CoQ10 by synthesizing available evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A comprehensive literature search was performed in 3 databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library) to 21 March, 2022. A novel 1-stage restricted cubic spline regression model was used to evaluate the nonlinear dose-response relation between CoQ10 and BP. Twenty-six studies comprising 1831 subjects were included in our meta-analysis. CoQ10 supplementation significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) (-4.77 mmHg, 95% CI: -6.57, -2.97) in patients with cardiometabolic diseases; this reduction was accompanied by a 1.62 (95% CI: 1.26, 1.97) μg/mL elevation of circulating CoQ10 compared with the control group. Subgroup analyses revealed that the effects of reducing SBP were more pronounced in patients with diabetes and dyslipidemia and in studies with longer durations (>12 wk). Importantly, a U-shaped dose-response relation was observed between CoQ10 supplementation and SBP level, with an approximate dose of 100-200 mg/d largely reducing SBP (χ2 = 10.84, Pnonlinearity = 0.004). The quality of evidence was rated as moderate, low, and very low for SBP, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and circulating CoQ10 according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach (GRADE), respectively. The current finding demonstrated that the clinically beneficial effects of CoQ10 supplementation may be attributed to the reduction in SBP, and 100-200 mg/d of CoQ10 supplementation may achieve the greatest benefit on SBP in patients with cardiometabolic diseases. This study was registered on PROSPERO as CRD42021252933.",Zhao D; Liang Y; Dai S; Hou S; Liu Z; Liu M; Dong X; Zhan Y; Tian Z; Yang Y,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36130103/,0,1,0,1,0,0
36129664,Fragility of cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) examining nutrition interventions among patients with diabetes mellitus: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials.,"There is controversy regarding the optimal statistical method to interpret how robust is a statistically significant result. The fragility index (FI) and the reverse fragility index (RFI) are quantitative measures that can facilitate the appraisal of a clinical trial's robustness. This study was performed to evaluate the FI and RFI of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining nutritional interventions in patients with diabetes mellitus, focusing on cardiovascular outcomes. A systematic search was conducted and relevant RCTs were identified in three databases. RCTs examining nutritional interventions (supplements or dietary patterns) in patients with DM with dichotomous primary endpoints involving cardiovascular outcomes were eligible. Data were extracted to compose 2 × 2 event tables and the FI and RFI were calculated for each comparison, using Fisher's exact test. Risk of bias (RoB) of the included RCTs was assessed with the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. A total of 14,315 records were screened and 10 RCTs were included in the analyses. The median FI of the paired comparisons was 3 (IQR: 2-4) and the median RFI was 8 (IQR: 4.5-17). RoB and heterogeneity were low. RCTs examining nutritional interventions and cardiovascular outcomes among patients with diabetes mellitus appear to be statistically fragile. Τhe FI and the RFI can be reported and interpreted as an additional perspective of a trial's robustness. • In the evidence-healthcare era, assessing how robust statistically significant results are remains a matter of controversy. • Recently, the fragility index (FI) and reverse fragility index (RFI) were proposed to assess the robustness of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 2 × 2 comparisons. • When applying the FI and RFI, RCTs examining nutritional interventions and cardiovascular outcomes among patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) appear to be statistically fragile. • Τhe FI and the RFI can be reported and interpreted as an additional perspective of a trial's robustness. • RCTs implementing nutrition interventions among patients with DM can improve their methodology.",Taouktsi N; Papageorgiou ST; Tousinas G; Papanikolopoulou S; Grammatikopoulou MG; Giannakoulas G; Goulis DG,"Hormones (Athens, Greece)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36129664/,0,1,0,0,0,0
36111759,Ancient Wheat as Promising Nutraceuticals for the Prevention of Chronic and Degenerative Diseases.,"In the context of a balanced diet, wheat, mainly used as whole grains, is a good source of nutrients, including fibers and bioactive compounds. Cereals belong to the Poaceae family and are crucial for maintaining a healthy status, granted by their nutritional and chemical properties. Recent studies have demonstrated that the intake of whole grains and grain-based products may reduce the risk of oxidative stress, thus lowering chronic and age-related disorders, such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, type II diabetes and cancer. Indeed, several studies report that regular whole grain consumption is associated with lower levels of total and LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, blood pressure and body mass index. Moreover, ancient wheat species have become increasingly interested in human health, containing several nutraceutical compounds, such as vitamins and minerals. The numerous phytochemicals present in ancient wheat (polyphenols, carotenoids, phytosterols and phenolic compounds) provide, in fact, antioxidant properties, which are essential in the prevention of various chronic and degenerative diseases.

36073729,Therapeutic potential of dietary flavonoid hyperoside against non-communicable diseases: targeting underlying properties of diseases.,"Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are a global epidemic with diverse pathogenesis. Among them, oxidative stress and inflammation are the most fundamental co-morbid features. Therefore, multi-targets and multi-pathways therapies with significant anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are potential effective measures for preventing and treating NCDs. The flavonol glycoside compound hyperoside (Hyp) is widely found in a variety of fruits, vegetables, beverages, and medicinal plants and has various health benefits, especially excellent anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties targeting nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathways. In this review, we summarize the pathogenesis associated with oxidative stress and inflammation in NCDs and the biological activity and therapeutic potential of Hyp. Our findings reveal that the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities regulated by Hyp are associated with numerous biological mechanisms, including positive regulation of mitochondrial function, apoptosis, autophagy, and higher-level biological damage activities.

36060956,Guidance for high-dose vitamin D supplementation for prolonging the honeymoon phase in children and adolescents with new-onset type 1 diabetes.,"The publication of our recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) showing that vitamin D could protect the β-cells during the honeymoon phase of type 1 diabetes (T1D) has led to calls for guidance for vitamin D supplementation during the critical phase of type 1 diabetes. Prolonging the partial clinical remission (PR) phase of TID improves glycemic control and reduces long-term complications of T1D. This RCT randomized 36 children and adolescents to either receive vitamin D<sub>2</sub> (ergocalciferol, given as 50,000 international units per week for 2 months and then every other week for 10 months) or a placebo. The results showed that vitamin D significantly decreased the temporal rise in both hemoglobin A1c at a mean rate of changes of 0.14% every 3 months versus 0.46% every 3 months for the placebo group (p=0.044); and in the functional marker of PR, the insulin-dose adjusted A1c at a mean rate of change of 0.30% every 3 months versus 0.77% every 3 months for the placebo group, (p=0.015). We recommend a baseline estimation of 25(OH)D concentration at the time of diagnosis of T1D, and to begin vitamin D supplementation if serum 25(OH)D concentration is <30 ng/mL, to maintain serum 25(OH)D concentrations between 30-60 ng/mL. If serum 25(OH)D concentration is >30 ng/mL, monitor vitamin D status with serial 25(OH)D estimations; and initiate vitamin D supplementation if serum 25(OH)D concentrations drop to <30 ng/mL. Continue vitamin D supplementation for at least one year to ensure optimal benefit from vitamin D supplementation during the partial clinical remission phase of type 1 diabetes.",Nwosu BU,Frontiers in endocrinology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36060956/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Various mechanisms have been proposed; however, several studies have not considered the correlations between the anti-T2DM activity of NSPs and their molecular structure. Moreover, the current understanding of the role of NSPs in T2DM treatment is mainly based on <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> data, and more human clinical trials are required to verify the actual efficacy in treating T2DM. The related anti-T2DM mechanisms of NSPs, including regulating insulin action, promoting glucose metabolism and regulating postprandial blood glucose level, anti-inflammatory and regulating gut microbiota (GM), are reviewed. The structure-function relationships are summarized, and the relationships between NSPs structure and anti-T2DM activity from clinical trials are highlighted. The development of anti-T2DM medication or dietary supplements of NSPs could be promoted with an in-depth understanding of the multiple regulatory effects in the treatment/intervention of T2DM.",Xiao M; Jia X; Wang N; Kang J; Hu X; Goff HD; Cui SW; Ding H; Guo Q,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36036965/,1,0,0,0,0,0

However, clinical trials have shown mixed findings. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effects of probiotics and synbiotics intake on glycemic outcomes among individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The PubMed/Medline, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and Cochrane library were searched up to March 2022 for published RCTs exploring the effectiveness of probiotics and synbiotics compared to control on glycemic outcomes. The random-effects model was applied in order to the estimation of 95 % confidence interval (CI) and the weighted mean difference (WMD) for each endpoint.

Peripheral vascular disease is growing in its burden and impact; however it is currently under researched, and there are a lack of strong, non-invasive therapeutic options for the clinicians. Carnosine is a dipeptide stored particularly in muscle and brain tissue, which exhibits a wide range of physiological activities, which may be beneficial as an adjunct treatment for peripheral vascular disease. Carnosine's strong anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiglycating actions may aid in the prevention of plaque formation, through protective actions on the vascular endothelium, and the inhibition of foam cells. Carnosine may also improve angiogenesis, exercise performance and vasodilatory response, while protecting from ischemic tissue injury. Carnosine may have a role as an adjunct treatment for peripheral vascular disease alongside typical exercise and surgical interventions, and may be used in high risk individuals to aid in the prevention of atherogenesis. This review identifies a beneficial role for carnosine supplementation in the management of patients with peripheral vascular disease, in conjunction with exercise and revascularization.

For dental practitioners this includes periodontitis or peri-implantitis, the focus of this issue. Many risk factors are involved in the development of disease and most likely interact or overlap. Most patients will probably have multiple risk factors, some of which will be the same for both periodontitis and peri-implantitis. The most recent classification of periodontal disease recognises the importance of risk factors and contemporary dental practice requires that clinicians be aware of and manage them. Broadly speaking risk factors can be patient, environment or practitioner related. Patient risk factors would include socio-economic status, smoking, substance use disorders, diabetes, diet and dietary supplements, mental health disorders, old age, poor home dental care or understanding of the need for good home care and use of medications. Environmental modification of the host response through gene function is an emerging risk factor. Lastly, practitioner-related factors in implant dentistry are now known to affect risk. These would include the use of digital technology, but patient related factors such implant location and the body's reaction to an implant itself add to the risk of developing disease.

PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, and Cochrane library were systematically searched for randomized controlled trails (RCTs) in this field until May 2022. Primary outcomes were the incidence for GDM and plasma glucose levels by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Pooled results were expressed as relative risk (RR) or mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Seven RCTs with 1321 participants were included in this study. Compared with the control group, 4 g myo-inositol (MI) supplementation per day significantly decreased the incidence of GDM (RR = 0.30, 95% CI (0.18, 0.49), p < 0.00001). It significantly decreased the plasma glucose levels of OGTT regarding fasting-glucose OGTT (MD = −4.20, 95% CI (−5.87, −2.54), p < 0.00001), 1-h OGTT (MD = −8.75, 95% CI (−12.42, −5.08), p < 0.00001), and 2-h OGTT (MD = −8.59, 95% CI (−11.81, −5.83), p < 0.00001). It also decreased the need of insulin treatment, and reduced the incidence of preterm delivery and neonatal hypoglycemia. However, no difference was observed between 1.1 g MI per day plus 27.6 mg D-chiro-inositol (DCI) per day and the control group regarding all evaluated results. In conclusion, 4 g MI nutritional supplementation per day during early pregnancy may reduce GDM incidence and severity, therefore may be a practical and safe approach for the prevention of GDM.",Wei J; Yan J; Yang H,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35889788/,0,1,0,1,0,0

35850934,Effects of vitamin D supplementation on glycemic control of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review.,"To evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycemic control in children and adolescents with T1DM. A systematic search was conducted of the Medline/PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, BVS/Lilacs, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Cinahl, Food Science, and FSTA databases. Two reviewers independently extracted article data and assessed quality. A total of 1,613 eligible articles were retrieved, ten of which met the selection criteria: eight clinical trials, one retrospective cohort study, and one cross-sectional study. Regarding the cutoff points used to classify vitamin D status, most of the studies set deficiency at 25-hydroxyvitamin D <20 ng/mL, sufficiency at ≥30 ng/mL, and insufficiency as the interval between these values. Regarding intervention strategies, most used cholecalciferol for supplementation, but there was great variation in the dose and supplementation time. When evaluating the effect of vitamin D supplementation on HbA1c, a significant improvement in glycemic control was observed in 50% of the studies. However, only one of these studies was classified as being of positive methodological quality, with three having their quality classified as neutral and one as negative. There is yet no consistent evidence on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycemic control as an adjuvant in the treatment of children and adolescents with T1DM.",Nascimento BF; Moreira CFF; da Fonseca ER; Fedeszen PMK; de Paula TP; de Sena ASS; de Almeida NFA; Bandeira Filho OCS; Curval DR; Padilha PC,Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : JPEM,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35850934/,0,1,0,0,0,0
35848122,Selenium nanoparticles: Enhanced nutrition and beyond.,"Selenium is a trace nutrient that has both nutritional and nutraceutical functions, whereas narrow nutritional range of selenium intake limits its use. Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) are less toxic and more bioavailable than traditional forms of selenium, suggesting that SeNPs have the potential to replace traditional selenium in food industries and/or biomedical fields. From the perspective of how SeNPs can be applied in health area, this review comprehensively discusses SeNPs in terms of its preparation, nutritional aspect, detoxification effect of heavy metals, nutraceutical functions and anti-pathogenic microorganism effects. By physical, chemical, or biological methods, inorganic selenium can be transformed into SeNPs which have increased stability and bioavailability as well as low toxicity. SeNPs are more effective than traditional selenium form in synthesizing selenoproteins like glutathione peroxidases. SeNPs can reshape the digestive system to facilitate digestion and absorption of nutrients. SeNPs have shown excellent potential to adjunctively treat cancer patients, enhance immune system, control diabetes, and prevent rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, SeNPs have good microbial anti-pathogenic effects and can be used with other antimicrobial agents to fight against pathogenic bacteria, fungi, or viruses. Development of novel SeNPs with enhanced functions can greatly benefit the food-, nutraceutical-, and biomedical industries.",Chen N; Yao P; Zhang W; Zhang Y; Xin N; Wei H; Zhang T; Zhao C,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35848122/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35843472,Effect of flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum) supplementation on glycemic control and insulin resistance in prediabetes and type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Prediabetes and type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) are characterized by increased blood sugar concentration and insulin resistance. Although there are only a few reports of potential benefits of flaxseed's consumption on different metabolic parameters, there is no evidence of its effect among people with these conditions. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the effect of flaxseed supplementation on glycemic control variables and insulin resistance in prediabetes and T2DM. A literature search was conducted through PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Web of Science, to identify Randomized Control Trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effect of milled or ground flaxseed supplementation on fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, insulin concentrations, or HOMA-IR. The data were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software version 3.3 in a fixed-effect model. Seven studies were included in the systematic review and the meta-analysis, the results showed a significant reduction on fasting blood sugar (SMD: -0.392, 95% CI: -0.596, -0.187, p = <0.001, I<sup>2</sup> = 64.81%) insulin concentrations, (SMD: -0.287, 95% CI: -0.534, -0.041, p = 0.022, I<sup>2</sup> = 32.53%), HbA1c (SMD: -0.442, 95% CI: -0.770, -0.114, p = 0.008, I<sup>2</sup> = 11.058%), and HOMA-IR (SMD: -0.284, 95% CI: -0.530, -0.038, p = 0.024, I<sup>2</sup> = 0.00%) after flaxseed supplementation.

35814725,Dietary factors that affect the risk of pre-eclampsia.,"Pre-eclampsia affects 3%-5% of pregnant women worldwide and is associated with a range of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, including maternal and/or fetal death. It particularly affects those with chronic hypertension, pregestational diabetes mellitus or a family history of pre-eclampsia. Other than early delivery of the fetus, there is no cure for pre-eclampsia. Since diet or dietary supplements may affect the risk, we have carried out an up-to-date, narrative literature review to assess the relationship between nutrition and pre-eclampsia. Several nutrients and dietary factors previously believed to be implicated in the risk of pre-eclampsia have now been shown to have no effect on risk; these include vitamins C and E, magnesium, salt, ω-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (fish oils) and zinc. Body mass index is proportionally correlated with pre-eclampsia risk, therefore women should aim for a healthy pre-pregnancy body weight and avoid excessive gestational and interpregnancy weight gain. The association between the risk and progression of the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia may explain the apparent benefit of dietary modifications resulting from increased consumption of fruits and vegetables (≥400 g/day), plant-based foods and vegetable oils and a limited intake of foods high in fat, sugar and salt. Consuming a high-fibre diet (25-30 g/day) may attenuate dyslipidaemia and reduce blood pressure and inflammation. Other key nutrients that may mitigate the risk include increased calcium intake, a daily multivitamin/mineral supplement and an adequate vitamin D status. For those with a low selenium intake (such as those living in Europe), fish/seafood intake could be increased to improve selenium intake or selenium could be supplemented in the recommended multivitamin/mineral supplement. Milk-based probiotics have also been found to be beneficial in pregnant women at risk. Our recommendations are summarised in a table of guidance for women at particular risk of developing pre-eclampsia.",Perry A; Stephanou A; Rayman MP,"BMJ nutrition, prevention & health",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35814725/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35807808,Prolonged Isolated Soluble Dietary Fibre Supplementation in Overweight and Obese Patients: A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis of Randomised Controlled Trials.,"The prevalence of overweight and obesity is rising rapidly, currently affecting 1.9 billion adults worldwide. Prebiotic dietary fibre supplementation is a promising approach to improve weight loss and reduce metabolic complications in overweight and obese subjects due to modifications of the microbiota composition and function. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses addressing similar questions revealed discordant evidence and/or are outdated. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar, and forward and backward citations for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with isolated soluble dietary fibre supplementation for at least 12 weeks in overweight and obese patients measuring body weight, published through April 2022. We expressed the results as mean differences (MDs) using the random-effects model of the metafor package in R and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB2 tool. We conducted the study according to the PRISMA guidelines and registered the protocol on PROSPERO (CRD42022295246). The participants with dietary fibre supplementation showed a significantly higher reduction in body weight (MD -1.25 kg, 95% CI -2.24, -0.25; 27 RCTs; 1428 participants) accompanied by a significant decrease in BMI, waist circumference, fasting blood insulin, and HOMA-IR compared to the control group.

35805748,Prevention of Loss of Muscle Mass and Function in Older Adults during COVID-19 Lockdown: Potential Role of Dietary Essential Amino Acids.,"As the COVID-19 pandemic became a global emergency, social distancing, quarantine, and limitations in outdoor activities have resulted in an environment of enforced physical inactivity (EPI). A prolonged period of EPI in older individuals accelerates the deterioration of skeletal muscle health, including loss of muscle mass and function, commonly referred to as sarcopenia. Sarcopenia is associated with an increased likelihood of the progression of diabetes, obesity, and/or depression. Well-known approaches to mitigate the symptoms of sarcopenia include participation in resistance exercise training and/or intake of balanced essential amino acids (EAAs) and high-quality (i.e., containing high EEAs) protein. As the pandemic situation discourages physical exercise, nutritional approaches, especially dietary EAA intake, could be a good alternative for counteracting against EPI-promoted loss of muscle mass and function. Therefore, in the present review, we cover (1) the impact of EPI-induced muscle loss and function on health, (2) the therapeutic potential of dietary EAAs for muscle health (e.g., muscle mass and function) in the EPI condition in comparison with protein sources, and finally (3) practical guidelines of dietary EAA intake for optimal anabolic response in EPI.",Park S; Chang Y; Wolfe RR; Kim IY,International journal of environmental research and public health,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35805748/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The edible plant materials containing α-spinasterol include spinach leaves, cucumber fruits, seeds of pumpkin and watermelon, argan seed oil, cactus pear seed oil and Amaranthus sp. It is a bioavailable nutraceutical, and it can cross the blood-brain barrier. It possesses several important pharmacological properties such as anti-diabetes mellitus, antiinflammation, hypolipidemic, antiulcer, neuroprotection, anti-pain and antitumour activities. For this review, literature search was made focusing on the pharmacological properties of α-spinasterol using PubMed and Google Scholar data bases. Recent studies show the promising antidiabetic properties of α-spinasterol. Its anti-diabetic mechanisms include enhancement of insulin secretion, reduction in insulin resistance, anti-diabetic nephropathy, increase in glucose uptake in muscle cells and inhibition of glucose absorption from intestine. Besides, it is a safe antiinflammatory agent, and its antiinflammatory mechanisms include inhibition of cyclooxygenases, antagonism of TRPV1 receptor and attenuation of proinflammatory cytokines and mediators. It is a promising and safe nutraceutical molecule for human health care. Food supplements, value-added products and nutraceutical formulations can be developed with α-spinasterol for the management of diabetes, chronic inflammatory diseases and improving general health.

Several studies have evaluated the effect of omega-3 FAs and vitamin E co-supplementation on obesity indices; however, the results are inconsistent. The present systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to address the role of omega-3 FAs plus vitamin E on obesity indices. <i>Methods:</i> Cochrane Library, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched up to February 2022. Among all of the qualified studies, 10 articles were selected. The effect size was presented as weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Fixed-effects model was employed to perform meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis and publication bias assessment were carried out. <i>Results:</i> Ten eligible randomized controlled trials comprising 558 participants were included. The average dose of omega-3 FAs and vitamin E co-supplementation in studies was 1000-4000 mg/day and 400 IU, respectively. Intervention duration varied from 6 to 16 weeks. There was no significant effect of omega-3 and vitamin E co-supplementation on body weight (BW) (WMD=0.14 kg; 95% CI: -0.13 to 0.42; p=0.297), and body mass index (BMI) (WMD=0.08, 95% CI: -0.01 to 0.16, p=0.073). However, subgroup analysis showed that it might increase BMI in women over 50 years and if the intervention lasted more than 8 weeks. <i>Conclusion:</i> There was no significant impact of combined omega-3 FAs and vitamin E supplementation on BW and BMI; however, it should be noted that the intervention has an increasing impact when supplementation duration was >8 weeks and in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus, >50 years old, and BMI>25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.",Musazadeh V; Tandorost A; Zarezadeh M; Jafarzadeh J; Ghavami Z; Jamilian P; Ostadrahimi A,International journal for vitamin and nutrition research.

Due to the current controversy about WP effects and mechanisms of its action on glycemic control, we conducted this systematic review to shed light on the subject. Web of Science, Medline (Pubmed), and Scopus online databases were searched from 2012 up to February 2022 using the following keywords: ""whey protein"" and ""glycemic control""/""glycemia""/""glucose""/""insulin"". The search included original English articles, human clinical trials with WP supplementation and measurement of glucose or insulin as an outcome, studies on healthy individuals/patients with diabetes mellitus (DM)/impaired fasting glucose (IFG). Title/abstract of 1991 studies were reviewed. After excluding studies due to inappropriate full title and duplication, and exercising inclusion criteria, 58 studies were reviewed in detail. Ample evidence showed that WP decreased postprandial glucose incremental area under the curve (iAUC) and increased iAUCs of insulin and incretin hormones. WP affects glycemic control mainly through stimulating insulin and incretins secretion, slowing gastric emptying, and appetite suppression.

35757617,Vitamin D: A Potential Mitigation Tool for the Endemic Stage of the COVID-19 Pandemic?,"The impact of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and associated development of clinical symptoms of COVID-19 have presented an enormous global impact on our health care systems, public health and economy. To date several observational epidemiological studies consistently found that vitamin D deficiency, measured as low levels of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D, is associated with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, certain cancers, autoimmune diseases and many infectious diseases, including acute respiratory infections. Since vitamin D is not merely immunosuppressive but also acts as an immunomodulator in tolerance and homeostasis, many experts have considered a role of vitamin D in the prevalence and severity of immune mediated inflammatory diseases, such as SARS-CoV-2, adding to the evidence of the importance of vitamin D in the immune response against viral respiratory infections and reinforcing the need for targeted vitamin D supplementation, with a focus on high-risk populations and a high-dose supplementation treatment for COVID-19 hospitalized patients. The expected transition to endemicity of SARS-CoV-2 even further corroborates as a potential of vitamin D as an potential mitigation tool for the prevention of COVID-19. The aim of this paper is to analyse the current evidence regarding vitamin D and present a hypothesis of its potential role in the current COVID-19 pandemic and in the future as a potential preventive measurement in public health.",Briceno Noriega D; Savelkoul HFJ,Frontiers in public health,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35757617/,1,0,0,0,0,0

A systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane library. A random-effect model was applied to estimate the weighted mean difference and 95% CI for each outcome. Overall, 20 eligible RCTs were included. Meta-analyses revealed that ginseng supplementation significantly reduced serum concentration of FPG, TC, IL-6, and HOMA-IR values. It also increased HR and TNF-α levels. Ginseng supplementation changed HOMA-IR and HDL-C significantly based on dose and changed HOMA-IR and LDL-C significantly based on study duration in a non-linear fashion. Furthermore, meta-regression analyses indicated a linear relationship between ginseng dose and absolute changes in HDL-C.

35680009,"Beneficial effects of probiotic and synbiotic supplementation on some cardiovascular risk factors among individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus: A grade-assessed systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression of randomized clinical trials.","Previous studies suggested that probiotics/synbiotics administration exerts some beneficial effects on cardiometabolic risk factors. However, the results from trials have been inconsistent. This study aimed to identify the impact of probiotic and synbiotic supplements on cardiovascular health factors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and prediabetes We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Scopus up to February 2022 to identify eligible RCTs. Estimating 95 % confidence (CI) and the weighted mean difference (WMD) for weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumferences (WC), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), the random-effects model was used. In the current meta-analysis, 54 RCTs were included. With the probiotic/synbiotics intervention, several parameters changed significantly, including weight (WMD: -0.38, 95 % CI: -0.63 to -0.12 Kg), TG (WMD: -19.08, 95 % CI: -27.65 to -10.51 mg/dl), TC (WMD: -10.46, 95 % CI: -15.19 to -5.72 mg/dl), LDL-C (WMD: -4.87, 95 % CI: -7.65 to -2.09 mg/dl), HDL-C (WMD: -2.70, 95 % CI: 1.33-4.07 mg/dl), SBP (WMD: -3.81, 95 % CI: -6.24 to -1.38 mmHg), and DBP (WMD: -2.01, 95 % CI: -3.12 to -0.91 mmHg). In the subgroup analysis, probiotics/synbiotics supplementation resulted in a greater change in lipid profile components in T2DM patients. Weight and BMI reduced only after synbiotic supplementation.

However, the effect of supplementation of this fatty acid profile on the telomere length and the telomerase enzyme activity was not revised yet. The PubMed and Embase® databases were used to search for clinical trials. A total of six clinical trials were revised. Omega-3 PUFA supplementation did not statistically affect telomere length in three out of three studies but affected telomerase activity in two out of four studies. The supplementation increased telomerase enzyme activity in subjects with first-episode schizophrenia. Besides, it decreased telomerase enzyme activity without modulating the effects of Pro12Ala polymorphism on the PPARγ gene in type 2 diabetes subjects. The methodological differences between the studies and the limited number of studies on the theme suggest that further studies are needed to elucidate the effects of n-3 PUFA supplementation on telomere length and telomerase enzyme activity in humans.",da Silva A; Silveira BKS; Hermsdorff HHM; da Silva W; Bressan J,"Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35661999/,0,1,0,0,0,0
35659730,Olfactory dysfunction in type II diabetes: Therapeutic options and lessons learned from other etiologies - A scoping review.,"Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is highly prevalent amongst type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) patients and has many associated health risks. For example, OD can lead to poor nutrition, safety issues related to diminished hazard detection, and increased mortality rates. While limited research exists about therapeutics for DM2-associated OD, recovery of olfactory function is better studied in other pathologic states. The objectives of this scoping review are to synthesize the existing data on interventions for DM2-associated OD and present the evidence for therapies that have been utilized for non-DM2-associated causes of OD. Additionally, the potential therapeutic opportunities for patients with DM2 are explored. A scoping review was conducted with a medical librarian to identify studies investigating treatments of DM2-related OD. 6 databases were searched (Embase, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, OVID Medline, and Web of Science). Studies were eligible if the primary discussion involved treatment of olfactory deficits in the context of DM2. All publication dates were included, and studies published in languages other than English were excluded. 3631 articles were identified; 3 articles met inclusion criteria and underwent full text review. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO), the DPP-4 inhibitor Linagliptin and the GLP-1 agonists Exenatide and Liraglutide are the only therapeutics that have been used in the context of DM2. Only HBO and GLP-1 agonists produced statistically significant improvements in olfactory identification. The literature regarding non-DM2-associated OD supports interventions such as olfactory training, dietary supplements, and intranasal insulin. Specifically, olfactory training was very effective in many contexts such as post-viral and traumatic OD while being affordable and non-invasive. This scoping review of olfactory rehabilitation options for DM2-induced OD demonstrates a paucity of prospective investigations of plausible therapeutics. Additionally, treatments for OD related to non-DM2-associated etiologies, such as olfactory training, are well-studied, efficacious, and should be investigated in the context of DM2. Future investigation has the potential to enhance the quality of clinical intervention for OD and improve short- and long-term outcomes for DM2 patients.",Sivakumar R; White J; Villwock J,Primary care diabetes,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35659730/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Numerous such seed oils serve as nutritional and functional supplements, making them a point of interest for scholars. Bitter gourd (<i>Momordica charantia</i> L.) seed oil (BGSO) has been widely used in folk medicine worldwide for the treatment of different pathologies, such as diabetes, cancer, and several inflammatory diseases. Therefore, its nutritional and medicinal value has been extensively studied. Considering the potential use of BGSO, it is imperative to have a comprehensive understanding of this product to develop and use its biologically active ingredients in innovative food and pharmaceutical products. An extensive understanding of BGSO would also help improve the economic feasibility of the bitter gourd seed processing industry and help prevent environmental pollution associated with the raw waste produced during the processing of bitter gourd seeds.

35605541,Whey protein supplementation improves postprandial glycemia in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Whey protein (WP) can increase insulin secretion, produce an incretin effect, delay gastric emptying, and regulate appetite, resulting in improved glycemic control. We hypothesized that WP supplementation is associated with postprandial glycemia regulation in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and conducted a quantitative meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to test this hypothesis. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus databases, and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry for relevant RCTs published before March 2022. We assessed the pooled effects using a random-effects model on glucose and insulin levels at 60 and 120 minutes, total glucagon-like peptide-1 (tGLP-1) at 30 and 60 minutes, and the incremental area under the curve (iAUC) of glucose, insulin, tGLP-1, and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide. Five RCTs involving 134 persons were included. Postprandial glycemia was significantly lower at 60 minutes (weighted mean difference: -2.67 mmol/L; 95% confidence interval, -3.62 to -1.72 mmol/L) and 120 minutes (-1.59 mmol/L; -2.91 to -0.28 mmol/L) in WP group than in placebo group. The iAUC of insulin was significantly higher in WP group (24.66 nmol/L × min, 1.65-47.66 nmol/L × min) than in placebo group. Although other results favored the WP group, differences between the groups were not statistically significant. The present study showed that premeal WP supplementation is beneficial for postprandial glycemia in persons with mild or well-controlled T2DM without substantial adverse effects. However, the level of certainty of current evidence is not high enough. Further larger and well-designed clinical trials are warranted for evaluating optimal dose and long-term effects of WP supplementation.",Chiang SW; Liu HW; Loh EW; Tam KW; Wang JY; Huang WL; Kuan YC,"Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35605541/,0,1,0,1,0,0

Beyond its classical function as a regulator of calcium and phosphate metabolism, together with its fundamental role in bone health in every stage of life, its deficiency has been associated to multiple adverse health effects. The classic effects of VD deficiency in pregnancy and neonates have been late hypocalcemia and nutritional rickets. Nevertheless, recent studies have linked VD to fertility and 25(OH)D with several clinical conditions in pregnancy: preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, higher incidence of cesarean section and preterm birth, while in infants, the clinical conditions are low birth weight, lower bone mass and possible relationship with the development of such diseases as bronchiolitis, asthma, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis and autism included as VD non-classical actions.

Despite lack of evidence, up to a third of adults consume Omega-3 supplements. No review has yet been published to report effect on depression in this cardiometabolic population. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of double-blinded, controlled randomised trials to investigate the safety and effect of Omega-3 supplementation on depression scores in people with cardiometabolic diseases. Primary outcome was change in depression scores versus placebo. Secondary outcomes were side-effects, concurrent medication and adherence. Results: Seven trials reporting on 2575 (672 female) adults aged 39−73 were included. Omega-3 dosages ranged from 1−3 g with an intervention duration of 10−48 weeks. Six out of seven trials found no statistically or clinically significant change to depression scores compared to placebo. One trial favoured intervention (Relative Risk Reduction: 47.93%, 95% CI: 24.89−63.98%, p < 0.001). Sub-analyses showed clinically meaningful reductions in depression scores for those on antidepressants (Intervention: 20.9 (SD: 7.1), Placebo: 24.9 (SD: 8.5) p < 0.05) or with severe depression (−1.74; 95% CI −3.04 to −0.05, p < 0.05) in two separate trials.

35565754,Dietary Supplements for Weight Management: A Narrative Review of Safety and Metabolic Health Benefits.,"Dietary supplements for weight management include myriad ingredients with thermogenic, lipotropic, satiety, and other metabolic effects. Recently, the safety of this product category has been questioned. In this review, we summarize the safety evidence as well as relevant clinical findings on weight management and metabolic effects of six representative dietary supplement ingredients: caffeine, green tea extract (GTE), green coffee bean extract (GCBE), choline, glucomannan, and capsaicinoids and capsinoids. Of these, caffeine, GTE (specifically epigallocatechin gallate [EGCG]), and choline have recommended intake limits, which appear not to be exceeded when used according to manufacturers' instructions. Serious adverse events from supplements with these ingredients are rare and typically involve unusually high intakes. As with any dietary component, the potential for gastrointestinal intolerance, as well as possible interactions with concomitant medications/supplements exist, and the health status of the consumer should be considered when consuming these components. Most of the ingredients reviewed also improved markers of metabolic health, such as glucose, lipids, and blood pressure, although the data are limited for some. In summary, weight management supplements containing caffeine, GTE, GCBE, choline, glucomannan, and capsaicinoids and capsinoids are generally safe when taken as directed and demonstrate metabolic health benefits for overweight and obese people.",Mah E; Chen O; Liska DJ; Blumberg JB,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35565754/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35546761,Probiotics as an Adjuvant for Management of Gastrointestinal Cancers through their Anti-inflammatory Effects: A Mechanistic Review.,"The immune system's role in maintaining the health of the gastrointestinal (GI) system is like a double-edged sword. Simultaneously, it could reduce the risk of pathogen invasion by the inflammatory response. However, if regulated improperly, it could also propagate oncogenic signaling that transfers a normal cell into the malignant counterpart. Thus, several mechanisms have been proposed, such as the immune system could disturb the GI homeostasis and increase the survival and proliferative capacity of cells, leading to the formation of a wide range of malignancies. Among the endless list of these mechanisms, inflammatory responses are currently fascinating research areas, as this response regulation is by the gut microbiota. Given this, microbiota manipulation might be a convenient and efficient way to prevent GI cancer. Probiotics could potentially achieve this by overturning the milieu in favor of normal gut homeostasis. In addition to the safety of the use of probiotics, along with their potential ability to interact with immune system responses, these bacteria are also being analyzed from the perspective of dietary supplements. In the present review, we aimed to look into the mechanisms through which probiotics modulate immune response to stimulate anti-inflammatory responses and promote immune surveillance against neoplastic cells.",Javid H; Karimi-Shahri M; Khorramdel M; Mashhad AS; Tabrizi AT; Sathyapalan T; Afshari AR; Sahebkar A,Current medicinal chemistry,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35546761/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35503258,Molecular modeling of lactoferrin for food and nutraceutical applications: insights from <i>in silico</i> techniques.,"Lactoferrin is a protein, primarily found in milk that has attracted the interest of the food industries due to its health properties. Nevertheless, the instability of lactoferrin has limited its commercial application. Recent studies have focused on encapsulation to enhance the stability of lactoferrin. However, the molecular insights underlying the changes of structural properties of lactoferrin and the interaction with protectants remain poorly understood. Computational approaches have proven useful in understanding the structural properties of molecules and the key binding with other constituents. In this review, comprehensive information on the structure and function of lactoferrin and the binding with various molecules for food purposes are reviewed, with a special emphasis on the use of molecular dynamics simulations. The results demonstrate the application of modeling and simulations to determine key residues of lactoferrin responsible for its stability and interactions with other biomolecular components under various conditions, which are also associated with its functional benefits. These have also been extended into the potential creation of enhanced lactoferrin for commercial purposes.

The decrease of both the intake of carbohydrates and their assimilation are among the main dietary strategies to counter these conditions. α-Amylase, a key enzyme involved in the digestion of carbohydrates, is the target enzyme to reduce the absorption rate of carbohydrates. α-Amylase inhibitors (α-AIs) can be found in plants. The common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris is of particular interest due to the presence of protein-based α-AIs which, through a protein-protein interaction, reduce the activity of this enzyme. Here we describe the nature of the various types of common bean seed extracts, the type of protein inhibitors they contain, reviewing the recent Literature about their molecular structure and mechanism of action. We also explore the existing evidence (clinical trials conducted on both animals and humans) supporting the potential benefits of this protein inhibitors from P. vulgaris, also highlighting the urgent need of further studies to confirm the clinical efficacy of the commercial products.

35458173,Do B Vitamins Enhance the Effect of <i>Omega</i>-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids on Cardiovascular Diseases? A Systematic Review of Clinical Trials.,"Studies have suggested that B vitamins or <i>omega</i>-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may deter the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This systematic review aims to examine whether the combined supplementation of both B vitamins and <i>omega</i>-3 PUFAs could provide additional beneficial effects to prevent CVD beyond the effect of each supplement based on clinical trials published up to December 2021. The overall findings are inconsistent and inconclusive, yet the combined supplementation of these two nutrients may be more effective at reducing plasma homocysteine, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol than the individual components. The underlying mechanisms mainly include alleviating endothelial dysfunction, inhibiting atherosclerosis and lesion initiation, reducing oxidative stress, suppressing activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, regulating endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and interfering with methylation of genes that promote atherogenesis. Although biologically plausible, the existing literature is insufficient to draw any firm conclusion regarding whether B vitamins can further enhance the potential beneficial effects of <i>omega</i>-3 PUFA intake on either primary or secondary prevention of CVD. The inconsistent findings may be largely explained by the methodological challenges. Therefore, well-designed high-quality trials that will use the combined supplementation of B vitamins and <i>omega</i>-3 PUFAs or dietary patterns rich in these two types of nutrients are warranted.",Zhu J; Xun PC; Kolencik M; Yang KF; Fly AD; Kahe K,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35458173/,0,1,0,0,0,0

35456919,Nutraceutical Concepts and Dextrin-Based Delivery Systems.,"Nutraceuticals are bioactive or chemical compounds acclaimed for their valuable biological activities and health-promoting effects. The global community is faced with many health concerns such as cancers, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, arthritis, osteoporosis, etc. The effect of nutraceuticals is similar to pharmaceuticals, even though the term nutraceutical has no regulatory definition. The usage of nutraceuticals, to prevent and treat the aforementioned diseases, is limited by several features such as poor water solubility, low bioavailability, low stability, low permeability, low efficacy, etc. These downsides can be overcome by the application of the field of nanotechnology manipulating the properties and structures of materials at the nanometer scale. In this review, the linear and cyclic dextrin, formed during the enzymatic degradation of starch, are highlighted as highly promising nanomaterials- based drug delivery systems. The modified cyclic dextrin, cyclodextrin (CD)-based nanosponges (NSs), are well-known delivery systems of several nutraceuticals such as quercetin, curcumin, resveratrol, thyme essential oil, melatonin, and appear as a more advanced drug delivery system than modified linear dextrin. CD-based NSs prolong and control the nutraceuticals release, and display higher biocompatibility, stability, and solubility of poorly water-soluble nutraceuticals than the CD-inclusion complexes, or uncomplexed nutraceuticals. In addition, the well-explored CD-based NSs pathways, as drug delivery systems, are described. Although important progress is made in drug delivery, all the findings will serve as a source for the use of CD-based nanosystems for nutraceutical delivery. To sum up, our review introduces the extensive literature about the nutraceutical concepts, synthesis, characterization, and applications of the CD-based nano delivery systems that will further contribute to the nutraceutical delivery with more potent nanosystems based on linear dextrins.",Hoti G; Matencio A; Rubin Pedrazzo A; Cecone C; Appleton SL; Khazaei Monfared Y; Caldera F; Trotta F,International journal of molecular sciences,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35456919/,1,0,0,0,0,0

35426325,Dietary supplements and bariatric surgery.,"Bariatric surgery or weight loss surgery has been in practice for achieving significant weight loss in patients who have failed to achieve weight loss after pharmacological interventions. The rising cases of obesity are a triggering factor for more bariatric surgeries worldwide. Interestingly, sustained weight loss achieved post-bariatric surgery offers metabolic advantages, and patients show improved glucose and lipid metabolisms. Bariatric surgery is directly linked to higher incidences of vitamin, mineral, and trace element deficiencies, thus making patients susceptible to anemia, osteoporosis, and cardiomyopathy. Reduced nutrient absorption capacity, dietary changes, dietary restriction, and altered gastrointestinal tract morphology are some reasons for nutritional deficiency observed in post-bariatric surgery procedures. Micro-and-macronutrient deficiency observed in patients during the postoperative phase requires continuous monitoring of nutritional parameters. Therefore, adequate multivitamin and mineral supplements become essential to prevent/overcome micronutrient deficiencies.

35409389,Benefits and Implications of Resveratrol Supplementation on Microbiota Modulations: A Systematic Review of the Literature.,"Resveratrol is a polyphenol that has been shown to possess many applications in different fields of medicine. This systematic review has drawn attention to the axis between resveratrol and human microbiota, which plays a key role in maintaining an adequate immune response that can lead to different diseases when compromised. Resveratrol can also be an asset in new technologies, such as gene therapy. PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched to find papers that matched our topic dating from 1 January 2017 up to 18 January 2022, with English-language restriction using the following Boolean keywords: (""resveratrol"" AND ""microbio*""). Eighteen studies were included as relevant papers matching the purpose of our investigation. Immune response, prevention of thrombotic complications, microbiota, gene therapy, and bone regeneration were retrieved as the main topics. The analyzed studies mostly involved resveratrol supplementation and its effects on human microbiota by trials in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo. The beneficial activity of resveratrol is evident by analyzing the changes in the host's genetic expression and the gastrointestinal microbial community with its administration. The possibility of identifying individual microbial families may allow to tailor therapeutic plans with targeted polyphenolic diets when associated with microbial dysbiosis, such as inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, degenerative diseases, tumors, obesity, diabetes, bone tissue regeneration, and metabolic syndrome.",Inchingolo AD; Malcangi G; Inchingolo AM; Piras F; Settanni V; Garofoli G; Palmieri G; Ceci S; Patano A; De Leonardis N; Di Pede C; Montenegro V; Azzollini D; Garibaldi MG; Kruti Z; Tarullo A; Coloccia G; Mancini A; Rapone B; Semjonova A; Hazballa D; D'Oria MT; Jones M; Macchia L; Bordea IR; Scarano A; Lorusso F; Tartaglia GM; Maspero C; Del Fabbro M; Nucci L; Ferati K; Ferati AB; Brienza N; Corriero A; Inchingolo F; Dipalma G,International journal of molecular sciences,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35409389/,0,1,0,0,0,0
35406067,Therapeutic Properties and Use of Extra Virgin Olive Oil in Clinical Nutrition: A Narrative Review and Literature Update.,"Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is a cornerstone of the Mediterranean diet (MedD). In this narrative review, we synthesize and illustrate the various characteristics and clinical applications of EVOO and its components-such as oleic acid, hydroxytyrosol, and oleuropein-in the field of clinical nutrition and dietetics. The evidence is split into diet therapy, oleic acid-based enteral nutrition formulations and oral supplementation formulations, oleic acid-based parenteral nutrition, and nutraceutical supplementation of minor components of EVOO. EVOO has diverse beneficial health properties, and current evidence supports the use of whole EVOO in diet therapy and the supplementation of its minor components to improve cardiovascular health, lipoprotein metabolism, and diabetes mellitus in clinical nutrition. Nevertheless, more intervention studies in humans are needed to chisel specific recommendations for its therapeutic use through different formulations in other specific diseases and clinical populations.",Jiménez-Sánchez A; Martínez-Ortega AJ; Remón-Ruiz PJ; Piñar-Gutiérrez A; Pereira-Cunill JL; García-Luna PP,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35406067/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35393674,A critical evaluation of risk to reward ratio of quercetin supplementation for COVID-19 and associated comorbid conditions.,"The interim results of the large, multinational trials on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using a combination of antiviral drugs appear to have little to no effect on the 28-day mortality or the in-hospital course. Therefore, there is a still vivid interest in finding alternate re-purposed drugs and nutrition supplements, which can halt or slow the disease severity. We review here the multiple preclinical studies, partially supported by clinical evidence showing the quercetin's possible therapeutic/prophylaxis efficacy against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as well as comorbidities like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus, obesity, coagulopathy, and hypertension. Currently, 14 interventional clinical trials are underway assessing the efficacy of quercetin along with other antiviral drugs/nutritional supplements as prophylaxis/treatment option against COVID-19. The present review is tempting to suggest that, based on circumstantial scientific evidence and preliminary clinical data, the flavonoid quercetin can ameliorate COVID-19 infection and symptoms acting in concert on two parallel and independent paths: inhibiting key factors responsible for SARS-CoV-2 infections and mitigating the clinical manifestations of the disease in patients with comorbid conditions. Despite the broad therapeutic properties of quercetin, further high power randomized clinical trials are needed to firmly establish its clinical efficacy against COVID-19.",Pawar A; Russo M; Rani I; Goswami K; Russo GL; Pal A,Phytotherapy research : PTR,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35393674/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35380602,Effects of Exogenous Ketone Supplementation on Blood Glucose: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Recently developed ketone (monoester or salt) supplements acutely elevate blood β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) exogenously without prolonged periods of fasting or carbohydrate restriction. Previous (small-scale) studies have found a blood glucose-lowering effect of exogenous ketones. This study aimed to systematically review available evidence and conduct meta-analyses of studies reporting on exogenous ketones and blood glucose. We searched 6 electronic databases on 13 December 2021 for randomized and nonrandomized trials of any length that reported on the use of exogenous ketones. We calculated raw mean differences (MDs) in blood BHB and glucose in 2 main analyses: 1) after compared with before acute ingestion of exogenous ketones and 2) following acute ingestion of exogenous ketones compared with a comparator supplement. We pooled effect sizes using random-effects models and performed prespecified subgroup analyses to examine the effect of potential explanatory factors, including study population, exercise, blood BHB, and supplement type, dosing, and timing. Risk of bias was examined using Cochrane's risk-of-bias tools. Studies that could not be meta-analyzed were summarized narratively. Forty-three trials including 586 participants are summarized in this review. Following ingestion, exogenous ketones increased blood BHB (MD = 1.73 mM; 95% CI: 1.26, 2.21 mM; P < 0.001) and decreased mean blood glucose (MD = -0.54 mM; 95% CI: -0.68, -0.40 mM; P < 0.001). Similarly, when compared with placebo, blood BHB increased (MD = 1.98 mM; 95% CI: 1.52, 2.45 mM; P < 0.001) and blood glucose decreased (MD = -0.47 mM; 95% CI: -0.57, -0.36 mM; P < 0.001). Across both analyses, significantly greater effects were seen with ketone monoesters compared with salts (P < 0.001). The available evidence indicates that acute ingestion of exogenous ketones leads to increased blood BHB and decreased blood glucose. Limited evidence on prolonged ketone supplementation was found.",Falkenhain K; Daraei A; Forbes SC; Little JP,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35380602/,0,1,0,1,0,0
35356737,Exercise Interventions Combined With Dietary Supplements in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-A Systematic Review of Relevant Health Outcomes.,"Physical training can improve several health variables in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A growing body of studies also finds a positive influence of dietary supplement (DS) intake. The aim of this review is to shed light on the possible effects of training interventions combined with DS intake in T2DM patients. A systematic search was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines in the PubMed and BISp Surf databases. Inclusion criteria were defined using the Patient-Intervention-Comparison-Outcome (PICO) scheme. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale was used for quality assessment and risk of bias analysis. Ten controlled interventional studies with a total number of 643 subjects met the inclusion criteria. These studies investigated the effects of (a) vitamin D (VD), (b) VD + whey protein, (c) polyphenol containing antioxidant capsules, (d) creatine, (e) L-arginine, (f) leucine-rich amino acids, and (g) broccoli sprouts powder. Eight studies investigated effects on one or more of the following health outcomes: body mass index, fat mass, insulin resistance, glycemic control, lipid profile, oxidative stress/antioxidative capacity and/or inflammatory markers/molecules. Five of the studies show clear superior effects of physical training combined with DS intake (supplements a, b, c, e) on some of these variables compared with training only. However, one study indicates that VD intake might attenuate the training effects on triglyceride levels. Another study found that training + VD + whey protein intake increased tumor necrosis factor-α levels in T2DM patients. The effects of training combined with DS intake on renal function (supplement d) or incretin metabolism (supplement a) were investigated in two further studies. These studies do not show any additional effects of DS intake. The quality of the majority of the studies was high. DS intake can potentially increase the benefits of physical training for specific health outcomes in T2DM patients. However, negative effects can also be observed. Possible cellular and molecular mechanisms behind potential synergistic or divergent effects of exercise training and DS use in T2DM should be explored in detail in future studies for the development of safe recommendations.",Meuffels FM; Isenmann E; Strube M; Lesch A; Oberste M; Brinkmann C,Frontiers in nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35356737/,0,1,0,0,0,0
35334949,Taurine Supplementation as a Neuroprotective Strategy upon Brain Dysfunction in Metabolic Syndrome and Diabetes.,"Obesity, type 2 diabetes, and their associated comorbidities impact brain metabolism and function and constitute risk factors for cognitive impairment. Alterations to taurine homeostasis can impact a number of biological processes, such as osmolarity control, calcium homeostasis, and inhibitory neurotransmission, and have been reported in both metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders. Models of neurodegenerative disorders show reduced brain taurine concentrations. On the other hand, models of insulin-dependent diabetes, insulin resistance, and diet-induced obesity display taurine accumulation in the hippocampus. Given the possible cytoprotective actions of taurine, such cerebral accumulation of taurine might constitute a compensatory mechanism that attempts to prevent neurodegeneration. The present article provides an overview of brain taurine homeostasis and reviews the mechanisms by which taurine can afford neuroprotection in individuals with obesity and diabetes. We conclude that further research is needed for understanding taurine homeostasis in metabolic disorders with an impact on brain function.",Rafiee Z; García-Serrano AM; Duarte JMN,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35334949/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The aims of this systematic review were to assess the impact of nutritional intervention on markers of nutritional status in this complex patient group. A systematic review of EMBASE and PubMed was carried out in February 2020, identifying 2620 articles. After screening to exclude those reporting short term changes (less than 3 months), with only one data point, or in the wrong population, eight papers were selected for analysis. Seven studies documented the impact of a nutritional intervention, one was an observational study only. Overall, studies were limited by predominantly retrospective designs, heterogenous populations and poor control of potentially confounding variables. Data could not be combined due to variability in reporting methods. All studies exploring nutritional intervention, whether that consisted of advice by a specialist dietitian, dose escalation of pancreatic enzymes, oral nutritional supplements or enteral feeding, demonstrated improved body weight and pain control, whereas patients who did not receive an intervention deteriorated nutritionally. Patients with chronic pancreatitis benefit from nutritional intervention. Further work is required to explore the impact of nutritional intervention on body composition and functional outcomes.",Phillips ME; Robertson MD; Hart KH; Kumar R; Pencavel TD,Clinical nutrition ESPEN,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35331489/,0,1,0,0,0,0

PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other databases were searched from inception until October 2021. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the efficacy saffron supplementation on sleep quality were included. Data were extracted independently by 2 investigators and assessed the study quality by the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. The measurements include Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Restorative Sleep Questionnaire (RSQ). The pooling of the effect sizes showed that saffron group achieve a notable treatment effect on PSQI (MD: -2.14; 95% CI: -2.86 to -1.42; P < 0.01), ISI (MD: -2.63; 95% CI: -3.70 to -2.55; P < 0.01) and RSQ (MD: 7.05; 95% CI: 1.48 to 12.62; P = 0.01) compared with placebo group. Saffron supplementation as a treatment for improving sleep quality have promising clinical application as its great improvement on all efficacy outcomes and no serious adverse advents occurred as the dose was increased. The dose of 100 mg saffron supplementation per day was proved to achieve excellent and more stable curative effect on improving sleep quality in our subgroup analysis. However, further investigation is necessary to confirm the efficacy and long-term safety of different doses of saffron for insomnia.",Lian J; Zhong Y; Li H; Yang S; Wang J; Li X; Zhou X; Chen G,Sleep medicine,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35325766/,0,0,0,1,0,0
35307907,Antioxidant for treatment of diabetic complications: A meta-analysis and systematic review.,"Antioxidants may provide a complementary treatment for patients with chronic diseases. Nevertheless, studies that have measured the effects of antioxidant on diabetes complications have provided conflicting results. This study aimed to elucidate the association between antioxidant and diabetic complications and to develop robust evidence for clinical decisions by systematic reviews and meta-analysis. PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus databases were searched to collect clinical studies related to the efficacy of antioxidants in the treatment of diabetes complications from inception to May 5, 2021. Statistical meta-analyses were performed using the RevMan 5.4 software. Stata16 software was used to detect publication bias. The data of diabetic nephropathy (DN), diabetic nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and diabetic periodontitis were collected to analyze the effect of antioxidant on diabetes and the above three complications. The meta-analysis results showed that antioxidant treatment was associated with significantly changes in the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (standardized mean difference [SMD]: - 0.21 [95% confidence interval [CI]: - 0.33, -0.10], p < 0.001), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (MD: - 0.41 [95% CI: - 0.63, -0.18], p < 0.001), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (SMD: 0.44 [95% CI: 0.24, 0.63], p < 0.001) and malondialdehyde (MDA) (SMD: - 0.82 [95% CI: - 1.24, -0.41], p < 0.001) than the control group. Antioxidant supplements have the potential to treat three complications of diabetes.

35304727,Could nutrient supplements provide additional glycemic control in diabetes management? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of as an add-on nutritional supplementation therapy.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the antidiabetic effect of pharmaconutrients as an add-on in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients by pooling data from currently available randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Data sources included the PubMed and EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. RCTs reporting changes in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose (FBG), or homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) levels following add-on pharmaconutritional therapies for T2DM patients consuming antidiabetic drugs were targeted. Using random-effects meta-analyses, we identified pharmaconutrients with effects on glycemic outcomes. Heterogeneity among studies was presented using I<sup>2</sup> values. Among 9537 articles, 119 RCTs with nine pharmaconutrients (chromium; coenzyme Q10; omega-3 fatty acids; vitamins C, D, and E; alpha-lipoic acid; selenium; and zinc) were included. Chromium (HbA1c, FBG, and HOMA-IR), coenzyme Q10 (HbA1c and FBG), vitamin C (HbA1c and FBG), and vitamin E (HbA1c and HOMA-IR) significantly improved glycemic control. Baseline HbA1c level and study duration influenced the effects of chromium and vitamin E on HbA1c level. Sensitivity analyses did not modify the pooled effects of pharmaconutrients on glycemic control. Administration of chromium, coenzyme Q10, and vitamins C and E for T2DM significantly improved glycemic control.

35298104,[Regulatory role and anticarcinogenic properties of certain vitamins' active derivatives and vitamin-like substances].,"Vitamins are low-molecular compounds consisting of an essential part of the human diet. After entering the human organism vitamins or their precursors can undergo chemical modification, changing their biological properties and regulatory activity. For many decades, vitamins were considered mainly as precursors of enzyme cofactors, and hypovitaminosis was interpreted as a deficiency of a particular metabolite resulting from enzyme's insufficient activity. However, with the development of molecular biology techniques and breakthrough in understanding of gene expression regulation and cell signaling mechanisms, as well as in molecular mechanisms of diseases associated with impaired functions, it became clear that there are significantly more active forms of vitamins, and their functions in the human body are more diverse than it had been suggested previously. <b>The purpose</b> of this review was to consider vitamins' and vitamins' derivatives regulatory and anti-tumor role and their potential for clinical application as main or adjuvant drugs for malignant neoplasms treatment. <b>Material and methods</b>. The present review is based on the results of literature analysis conducted in the Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct databases for the keywords «vitamin A AND cancer», «retinoids AND cancer», «vitamin D AND cancer», «vitamins AND cancer», «vitamins AND cancer». The search depth was 6 years (2016-2021). <b>Results</b>. Active forms of hydrophilic and lipophilic vitamins are key participants in the processes of chromatin remodeling, genome stability maintaining, covalent modification of proteins, including signaling and regulatory ones, and also act as chemical messengers themselves. Therefore, vitamin deficiency is associated with autoimmune and chronic diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, etc. This review considers the regulatory role of active forms of vitamins, their derivatives and vitamin-like substances as well as their involvement in the process of carcinogenesis. <b>Conclusions</b>. Modern studies confirm the high therapeutic potential of vitamins: the use of pharmacological doses of vitamins or their derivatives may help to prevent or fight non-communicable diseases, including cancer.",Zabolotneva AA; Shatova OP; Mikin IE; Bril DV; Rоumiantsev SA,Voprosy pitaniia,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35298104/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35276964,"Nutraceuticals for Dyslipidaemia and Glucometabolic Diseases: What the Guidelines Tell Us (and Do Not Tell, Yet).","The use of nutraceutical products and functional foods in the cardiovascular and metabolic field is rising in several countries. Preparation and implementation of guidelines are pivotal for translating research-derived knowledge and evidence-based medicine to the clinical practice. Based on these considerations, the aim of this paper is to explore if and how nutraceutical products are discussed by the most recent international guidelines related to cardio-metabolic diseases (dyslipidaemia, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention). Some, but not all, guidelines for dyslipidaemia mention nutraceutical products as potential useful options for the treatment of mild dyslipidaemia, but also indicate the low level of evidence associated to their effects on hard endpoints (myocardial infarction, stroke, CVD-related death). In the most recent guidelines on obesity, it is mentioned that no safe and effective dietary supplement nor nutraceutical product is available for the management of weight loss in this condition, and more high-quality studies are necessary in this field. The examined guidelines for T2DM do not mention any specific nutraceutical approach to this disease, nor to milder forms, such as insulin resistance and pre-diabetes. The focus on nutraceutical products in the main international guidelines for cardio-metabolic disease management remains limited. Since robust scientific evidence is the background of useful and effective guidelines, the implementation of high-quality clinical research is strongly needed in the field of nutraceutical products for cardio-metabolic diseases.",Casula M; Catapano AL; Magni P,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35276964/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35276849,Modulatory Properties of Food and Nutraceutical Components Targeting NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation.,"Inflammasomes are key intracellular multimeric proteins able to initiate the cellular inflammatory signaling pathway. NLRP3 inflammasome represents one of the main protein complexes involved in the development of inflammatory events, and its activity has been largely demonstrated to be connected with inflammatory or autoinflammatory disorders, including diabetes, gouty arthritis, liver fibrosis, Alzheimer's disease, respiratory syndromes, atherosclerosis, and cancer initiation. In recent years, it has been demonstrated how dietary intake and nutritional status represent important environmental elements that can modulate metabolic inflammation, since food matrices are an important source of several bioactive compounds. In this review, an updated status of knowledge regarding food bioactive compounds as NLRP3 inflammasome modulators is discussed. Several chemical classes, namely polyphenols, organosulfurs, terpenes, fatty acids, proteins, amino acids, saponins, sterols, polysaccharides, carotenoids, vitamins, and probiotics, have been shown to possess NLRP3 inflammasome-modulating activity through in vitro and in vivo assays, mainly demonstrating an anti-NLRP3 inflammasome activity. Plant foods are particularly rich in important bioactive compounds, each of them can have different effects on the pathway of inflammatory response, confirming the importance of the nutritional pattern (food model) as a whole rather than any single nutrient or functional compound.",Spano M; Di Matteo G; Ingallina C; Ambroselli D; Carradori S; Gallorini M; Giusti AM; Salvo A; Grosso M; Mannina L,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35276849/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Several databases for peer-reviewed articles were systematically searched to identify studies reporting outcomes associated with the effects of a low-protein diet (LPD) or very-low protein diet (VLPD) in combination with supplemental KA in adults with DKD. Meta-analyses were conducted when feasible. Of 213 identified articles, 11 could be included in the systematic review. Meta-analyses for renal outcomes (4 studies examining glomerular filtration rate; 5 studies examining 24-h urinary protein excretion), metabolic outcomes (5 studies examining serum urea; 7 studies examining blood glucose), clinical outcomes (6 studies examining blood pressure; 4 studies examining hemoglobin), and nutritional outcomes (3 studies examining serum albumin; 4 studies examining body weight) were all in favor of KA use in DKD patients. Data from individual studies that examined other related parameters also tended to show favorable effects from KA-supplemented LPD/VLPD. The regimens were safe and well tolerated, with no evidence of adverse effects on nutritional status. In conclusion, LPD/VLPD supplemented with KA could be considered effective and safe for patients with non-dialysis dependent DKD.

35236261,Beyond its Psychiatric Use: The Benefits of Low-dose Lithium Supplementation.,"Lithium is most well-known for its mood-stabilizing effects in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Due to its narrow therapeutic window (0.5-1.2 mM serum concentration), there is a stigma associated with lithium treatment and the adverse effects that can occur at therapeutic doses. However, several studies have indicated that doses of lithium under the predetermined therapeutic dose used in bipolar disorder treatment may have beneficial effects not only in the brain but across the body. Currently, literature shows that low-dose lithium (≤0.5 mM) may be beneficial for cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, metabolic, and cognitive function, as well as inflammatory and antioxidant processes of the aging body. There is also some evidence of low-dose lithium exerting a similar and sometimes synergistic effect on these systems. This review summarizes these findings with a focus on low-dose lithium's potential benefits on the aging process and age-related diseases of these systems, such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, sarcopenia, obesity and type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and the chronic low-grade inflammatory state known as inflammaging. Although lithium's actions have been widely studied in the brain, the study of the potential benefits of lithium, particularly at a low dose, is still relatively novel.

35205044,Nutraceuticals in HIV and COVID-19-Related Neurological Complications: Opportunity to Use Extracellular Vesicles as Drug Delivery Modality.,"People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) are at an increased risk of severe and critical COVID-19 infection. There is a steady increase in neurological complications associated with COVID-19 infection, exacerbating HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) in PLWHA. Nutraceuticals, such as phytochemicals from medicinal plants and dietary supplements, have been used as adjunct therapies for many disease conditions, including viral infections. Appropriate use of these adjunct therapies with antiviral proprieties may be beneficial in treating and/or prophylaxis of neurological complications associated with these co-infections. However, most of these nutraceuticals have poor bioavailability and cannot cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To overcome this challenge, extracellular vesicles (EVs), biological nanovesicles, can be used. Due to their intrinsic features of biocompatibility, stability, and their ability to cross BBB, as well as inherent homing capabilities, EVs hold immense promise for therapeutic drug delivery to the brain. Therefore, in this review, we summarize the potential role of different nutraceuticals in reducing HIV- and COVID-19-associated neurological complications and the use of EVs as nutraceutical/drug delivery vehicles to treat HIV, COVID-19, and other brain disorders.",Kodidela S; Godse S; Kumar A; Nguyen XH; Cernasev A; Zhou L; Singh AK; Bhat HK; Kumar S,Biology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35205044/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35174689,Dietary supplements in therapy to support weight reduction in obese patients.,"Obesity is a pandemic disease that poses a serious problem for the entire world population. Preventative and non-pharmacological treatments for obesity include changing eating habits and increasing physical activity. The use of certain dietary supplements also brings beneficial results in the process of reducing excess body weight. There are many options for the treatment of obesity available on the pharmaceutical market. This study aims to review the latest publications on selected dietary supplements in the treatment of excess body weight. Dietary supplements which support a reduction in excess body weight include capsaicin, bitter orange, white bean seeds, green coffee, berberine, and single and multi-strain probiotics. Some of these supplements have additional health benefits. Bitter orange has antioxidant and anti-ulcer properties. Berberine improves lipid metabolism and reduces blood glucose levels. Capsaicin has found application in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Supplements that do not significantly reduce body weight are chitosan and vitamin D. Chitosan can reduce blood pressure, while vitamin D improves the sensitivity of tissue to insulin.

35164437,Nutraceuticals and peripheral glial cells: a possible link?,"A nutraceutical is a food-derived molecule that provides medical or health benefits beyond its basic nutritional role, including the prevention and treatment of disease and its symptoms. In the peripheral nervous system, satellite glial cells are found in close relationship with neurons, mainly in peripheral sensory ganglia, but, compared with other glial cells, the relationship between these cells and nutraceuticals has received little attention. After describing satellite glial cells and their role and changes in physiology and pathology, we review the studies on the effects of nutraceuticals as modulators of their functions. Maybe due to the difficulties in selectively labeling these cells, only a few studies, performed mainly in rodent models, have analyzed nutraceutical effects, showing that N-acetylcysteine, curcumin, quercetin, osthole and resveratrol may palliate neuropathic pain through satellite glial cells-dependent pathways, namely antioxidant mechanisms and/or interference with purinergic signaling. Neither other conditions in which satellite glial cells are involved (visceral pain, nerve regeneration) nor other nutraceuticals or mechanisms of action have been studied. Although more preclinical and clinical research is needed, the available reports support the general notion that nutraceuticals may become interesting alternatives in the prevention and/or treatment of peripheral gliopathies and their associated conditions, including those affecting the satellite glial cells.",Szymaszkiewicz A; López-Gómez L; Zielińska M; Abalo R,Journal of integrative neuroscience,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35164437/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35152860,N1-Methylnicotinamide: Is it Time to Consider it as a Dietary Supplement for Athletes?,"Exercise is considered to be a ""medicine"" due to its modulatory roles in metabolic disorders, such as diabetes and obesity. The intensity and duration of exercise determine the mechanism of energy production by various tissues of the body, especially by muscles, in which the requirement for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) increases by as much as 100-fold. Naturally, athletes try to improve their exercise performance by dietary supplementation with, e.g., vitamins, metabolites, and amino acids. MNAM, as a vitamin B3 metabolite, reduces serum levels and liver contents of triglycerides and cholesterol, and induces lipolysis. It stimulates gluconeogenesis and prohibits liver cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis through the expression of sirtuin1 (SIRT1). It seems that MNAM is not responsible for the actions of NNMT in the adipose tissues as MNAM inhibits the activity of NNMT in the adipose tissue and acts as an inhibitor of its activity.NNMT-MNAM axis is more activated in the muscles of individuals undergoing the high-volume-low-intensity exercise and caloric restriction. Therefore, MNAM could be an important myokine during exercise and fasting where it provides the required energy for muscles through the induction of lipolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver and adipose tissues, respectively. Increased levels of MNAM in exercise and fasting led us to propose that the consumption of MNAM during training, especially endurance training, could boost exercise capacity and improve performance. Therefore, in this review, we shed light on the potential of MNAM as a dietary supplement in sports medicine.",Nejabati HR; Ghaffari-Novin M; Fathi-Maroufi N; Faridvand Y; Holmberg HC; Hansson O; Nikanfar S; Nouri M,Current pharmaceutical design,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35152860/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35119572,Evaluation of hypoglycemic therapeutics and nutritional supplementation for type 2 diabetes mellitus management: An insight on molecular approaches.,"This review aims to summarize the current management of type 2 diabetes principles, including oral hypoglycemic agents, types of insulin administration, diet maintenance, and various molecular approaches. A literature search was conducted in different databases such as Scopus, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and Web of Science by using the following keywords: type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), first-line and second-line treatment, oral hypoglycemic agents, insulin administration, diet/nutritional therapy, gene and stem cell therapy, and diabetic complications. The first-line treatment of T2DM includes administering oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) and second-line treatment by insulin therapy and some OHAs like Sulfonylurea's (SU). The oral hypoglycemic or oral antidiabetic drugs have the function of lowering glucose in the blood. Insulin therapy is recommended for people with A1C levels > 7.0, and insulin administration is evolved drastically from the syringe, pump, pen, inhalation, insulin jet, and patch. The use of OHAs and insulin therapy during glycemic control has a severe effect on weight gain and other side effects. Hence, diet maintenance (macro and micronutrients) and nutritional therapy guidelines were also reviewed/recommended for safe T2DM management. Besides, the recent progress in molecular approaches that focuses on identifying new targets for T2DM (i.e.) consisting of gene therapy, stem cell therapy, and the modulation of insulin signaling pathways for the regulation of glucose storage and uptake also discussed. The analysis of all these key factors is necessary to develop a potential agent to cure T2DM and suggest that a combination of therapies will pave the way for advanced management of T2DM.",Prasathkumar M; Becky R; Anisha S; Dhrisya C; Sadhasivam S,Biotechnology letters,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35119572/,1,0,0,0,0,0

35105943,Effects of maternal folate and vitamin B12 on gestational diabetes mellitus: a dose-response meta-analysis of observational studies.,"To comprehensively estimate the association of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk with maternal red blood cell (RBC) folate, plasma/serum folate, dose and duration of folic acid supplement (FAS) intake and vitamin B12 separately. PubMed, Web of science, CNKI, and Wanfang Databases were searched through March 26, 2021. We synthesized data using random-effects model meta-analysis in Stata 12.0. Sensitivity, subgroup and dose-response analyses were also performed. The certainty of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE). Twenty six datasets from thirteen eligible observational studies were included in the study. We found a significant increase of GDM risk with the highest versus lowest category of RBC folate (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.48-2.61, I2 = 0.0%, moderate-certainty evidence) and plasma/serum folate (OR = 1.23, 1.02-1.48, I2 = 57.8%, low-certainty evidence). The dose-response analysis revealed that each 200 ng/ml increase in RBC folate was significantly associated with 8% higher GDM risk. No significant association between dose of FAS intake and GDM risk was found with very low cetainty. Meanwhile, longer duration (≥3 months) of FAS conferred 56% significant higher GDM risk (OR = 1.56, 1.02-2.39, very low certainty evidence). No significant association of GDM risk with highest plasma/serum B12 was observed compared to lowest B12 (OR = 0.77, 0.58-1.02, very low-certainty evidence). Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that higher RBC folate appears to significantly increase GDM risk. Higher plasma/serum folate may increase GDM risk but with low certainty.

Excessive intake of preformed vitamin A, such as that found in supplements and animal sources (animal liver, fish liver oil, dairy, and eggs), is associated with multisystem effects that can include bone resorption and hypercalcemia. Hence, vitamin A toxicity should be explored in unexplained cases of parathyroid hormone-independent hypercalcemia. Serum retinol levels can be helpful in the diagnosis, but the results must be interpreted with caution since they do not always reflect total body levels. Treatment involves supportive care and withdrawal of vitamin A sources, especially preformed ones.

We hypothesized the same effects of astaxanthin in humans and conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of previous randomized controlled trials to test this hypothesis. The literature search was performed on PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases from January 1970 to April 2021. Main eligibility criteria include: intervention using astaxanthin for at least 1 week; inclusion of placebo control; and measuring at least 1 of the common oxidative stress and inflammation biomarkers before and after intervention. Twelve randomized controlled trials including 380 participants were included. Compared with placebo, astaxanthin significantly reduced blood malondialdehyde concentration (standardized mean difference [SMD]: -0.95; 95% CI, -1.67 to -0.23; P = .01). The lowering effect of astaxanthin supplementation on malondialdehyde was particularly significant in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients (SMD: -0.64; 95% CI, -1.26 to -0.01; P < .05). A limited number of trials were available for the effects of astaxanthin on other oxidative stress biomarkers. Astaxanthin supplementation appeared to improve superoxide dismutase activity and reduce serum isoprostane concentration in overweight subjects. Astaxanthin significantly reduced blood interleukin-6 concentration in T2DM patients (weighted mean difference: -0.70 pg/mL; 95% CI, -1.29 to -0.11 pg/mL; P = .02). The effects of astaxanthin on blood C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor-α concentrations were not significant.

35081820,The effects of dietary supplements and natural products targeting glucose levels: an overview.,"Identifying effective dietary supplements and medicinal herbs has attracted the attention of clinicians and researchers to complement the standard treatment in controlling diabetes mellitus. In the present overview, we aimed to collect studies with the highest level of evidence to shed light on detecting the most effective dietary supplements and medicinal herbs for controlling glycemic status. For the current overview, four electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library, were systematically searched from inception to 31 December 2020 and then updated until 1 October 2021 to obtain eligible meta-analyses on either dietary supplements or medicinal herbs and their effects on glycemic status. Fasting blood sugar (FBS) and Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) were considered as primary outcomes. Finally, ninety-one meta-analyses on dietary supplements (<i>n</i> = 55) and herbs (<i>n</i> = 36) were included. Evidence showed positive effects of chromium, zinc, propolis, aloe vera, milk thistle, fenugreek, cinnamon, ginger, and nettle on FBS and/or HbA1C. However, mostly the heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup>) was high. Other supplements and herbs also showed no reduction in glucose levels or their effects were small. Although some dietary supplements and medicinal herbs showed a significant reduction in FBS and/or HbA1C, mostly their effects from the clinical point of view were not remarkable. In addition, due to high heterogeneity, publication bias, and a limited number of included studies in most cases further clinical trials are needed for making decision on anti-diabetic supplement efficacy.",Hekmat-Ardakani A; Morshed-Behbahani B; Rahimi-Ardabili H; Ayati MH; Namazi N,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35081820/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35074646,Distribution of oral nutritional supplements with medication: Is there a benefit? A systematic review.,"Disease-related malnutrition remains a major burden for patients and health care systems. The Medication Pass Nutritional Supplement Program (MEDPass) involves providing patients with oral nutritional supplements (ONS) in unusually small amounts three to four times per day during medication rounds. This systematic review aims to evaluate the impact of MEDPass ONS administration on compliance, total energy and protein intake, food intake, body weight and handgrip strength in hospitalized adults and nursing-home residents. We conducted a systematic literature search in the databases MEDLINE, Embase, ScienceDirect, and the Cochrane Library and included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCTs, and before-after studies. Validated tools specific to the study design were used to assess the included studies. Ten studies were identified, including two RCTs, three non-RCTs, and five before-after trials. Compliance increased by 23.4% to 66% with MEDPass administration, resulting in compliance rates of 72.7% to 96%. With MEDPass administration, body weight increased by 1% to 6.8% or remained stable. The assessed evidence on total energy intake is ambiguous for protein, with a trend toward an increased intake. Trials on energy intake from food show mixed results as well. One study suggested a slight increase in handgrip strength. The included studies predominantly raise concerns for bias. We conclude that MEDPass ONS administration increases compliance in hospitalized adults and nursing-home residents. For all other outcomes, robust and well-powered trials are necessary.",Krebs F; Uhlmann K; Stanga Z; Kurmann S,"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35074646/,0,1,0,0,0,0

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, until December 2020, in the following databases: Pubmed, Lilacs, Scielo, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane. It included experimental studies that investigated the effects of creatine supplementation on diabetes treatment or prevention and its relationship with fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance. Nine studies were included in the review, from which five showed some benefit of creatine supplementation in at least one diabetes parameter. In diabetic individuals (n = 2), creatine was beneficial. In the meta-analysis, there are no significant effect on fasting blood glucose [SMD: 0.05; CI95%: -0.53, 0.63; p = 0.28; I2 = 22%] and insulin resistance [SMD: -0.38; 95% CI: -0.90, 0.14; p = 0.22; I2 = 33%].

A Scoping Review.,"Maternal dietary micronutrients and omega-3 fatty acids support development of the fetal and neonatal immune system. Whether supplementation is similarly beneficial for the mother during gestation has received limited attention. A scoping review of human trials was conducted looking for evidence of biochemical, genomic, and clinical effects of supplementation on the maternal immune system. The authors explored the literature on PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases from 2010 to the present day using PRISMA-ScR methodology. Full-length human trials in English were searched for using general terms and vitamin A, B12, C, D, and E; choline; iodine; iron; selenium; zinc; and docosahexaenoic/eicosapentaenoic acid. Of 1391 unique articles, 36 were eligible for inclusion. Diverse biochemical and epigenomic effects of supplementation were identified that may influence innate and adaptive immunity. Possible clinical benefits were encountered in malaria, HIV infections, anemia, Type 1 diabetes mellitus, and preventing preterm delivery. Only limited publications were identified that directly explored maternal immunity in pregnancy and the effects of micronutrients. None provided a holistic perspective. It is concluded that supplementation may influence biochemical aspects of the maternal immune response and some clinical outcomes, but the evidence from this review is not sufficient to justify changes to current guidelines.",Rees G; Brough L; Orsatti GM; Lodge A; Walker S,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35057548/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Related articles were found by searching the PubMed, SCOPUS, Embase and Web of Science databases (from inception to 30 February 2020). A one-stage robust error meta-regression model based on inverse variance weighted least squares regression and cluster robust error variances was used for the dose-response analysis between Mg supplementation and duration of intervention and glycaemic control factors. Eighteen eligible randomised clinical trials were included in our final analysis. The dose-response testing indicated that the estimated mean difference in HbA1c at 500 mg/d was -0·73 % (95 % CI: -1·25, -0·22) suggesting modest improvement in HbA1c with strong evidence (<i>P</i> value: 0·004). And in fasting blood sugar (FBS) at 360 mg/d was -7·11 mg/dl (95 % CI: -14·03, -0·19) suggesting minimal amelioration in FBS with weak evidence (<i>P</i> value: 0·092) against the model hypothesis at this sample size.

However, they are conflicting. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to summarize earlier findings for the effect of ginger supplementation on metabolic profile in patients with T2DM. Scopus, PubMed and Google Scholar databases were systematically searched up until September 2021 to collect all randomized clinical trials that evaluated the effect of ginger supplementation on FBS, HbA<sub>1</sub>c, TC, TG, LDL, HDL, SBP and DBP in patients with T2DM. We conducted our study according to the 2020 PRISMA guidelines. We included only English language publications. Pooled effect sizes were measured using a random-effects model and were reported as the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% CI. In addition, the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool was used to evaluate quality of the trials. In overall, 10 articles were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Our pooled meta-analysis indicated a significant reduction in FBS following ginger supplementation by polling 8 effect sizes [weighted mean difference (WMD): - 18.81; 95% CI: - 28.70, - 8.92), I<sup>2</sup> = 77.4%] and in HbA<sub>1</sub>C through 7 effect sizes (WMD: -0.57; 95% CI: -0.93, -0.20, I<sup>2</sup> =88.6%).

In the present umbrella review we aimed to evaluate the effects of low vitamin D concentrations and vitamin D supplementation on multiple health outcomes. We summarized current evidence obtained from meta-analyses of observational studies that examined associations between vitamin D concentrations and multiple health outcomes, meta-analyses of RCTs that investigated the effect of vitamin D supplementation on multiple health outcomes, and MR studies that explored the causal associations of vitamin D concentrations with various diseases (international prospective register of systematic reviews PROSPERO registration number CRD42018091434). A total of 296 meta-analyses of observational studies comprising 111 unique outcomes, 139 meta-analyses of RCTs comprising 46 unique outcomes, and 73 MR studies comprising 43 unique outcomes were included in the present umbrella review. Twenty-eight disease outcomes were identified by both meta-analyses of observational studies and MR studies. Seventeen of these reported disease outcomes had consistent results, demonstrating that lower concentrations of vitamin D were associated with a higher risk for all-cause mortality, Alzheimer's disease, hypertension, schizophrenia, and type 2 diabetes. The combinations of consistent evidence obtained by meta-analyses of observational studies and MR studies together with meta-analyses of RCTs showed that vitamin D supplementation was associated with a decreased risk for all-cause mortality but not associated with the risk for Alzheimer's disease, hypertension, schizophrenia, or type 2 diabetes. The results indicated that vitamin D supplementation is a promising strategy with long-term preventive effects on multiple chronic diseases and thus has the potential to decrease all-cause mortality.

34979894,Vitamin D and Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Type 1 Diabetes Modulation.,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting people globally. Usually developed during childhood, T1D is characterized by the destruction of pancreatic β-cells due to immune cell attack and the establishment of an inflammatory process. The study aimed to investigate the effects of vitamin D through its nuclear receptor and the ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) through their lipid derivatives in T1D modulation. Both components exert anti-inflammatory activity and act directly on cells of the immune system, attenuating the destruction of insulin-producing cells. Furthermore, they lead to a better glycemic level, reducing the need for insulin and a normal immune state, such as C-peptide maintenance. Presently, our review highlights the significant studies that evaluated the supplementation of vitamin D and ω-3 PUFAs in humans and animal models in the modulation of T1D. The data collected suggests that supplementation can provide potential benefits, mainly when done early in the diagnosis, since it reduces the need for insulin and the risk of complications generated by the disease.",Bastos TSB; Braga TT; Davanso MR,"Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34979894/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34970669,Nutritional Supplements and Complementary Therapies in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 1 in 5 women of reproductive age, and is characterized by menstrual irregularities, clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and the presence of polycystic ovary morphology. One of the recommended treatment strategies in the international evidence-based guidelines is lifestyle modification, which includes diet and exercise, with the aim of improving a range of health outcomes. The incurable nature of PCOS reinforces the importance of developing novel and innovative symptomatic relief strategies, which are currently the only available approaches for improving quality of life for these women. Women with PCOS tend to be nutrient deficient in many common vitamins and minerals, thought to be associated with the psychological (depression, anxiety, etc.) and physiological (insulin resistance, diabetes, infertility, etc.) sequelae of the condition. Nutrient supplementation and the integration of complementary medicine as adjuncts to traditional lifestyle-based therapies in PCOS could therefore provide additional benefits to these women. In this review, we synthesize the evidence regarding nutrient supplementation and complementary therapies in PCOS, predominantly from randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, to provide an overview of the state of knowledge in this field. The evidence to date suggests that specific vitamins (B-12, inositols, folate, vitamins D, E, and K), vitamin-like nutrients (bioflavonoids and α-lipoic acid), minerals (calcium, zinc, selenium, and chromium picolinate), and other formulations (melatonin, ω-3 fatty acids, probiotics, and cinnamon), as well as some complementary approaches such as acupuncture and yoga may be beneficial in PCOS. However, there remain areas of uncertainty and key limitations in the literature that must be overcome before these therapies can be integrated into routine clinical practice.",Alesi S; Ee C; Moran LJ; Rao V; Mousa A,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34970669/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34967848,"Cancer Incidence, Mortality, Years of Life Lost, Years Lived With Disability, and Disability-Adjusted Life Years for 29 Cancer Groups From 2010 to 2019: A Systematic Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.","The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019 (GBD 2019) provided systematic estimates of incidence, morbidity, and mortality to inform local and international efforts toward reducing cancer burden. To estimate cancer burden and trends globally for 204 countries and territories and by Sociodemographic Index (SDI) quintiles from 2010 to 2019. The GBD 2019 estimation methods were used to describe cancer incidence, mortality, years lived with disability, years of life lost, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2019 and over the past decade. Estimates are also provided by quintiles of the SDI, a composite measure of educational attainment, income per capita, and total fertility rate for those younger than 25 years. Estimates include 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). In 2019, there were an estimated 23.6 million (95% UI, 22.2-24.9 million) new cancer cases (17.2 million when excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 10.0 million (95% UI, 9.36-10.6 million) cancer deaths globally, with an estimated 250 million (235-264 million) DALYs due to cancer. Since 2010, these represented a 26.3% (95% UI, 20.3%-32.3%) increase in new cases, a 20.9% (95% UI, 14.2%-27.6%) increase in deaths, and a 16.0% (95% UI, 9.3%-22.8%) increase in DALYs. Among 22 groups of diseases and injuries in the GBD 2019 study, cancer was second only to cardiovascular diseases for the number of deaths, years of life lost, and DALYs globally in 2019. Cancer burden differed across SDI quintiles. The proportion of years lived with disability that contributed to DALYs increased with SDI, ranging from 1.4% (1.1%-1.8%) in the low SDI quintile to 5.7% (4.2%-7.1%) in the high SDI quintile. While the high SDI quintile had the highest number of new cases in 2019, the middle SDI quintile had the highest number of cancer deaths and DALYs. From 2010 to 2019, the largest percentage increase in the numbers of cases and deaths occurred in the low and low-middle SDI quintiles. The results of this systematic analysis suggest that the global burden of cancer is substantial and growing, with burden differing by SDI. These results provide comprehensive and comparable estimates that can potentially inform efforts toward equitable cancer control around the world.",Kocarnik JM; Compton K; Dean FE; Fu W; Gaw BL; Harvey JD;

34967837,The Effects of Almond Consumption on Inflammatory Biomarkers in Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials.,"Conflicting findings have been reported regarding the effects of almond consumption on inflammatory markers. This study aimed to summarize the current literature to determine whether almonds can affect inflammatory markers. A systematic search was carried out in PubMed, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science up to March 2021. Randomized clinical trials that compared almond with no almond consumption were included. The outcomes of interest were changes in circulating C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, TNF-α, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) concentrations. The random-effects model was used to find the mean differences. In total, 18 trials with 847 participants were eligible for the current analysis. Participants' ages ranged from 26.3 to 69.6 y. Combining 16 studies, almond consumption significantly reduced serum concentrations of CRP [weighted mean difference (WMD): -0.25 mg/L; 95% CI: -0.43, -0.06 mg/L; I2 = 0.0%; P-heterogeneity = 0.633]. However, the beneficial effect of almond intake only occurred at doses <60 g/d. Pooling 11 effect sizes, almond interventions significantly decreased circulating IL-6 concentrations (WMD: -0.11 pg/mL; 95% CI: -0.21, -0.01 pg/mL; I2 = 19.9%; P-heterogeneity = 0.254). In subgroup analyses, effects on CRP and IL-6 were nonsignificant in unhealthy participants or those with obesity. In addition, almond consumption had no significant effect on TNF-α (WMD: -0.05 pg/mL; 95% CI: -0.11, 0.01 pg/mL; I2 = 0.0%; P-heterogeneity = 0.893; n = 6), ICAM-1 (WMD: 6.39 ng/mL; 95% CI: -9.44, 22.22 ng/mL; I2 = 66.6%; P-heterogeneity = 0.006; n = 7), or VCAM-1 (WMD: -8.31 ng/mL; 95% CI: -35.32, 18.71 ng/mL; I2 = 58.8%; P-heterogeneity = 0.033; n = 6). In conclusion, almond consumption beneficially affects CRP and IL-6 concentrations in adults. However, it has no beneficial effect on TNF-α, ICAM-1, or VCAM-1. More trials are needed to determine the effects of almonds on inflammation.",Fatahi S; Daneshzad E; Lotfi K; Azadbakht L,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34967837/,0,1,0,1,0,0
34967190,Effects of resistant starch supplementation on oxidative stress and inflammation biomarkers: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Animal experiments showed that resistant starch (RS) had an antioxidant and antiinflammatory effect. However, clinical studies showed both insignificant and significant effects of RS on inflammation and oxidative stress. The purpose of this work is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to investigate these effects. A systematic literature search was conducted on Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed and Cochrane electronic databases, which included studies from the earliest date of the database to September 2021. Key inclusion criteria were: RCTs; reporting at least one inflammatory or oxidative stress biomarker as endpoint; more than seven day intervention. Key exclusion criteria were: using a mixture of RS and other functional food ingredients as intervention substance; inappropriate controls. A total of 16 RCTs including 706 subjects were included. RS supplementation significantly improved total antioxidant capacity [standard mean difference (SMD) (95% CI): 2.64 (0.34, 4.94), p=0.03], and significantly reduced blood malondialdehyde concentration [SMD (95% CI): -0.55 (- 0.94, -0.17), p=0.01]. RS supplementation significantly reduced blood C-reactive protein concentration in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients [SMD (95% CI): -0.35 (-0.65, -0.05), p=0.02]. RS consumption significantly reduced blood interlukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor- concentration if removing one distinct trial. RS supplementation may significantly reduce a few oxidative-stress and inflammation biomarkers such as malondialdehyde and C-reactive protein, particularly in T2DM patients. Future work should investigate the optimal dosage of RS supplementation for modulating oxidative stress and inflammation biomarkers related to T2DM.",Lu J; Ma B; Qiu X; Sun Z; Xiong K,Asia Pacific journal of clinical nutrition,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34967190/,0,1,0,1,0,0
34965318,"The effect of vitamin D supplementation on mortality and intensive care unit admission of COVID-19 patients. A systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression.","The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on mortality and admission to intensive care unit (ICU) of COVID-19 patients. A systematic search of PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Web of Science and medRxiv with terms relative to vitamin D supplementation and COVID-19 was conducted on 26 March 2021. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software was used for the quantitative assessment of data and random-effects model was applied. To investigate the association between the dose of vitamin D and the outcomes of interest, meta-regression analysis was performed. Two thousand and seventy-eight patients from nine studies with data on mortality were included (583 received vitamin D supplementation, while 1495 did not). Sixty-one (10.46%) individuals in the treated group died, compared to 386 (25.81%) in the non-treated group (odds ratio [OR]: 0.597; 95% CI: 0.318-1.121; p = 0.109). Eight hundred and sixty patients from six studies with data on ICU admission were included (369 received vitamin D supplementation, while 491 did not). Forty-five (12.19%) individuals in the treated group were admitted to ICU, compared to 129 (26.27%) in the non-treated group (OR: 0.326; 95% CI: 0.149-0.712; p = 0.005). No significant linear relationship between vitamin D dose and log OR of mortality or log OR of ICU admission was observed. This meta-analysis indicates a beneficial role of vitamin D supplementation on ICU admission, but not on mortality, of COVID-19 patients. Further research is urgently needed to understand the benefit of vitamin D in COVID-19.",Tentolouris N; Samakidou G; Eleftheriadou I; Tentolouris A; Jude EB,Diabetes/metabolism research and reviews,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34965318/,0,1,0,1,0,0
34959910,Vitamin D Deficiency Is Inversely Associated with Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance.,"The study was conducted to comprehensively assess the association of the concentration of vitamin D in the blood and insulin resistance in non-diabetic subjects. The objective was to pool the results from all observational studies from the beginning of 1980 to August 2021. PubMed, Medline and Embase were systematically searched for the observational studies. Filters were used for more focused results. A total of 2248 articles were found after raw search which were narrowed down to 32 articles by the systematic selection of related articles. Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMAIR) was used as the measure of insulin resistance and correlation coefficient was used as a measure of the relationship between vitamin D levels and the insulin resistance. Risk of bias tables and summary plots were built using Revman software version 5.3 while Comprehensive meta-analysis version 3 was used for the construction of forest plot. The results showed an inverse association between the status of vitamin D and insulin resistance (r = -0.217; 95% CI = -0.161 to -0.272; <i>p</i> = 0.000). A supplement of vitamin D can help reduce the risk of insulin resistance; however further studies, like randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the results.",Rafiq S; Jeppesen PB,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34959910/,0,1,0,0,0,0
34959828,A Systematic Review of the Cardiometabolic Benefits of Plant Products Containing Mixed Phenolics and Polyphenols in Postmenopausal Women: Insufficient Evidence for Recommendations to This Specific Population.,"Menopause is characterized by endocrine and physiological changes and is often accompanied by increased body weight and cholesterol, glucose intolerance, and/or hypertension. These alterations are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) that may be moderate by dietary plant phenolic compounds. In this review, we examine the current evidence of the impact of a variety of plant products (foods, extracts, beverages) rich in a mixture of phenolics and polyphenols on: (i) glucose and insulin levels; (ii) lipid profile; (iii) blood pressure; and (iv) biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress in postmenopausal women. We critically evaluate both the results of a range of intervention studies conducted in this specific subpopulation and the level of evidence supporting the benefits of consuming those products after the menopause. Overall, the current available evidence does not allow for specific dietary recommendations of these plant products rich in phenolics and polyphenols in this high-risk subpopulation. Our data show rather variable and small effects of the different products examined on the cardiometabolic biomarkers and further support the need to: (1) improve the quality of the study designs and data reporting; and (2) understand the variability in the response of the different biomarkers and establish clear differences between healthy and cardiometabolic disease levels.",Sánchez-Martínez L; Periago MJ; García-Alonso J; García-Conesa MT; González-Barrio R,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34959828/,0,1,0,0,0,0

34931982,Creatine Supplementation in Type 2 Diabetic Patients: A Systematic Review of Randomized Clinical Trials.,"Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is the most common form of diabetes. The initial treatment of type 2 DM consists of the adoption of healthy lifestyle habits together with several classes of hypoglycemic agents. However, these medications are not always able to reduce the blood glucose levels in all patients. Therefore, creatine supplementation has emerged as a new putative candidate for type 2 DM treatment. This systematic review aimed to investigate the effects (benefits and harms) of creatine supplementation in patients with type 2 diabetes through a systematic review. The studies were searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CENTRAL, SPORTDiscus, and CINAHL databases, without date or language restrictions. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias table. The certainty of the evidence was classified using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included (87 participants). Overall, the methodological quality was classified as unclear to a high risk of bias. Each trial compared creatine supplementation with a different control group (placebo, metformin, and glibenclamide). Creatine supplementation seems to be effective in decreasing glycemic levels and glycosylated hemoglobin concentrations compared to placebo. No difference was observed compared to metformin or glibenclamide with creatine, and all treatments were able to reduce blood glucose levels. No major adverse effects were observed. Based on the low certainty of evidence, creatine supplementation was shown to be a hypoglycemic intervention for patients with type 2 diabetes, without major adverse events reported. However, well- designed RCTs with larger sample sizes and long-term outcomes are needed to support this evidence.",Mancini de Sousa M; Nakata MTK; Baldini CES; de Oliveira-Sales EB; Boim MA; Martimbianco ALC; Maquigussa E,Current diabetes reviews,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34931982/,0,1,0,0,0,0
34907820,Magnesium supplementation for glycemic status in women with gestational diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The effect of magnesium supplementation on glycemic status in women with gestational diabetes remains controversial and this meta-analysis aims to explore the efficacy of magnesium supplementation for gestational diabetes. We have searched PubMed, Excerpta Medica database, Web of science, Elton B. Stephens. Company, and Cochrane library databases. The meta-analysis included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of magnesium supplementation for gestational diabetes and was performed using the random-effect model. Four RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, compared with placebo in gestational diabetes, magnesium supplementation was associated with significantly reduced fasting plasma glucose (standard mean difference [SMD] = -0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.28 to -0.70; <i>p</i> < .00001), serum insulin (SMD = -0.75; 95% CI = -1.24 to -0.26; <i>p</i> = .003), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (SMD = -0.74; 95% CI = -1.10 to -0.39; <i>p</i> < .0001) and increased quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (SMD = 0.47; 95% CI = 0.12 to 0.82; <i>p</i> = .008). In addition, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (SMD = -0.39; 95% CI = -0.73 to -0.04; <i>p</i> = .03) and total cholesterol (SMD = -0.62; 95% CI = -0.97 to -0.27; <i>p</i> = .0005) were also obviously decreased in the magnesium group than those in the control group.

34900833,Nutrition and Diet Therapy in Diabetes Mellitus: A Roadmap based on available evidence.,"Nutrition is considered as a primary approach for diabetes management. It needs a comprehensive assessment of evidence to identify nutritional dimensions that should be explored in the future. We aimed to provide a roadmap on diabetes and nutrition and clarify research gaps in this field. In the present review, we searched Scopus and PubMed electronic databases to collect eligible publications with English and Farsi languages from 2015 to December 2019 in the field of nutrition and diabetes. Relevant papers were classified into six subgroups including biochemistry/ animal studies, clinical nutrition, food industry, genetic, public health, and dietary supplements. Based on evidence-based pyramid, publications were categorized as well. Publications trend from 2015 to 2019 and frequency of publications in each category were provided. Finally, we reached 438 eligible papers. Most studies (40.86%) were clinical trials and in most human studies (<i>n</i> = 224) patients with type 2 diabetes were considered. Probiotic/prebiotic/ symbiotic, vitamin D, and omega-3/fish oil were the most frequent studied dietary supplements. Low portions of studies were dedicated to diabetic children (<i>n</i> = 3), type 1 diabetes (<i>n</i> = 6), diabetes complications (<i>n</i> = 23) and GDM (<i>n</i> = 25). An increasing trend in nutrition publications in the field of diabetes was observed. Publications were mostly dedicated to clinical trials with a focus on dietary supplements.

34896248,Mulberry leaf (Morus alba L.): A review of its potential influences in mechanisms of action on metabolic diseases.,"The leaves of Morus alba L. (called Sangye in Chinese, ML), which belong to the genus Morus., are highly valuable edible plants in nutrients and nutraceuticals. In Asian countries including China, Japan and Korea, ML are widely used as functional foods including beverages, noodles and herbal tea because of its biological and nutritional value. Meanwhile, ML-derived products in the form of powders, extracts and capsules are widely consumed as dietary supplements for controlling blood glucose and sugar. Clinical studies showed that ML play an important role in the treatment of metabolic diseases including the diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, atherosclerosis and hypertension. People broadly use ML due to their nutritiousness, deliciousness, safety, and abundant active benefits. However, the systematic pharmacological mechanisms of ML on metabolic diseases have not been fully revealed. Therefore, in order to fully utilize and scale relevant products about ML, this review summarizes the up-to-date information about the ML and its constituents effecting on metabolic disease.",Zhang R; Zhang Q; Zhu S; Liu B; Liu F; Xu Y,Pharmacological research,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34896248/,1,0,0,0,0,0

These bioactive metabolites have shown potential as antiviral and immune system strengthener natural agents through diverse cellular and physiological pathways modulation with no toxicity evidence, widely available, and inexpensive. In light of the emerging literature, this paper compiles the most recent information describing the molecular mechanisms that underlie the nutraceutical potentials of these mushroom metabolites suggesting their effectiveness if combined with existing drug therapies while discussing the food functionality of mushrooms. The findings raise hope that these mushroom bioactive metabolites may be utilized as natural therapies considering their therapeutic potential while anticipating further research designing clinical trials and developing new drug therapies while encouraging their consumption as a natural adjuvant in preventing and controlling life-threatening conditions and diseases. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Diabetes, cardiovascular, hypertension, cancer, DNA damage, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity are among the world's largest life-threatening conditions and diseases. Several mushroom bioactive compounds, including polysaccharides, eritadenine, lignin, chitosan, mevinolin, and astrakurkurone have been found potential in tackling these diseases through diverse cellular and physiological pathways modulation with no toxicity evidence, suggesting their use as nutraceutical foods in preventing and controlling these life-threatening conditions and diseases.",Ishara J; Buzera A; Mushagalusa GN; Hammam ARA; Munga J; Karanja P; Kinyuru J,Journal of food biochemistry,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34888869/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34884724,Nutraceutical Approach to Chronic Osteoarthritis: From Molecular Research to Clinical Evidence.,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative inflammatory condition of the joint cartilage that currently affects approximately 58 million adults in the world. It is characterized by pain, stiffness, and a reduced range of motion with regard to the arthritic joints. These symptoms can cause in the long term a greater risk of overweight/obesity, diabetes mellitus, and falls and fractures. Although the current guidelines for the treatment of OA suggest, as the gold standard for this condition, pharmacological treatment characterized by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), opioids, and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-specific drugs, a great interest has been applied to nutraceutical supplements, which include a heterogeneous class of molecules with great potential to reduce inflammation, oxidative stress, pain, and joint stiffness and improve cartilage formation. The purpose of this review is to describe the potential application of nutraceuticals in OA, highlighting its molecular mechanisms of actions and data of efficacy and safety (when available).",Colletti A; Cicero AFG,International journal of molecular sciences,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34884724/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34857250,The effects of the ginger supplements on inflammatory parameters in type 2 diabetes patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.,"The effect of ginger supplements on inflammatory biomarkers and oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) has been investigated, but findings are inconsistent. This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to determine the effects of ginger supplementation on inflammatory parameters (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP], tumour necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-α], and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) in patients with T2DM. We performed a systematic search using PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Web of Science for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), published until March 17, 2021. The quality assessment was carried out using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool. The Q-test and I 2 tests were used for the determination of heterogeneity of the included studies. Data were pooled using a random-effects model, and weighted mean difference (WMD) was used for the overall effect size. Pooled findings of the five RCTs demonstrated that ginger supplementations had significantly reduced hs-CRP (WMD -0.42 mg/L; 95% CI, -0.78, -0.05, P = 0.03), TNF-α (-2.13 pg/mL; 95% CI: -3.41, -0.86, P = 0.001), and IL-6 (WMD: -0.61 pg/mL; 95% CI: -0.92, -0.30, P = 0.001) levels in patients with T2DM. The quality assessment of the studies showed that all of the included studies were at high risk of bias. The meta-analysis shows that ginger supplementations reduced inflammatory parameters in patients with T2DM. Nonetheless, the reduction is relatively small, and its meaningful clinical effects are unknown. Future high-quality RCTs are needed to confirm the beneficial effects of ginger supplementation in patients with T2DM.",Mohammad A; Falahi E; Mohd Yusof BN; Hanipah ZN; Sabran MR; Mohamad Yusof L; Gheitasvand M,Clinical nutrition ESPEN,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34857250/,0,1,0,1,0,0
34847213,"Curcumin supplementation improves biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation in conditions of obesity, type 2 diabetes and NAFLD: updating the status of clinical evidence.","Oxidative stress and inflammation remain the major complications implicated in the development and progression of metabolic complications, including obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In fact, due to their abundant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, there is a general interest in understanding the therapeutic effects of some major food-derived bioactive compounds like curcumin against diverse metabolic diseases. Hence, a systematic search, through prominent online databases such as MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar was done focusing on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on the impact of curcumin supplementation in individuals with diverse metabolic complications, including obesity, T2D and NAFLD. Summarized findings suggest that curcumin supplementation can significantly reduce blood glucose and triglycerides levels, including markers of liver function like alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in patients with T2D and NAFLD. Importantly, this effect was consistent with the reduction of predominant markers of oxidative stress and inflammation, such as the levels of malonaldehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in these patients. Although RCTs suggest that curcumin is beneficial in ameliorating some metabolic complications, future research is still necessary to enhance its absorption and bioavailability profile, while also optimizing the most effective therapeutic doses.",Mokgalaboni K; Ntamo Y; Ziqubu K; Nyambuya TM; Nkambule BB; Mazibuko-Mbeje SE; Gabuza KB; Chellan N; Tiano L; Dludla PV,Food & function,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34847213/,0,1,0,0,0,0

We therefore aimed to investigate the effect of oral Mg supplementation on glucose and insulin-sensitivity parameters in participants with diabetes or at high risk of diabetes, compared with a placebo. Several databases were searched investigating the effect of oral Mg supplementation vs placebo in patients with diabetes or conditions at high risk of diabetes. Data were reported as standardized mean differences (SMDs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using follow-up data of glucose and insulin-sensitivity parameters. Compared with placebo, Mg supplementation reduced fasting plasma glucose in people with diabetes. In people at high risk of diabetes, Mg supplementation significantly improved plasma glucose per se, and after a 2 h oral glucose tolerance test. Furthermore, Mg supplementation demonstrated an improvement in insulin sensitivity markers. In conclusion, Mg supplementation appears to have a beneficial role and improves glucose parameters in people with diabetes. Moreover, our work indicates that Mg supplementation may improve insulin-sensitivity parameters in those at high risk of diabetes.",Veronese N; Dominguez LJ; Pizzol D; Demurtas J; Smith L; Barbagallo M,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34836329/,0,1,0,1,0,1

Inflammaging is characterized by subclinical chronic, low grade, steady inflammatory states and is considered a crucial underlying cause behind the high mortality and morbidity rate associated with ARDs. Although a coherent set of studies detailed the underlying pathomechanisms of inflammaging, the potential benefits from non-toxic nutrients from natural and synthetic sources in modulating or delaying inflammaging processes was not discussed. In this review, the available literature and recent updates of natural and synthetic nutrients that help in controlling inflammaging process was explored.

34836042,Nutrition as Prevention Factor of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A Narrative Review.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as a glucose tolerance disorder with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. GDM is associated with several adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Management to reduce the incidence of GDM could decrease the incidence of these complications. Modification of nutrition in the prevention of GDM is postulated. The vital issue in GDM prevention is the implementation of proper dietary patterns, appropriate physical activity, and a combination of diet and lifestyle modifications. However, intervention studies examining the effects of diet and lifestyle on GDM prevention are contradictory. The aim of this study was to review the scientific evidence on nutritional prevention strategies, including diet and supplementation of some substances such as probiotics, micro/macroelements, fiber, myoinositol, and vitamins that may be effective in reducing the risk of GDM. The presented article is a narrative review. This article indicates that certain nutritional factors may have some benefit in preventing GDM. However, further studies in a variety of populations and large groups of patients are needed.

34835934,Influence of Vitamin D Supplementation on Mental Health in Diabetic Patients: A Systematic Review.,"Diabetes is associated with a number of mental health consequences, including enhanced risk of depression and anxiety, as well as decreased quality of life, and vitamin D deficiency is considered to be one of the factors that influence these outcomes in diabetic patients. The aim of the present study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature presenting the data regarding the influence of vitamin D supplementation on mental health in diabetic adults. This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database (Registration number CRD42020155779). A systematic search of the PubMed and Web of Science databases was performed, and the intervention studies published until September 2021 were included in the review. The human studies were included if an adult sample of diabetic individuals received vitamin D supplementation during the intervention and its effect on any mental health aspect was assessed, but studies presenting the influence of combined supplementation of multiple nutrients were excluded. After removing duplicate records, a total of 8514 publications were screened and assessed independently by two researchers, based on their title, abstract, and full text. Finally, six studies were included in the current systematic review, and the risk of bias was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The included studies analyzed the influence of a specific dose of vitamin D, or different doses of vitamin D, or compared the results of supplementation with a specific dose of vitamin D against the placebo group. The supplementation was performed for at least 12 weeks. The mental health outcomes analyzed in these studies included health-related quality of life, depression, anxiety, stress, and general mental health status of adult diabetic patients. The results of the majority of the studies confirmed the positive influence of vitamin D supplementation on the mental health of diabetic individuals. Those studies that analyzed the influence of vitamin D supplementation on depression and anxiety established the beneficial effect of the vitamin. In some studies, the influence of vitamin D supplementation on the health-related quality of life was not considered unless combined with mindfulness training. However, it must be emphasized that different dosage regimens and intervention periods were followed in the reviewed studies, and only a small number of studies were randomized against placebo, which should be considered as a limitation of the present study. The findings of the conducted systematic review demonstrated the positive influence of vitamin D supplementation on the mental health of diabetic patients, which was proved for anxiety and depression, but in the case of health-related quality of life, the positive effect was observed only when the intervention included mindfulness training. These outcomes suggest that supplementation should be recommended to improve the vitamin D status and the mental health of patients in this group.",Guzek D; Kołota A; Lachowicz K; Skolmowska D; Stachoń M; Głąbska D,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34835934/,0,1,0,0,0,0

Currently, their potential to be used as pharmaceutical agents is underestimated. Chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes and aging have high incidence rates in the modern world. Furthermore, pharmaceutical agents targeting pathogenic microorganisms have been hampered by the growing of antimicrobial resistance threats. The idea of food therapy leads to extensive nutraceuticals research on the potential of exotic fruits such as <i>N. lappaceum</i> and <i>N. ramboutan-ake</i> to act as supplements. Phytochemicals such as phenolic compounds that present in the fruit act as potent antioxidants that contribute to the protective effects against diseases induced by oxidative stress. Fruit residuals such as the peel and seeds hold greater nutraceutical potential than the edible part. This review highlights the antioxidant and biological activities (anti-neoplastic, anti-microbial, hypoglycemic actions and anti-aging), and chemical contents of different parts of <i>N. lappaceum</i> and <i>N. ramboutan-ake</i>.

34831805,Nutritional Management in Bariatric Surgery Patients.,"The obesity epidemic, mainly due to lifestyle changes in recent decades, leads to serious comorbidities that reduce life expectancy. This situation is affecting the health policies of many nations around the world. Traditional measures such as diet, physical activity, and drugs are often not enough to achieve weight loss goals and to maintain the results over time. Bariatric surgery (BS) includes various techniques, which favor rapid and sustained weight loss. BS is a useful and, in most cases, the best treatment in severe and complicated obesity. In addition, it has a greater benefit/risk ratio than non-surgical traditional therapies. BS can allow the obese patient to lose weight quickly compared with traditional lifestyle changes, and with a greater probability of maintaining the results. Moreover, BS promotes improvements in metabolic parameters, even diabetes remission, and in the quality of life. These changes can lead to an increase of life expectancy by over 6 years on average. The nutrition of people before and after BS must be the subject of indications from a trained staff, and patients must be followed in the subsequent years to reduce the risk of malnutrition and the associated problems. In particular, it is still debated whether it is necessary to lose weight prior to surgery, a procedure that can facilitate the surgeon's work reducing the surgical risk, but at the same time, lengthens preparation times increasing the risks associated with concomitant pathologies. Furthermore, preventing nutritional deficiencies prior to the intervention can improve the results and reduce short- and long-term mortality.",Deledda A; Pintus S; Loviselli A; Fosci M; Fantola G; Velluzzi F,International journal of environmental research and public health,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34831805/,1,0,0,0,0,0

34815552,The health effects of vitamin D supplementation: evidence from human studies.,"Vitamin D supplementation can prevent and cure nutritional rickets in infants and children. Preclinical and observational data suggest that the vitamin D endocrine system has a wide spectrum of skeletal and extra-skeletal activities. There is consensus that severe vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentration <30 nmol/l) should be corrected, whereas most guidelines recommend serum 25OHD concentrations of >50 nmol/l for optimal bone health in older adults. However, the causal link between vitamin D and many extra-skeletal outcomes remains unclear. The VITAL, ViDA and D2d randomized clinical trials (combined number of participants >30,000) indicated that vitamin D supplementation of vitamin D-replete adults (baseline serum 25OHD >50 nmol/l) does not prevent cancer, cardiovascular events, falls or progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Post hoc analysis has suggested some extra-skeletal benefits for individuals with vitamin D deficiency. Over 60 Mendelian randomization studies, designed to minimize bias from confounding, have evaluated the consequences of lifelong genetically lowered serum 25OHD concentrations on various outcomes and most studies have found null effects. Four Mendelian randomization studies found an increased risk of multiple sclerosis in individuals with genetically lowered serum 25OHD concentrations. In conclusion, supplementation of vitamin D-replete individuals does not provide demonstrable health benefits.

One such plant is <i>Berberis aristata</i> which is rich in vitamins, minerals, and various phytochemicals amongst which Berberine is the principal bioactive compound with a range of reported health benefits, and some of the commercial formulations like Rasaut, Darvyadi Leha are being used for the treatments of jaundice, malaria, typhoid fever, inflammation, eye infection, diarrhea, wound healing, etc. The hepatoprotective, antidiabetic, antitumor, anti-cancerous, properties are the recent additions to its functional importance. Berberine has significant bioactivities in the treatments of different diseases. Besides its remarkable applications, the berberine has low efficacy due to its low solubility in water, poor absorption, and low bioavailability. This problem can be solved by using some techniques like Nanotechnology which has been found to increase its solubility in water, bioavailability, and absorption and hence provide a better delivery system of berberine. This review illuminates the therapeutic applications of the plant <i>Berberis aristata</i>, scientific validation to its traditional uses, role of berberine in the treatment of various diseases through its different bioactivities, major flaws in berberine treatment, and the role of nanotechnology in minimizing those flaws and increasing its overall efficacy.Key teaching pointsPlant Berberis aristata has been used since ancient times for the treatment of various ailments like jaundice, hepatitis, fever, bleeding, inflammation, diarrhea, malaria, skin and eye infections, chronic rheumatism, and urinary disorders.Berberine is the major and most significant phytochemical among numerous phytochemicals present in plant Berberis aristata.Berberine has significantly shown many potent effect against emerging diseases like cancer and diabetes.

Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Embase and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched until April 3rd, 2021. Randomized controlled trials regarding spontaneously achieved singleton pregnancies who were treated with progestogen before 20 weeks of pregnancy and were compared with those women in unexposed control groups were selected for inclusion. We performed pairwise meta-analyses with the random-effects model. The risk of bias was assessed according to the Cochrane Collaboration tool. The primary outcomes included preeclampsia (PE), and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), with the results presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We identified nine eligible studies involving 6439 participants. The pooled OR of subsequent PE following early progestogen supplementation was 0.64 (95% CI 0.42-0.98, moderate quality of evidence). A lower OR for PE was observed in the progestogen group when the subgroup analysis was performed in the vaginal subgroup (OR 0.62, 95%CI 0.40-0.96). There was insufficient evidence of a difference in the rate of GDM between pregnant women with early progestogen supplementation and unexposed pregnant women (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.79-1.32, low quality of evidence). The pooled OR of low birth weight (LBW) following oral dydrogesterone was 0.57 (95% CI 0.34-0.95, moderate quality of evidence).

Use of vaginal micronized progesterone (Utrogestan) in spontaneously achieved singleton pregnancies with threatened miscarriage before 20 weeks of pregnancy may reduce the risk of PE in later gestational weeks. Among spontaneously achieved singleton pregnancies with threatened miscarriage or a history of recurrent miscarriage, use of oral dydrogesterone before 20 weeks of pregnancy may result in a lower risk of LBW in later gestational weeks. However, the available data were not sufficient to reach definitive conclusions, which highlighted the need for future studies.",Wu H; Zhang S; Lin X; He J; Wang S; Zhou P,Reproductive biology and endocrinology : RB&E,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34732210/,0,1,0,1,0,0

34688697,Vitamin K: A vital micronutrient with the cardioprotective potential against diabetes-associated complications.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The conventional therapies seem to offer minimal long-term cardioprotection against diabetes-related complications in patients living with T2D. There is a growing interest in understanding the therapeutic effects of food-derived bioactive compounds in protecting or managing these metabolic diseases. This includes uncovering the therapeutic potential of fat-soluble micronutrients such as vitamin K, which are abundantly found in green leafy vegetables. We searched the major electronic databases including PubMed, Web of Sciences, Scopus, Google Scholar and Science direct. The search retrieved randomized clinical trials and preclinical studies, reporting on the impact of vitamin K on CVD-related complications in T2D. The current review updates clinical evidence on the therapeutic benefits of vitamin K by attenuating CVD-risk factors such as blood lipid profiles, blood pressure, as well as markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in patients with T2D. Importantly, the summarized preclinical evidence provides a unique perspective into the pathophysiological mechanisms that could be targeted by vitamin K in the primary prevention of T2D-related complications. Lastly, this review further explores the controversies related to the cardioprotective effects of vitamin K, and also provides the basic information such as the source and bioavailability profile of this micronutrient is covered to highlight its therapeutic potential.",Mokgalaboni K; Nkambule BB; Ntamo Y; Ziqubu K; Nyambuya TM; Mazibuko-Mbeje SE; Gabuza KB; Chellan N; Cirilli I; Tiano L; Dludla PV,Life sciences,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34688697/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34684468,Experimental Animal Studies Support the Role of Dietary Advanced Glycation End Products in Health and Disease.,"The increased incidence of obesity, diabetes mellitus, aging, and associated comorbidities indicates the interplay between genetic and environmental influences. Several dietary components have been identified to play a role in the pathogenesis of the so-called ""modern diseases"", and their complications including advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are generated during the food preparation and processing. Diet-derived advanced glycation end products (dAGEs) can be absorbed in the gastrointestinal system and contribute to the total body AGEs' homeostasis, partially excreted in the urine, while a significant amount accumulates to various tissues. Various in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies support that dAGEs play an important role in health and disease, in a similar way to those endogenously formed. Animal studies using wild type, as well as experimental, animal models have shown that dAGEs contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of various diseases and their complications, and are involved in the changes related to the aging process. In addition, they support that dAGEs' restriction reduces insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and inflammation; restores immune alterations; and prevents or delays the progression of aging, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and their complications. These data can be extrapolated in humans and strongly support that dAGEs' restriction should be considered as an alternative therapeutic intervention.",Peppa M; Mavroeidi I,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34684468/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Current systematic review was performed to summarize the efficacy of saffron intake on liver enzymes. An electronic database search was conducted on PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane for RCTs comparing effect of saffron and placebo on liver enzymes from inception to July 2021. There was no restriction in language of included studies and we calculated the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) for each variable. Random-effect model was used to calculate effect size. Eight studies (n = 463 participants) were included in the systematic review. The saffron intake was associated with a statistically significant decrease in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (SMD: -0.18; 95% CI: -0.34, -0.02; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%) in comparison to placebo intake.

The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, and LILACS databases were consulted until July 2019. Serum vitamin D concentration (25-hydroxyvitamin D in nmol/L), fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, serum calcium concentration, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), parathyroid hormone (PTH) and body mass index (BMI) were evaluated. Similar results in at least two trials were plotted using the RevMan 5; Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, Reino Unido. The quality of the evidence was generated according to the classification, development, and evaluation of the classification of the recommendations.  Four studies were included in the present review (200 women). The findings indicate that there is no difference in the postpartum period in women diagnosed with previous GDM who received vitamin D supplementation in the prenatal and/or in the postpartum period, showing only that there was a significant increase in the concentration of vitamin D (relative risk [RR]: 1.85; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-2.68).  This increase in the concentration of vitamin D should be interpreted with caution, since the assessment of the quality of the evidence was very low. For the other analyzed outcomes, there was no significance between the intervention and control groups, and the outcomes, when analyzed in their strength of evidence, were considered very low and low in their evaluation.",Kron-Rodrigues MR; Rudge MVC; Lima SAM,Revista brasileira de ginecologia e obstetricia : revista da Federacao Brasileira das Sociedades de Ginecologia e Obstetricia,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34670305/,0,1,0,1,0,0
34628984,Tackling physical inactivity in Scandinavia: a narrative review of reviews supplemented by expert interviews.,"<i>Aims:</i> This study aims to identify physical inactivity-related challenges and motives, based on reviews and supplemented by expert interviews with Danish national experts on physical inactivity, providing a general discussion of the subject ultimately generating knowledge useable in a Scandinavian context. <i>Methods:</i> This study is framed as a narrative review of scientific review literature on physical inactivity, limited to the general population. The review is supplemented by expert interviews with Danish national experts on physical inactivity. We used thematic coding of the included reviews, while using hermeneutic interpretation analysis for the expert interviews. <i>Results:</i> Based on 11 included reviews, we highlighted four themes based on our analysis of reviews: (a) socioeconomic determinants of physical activity; (b) life-course perspective; (c) physical inactivity and older adults aged 60+ years; and (d) intervention recommendations. The supplementary expert interviews revealed three additional themes: (a) the individual history with physical activity; (b) sporting organisation importance; and (c) society responsibility for physical inactivity. <i>Conclusions:</i> Collectively this study concludes, based on review and expert interviews, that a number of determinants and correlations for physical inactivity affect the individual from various socioecological levels. Based on this review, we suggest moving beyond the 'upstream' public health approach of randomised controlled trials and consider complex interventions targeting physical inactivity from several levels. Physical inactivity should be acknowledged as a 'wicked problem' that requires a systems-based approach instead of a single quick fix. Future work with physical inactivity would profit from focus on the life-course perspective, sporting clubs' responsiveness and physical literacy.",Ryom K; Simonsen CB; Eshøj S; Nielsen G; Troelsen J; Maindal HT,Scandinavian journal of public health,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34628984/,1,0,0,0,0,0

However, based on data from different studies, the effectiveness of this product is not uniform. Therefore, we conducted a dose-response meta-analysis between guar gum supplementation and lipid profile. Five databases (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar) were searched to identify relevant articles published up to July 2020. The weighted mean difference (WMD) was derived based on the random-effects model. Overall findings were generated from 25 eligible trials. Patients' conditions included hyperlipidemia, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, overweight, carotid endarterectomy, and menopausal women. Prescribed gum dose varied between 100 mg/d and 30 g/d for 1-24 months. Compared with control groups, guar gum supplementation decreased total cholesterol (TC) by -20.41 mg/dL (95% CI: -26.76 to -14.07; P < 0.001) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) by -17.37 mg/dL (95% CI: -23.60 to -11.13; P < 0.001), but did not change triglycerides (TG) (WMD: -6.53 mg/dL, 95% CI: -16.03 to 2.97; P = 0.178) and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) (WMD: -0.62 mg/dL, 95% CI: -1.68 to 0.44, P = 0.252).

The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the evidence obtained from animal and human studies on the effects of chicory on metabolic indicators (such as inflammation, oxidative stress, blood sugar and dyslipidaemia) of diabetes mellitus. This systematic search was performed in ProQuest, PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase and Science Direct databases and on articles published until August 2021. All of the animal studies and clinical trials included in this systematic review that assessed the effect of chicory on metabolic risk markers in diabetes were published in English language journals. Finally, amongst 686 articles, only 23 articles met the needed criteria for further analysis. Out of 23 articles, 3 studies on humans and 20 studies on animals have been carried out. Fifteen of the 19 studies that evaluated the effect of chicory on the glycaemic index showed that Cichorium intybus improved blood glucose index (it had no effect in two human studies and three animal studies). Ten of the 13 studies evaluating the effect of Cichorium intybus on lipid profiles showed that it improved dyslipidaemia. Also, all 12 studies showed that chicory significantly reduces oxidative stress and inflammation. According to the available evidence, Cichorium intybus might improve the glycaemic status, dyslipidaemia, oxidative stress and inflammation.

34602925,Chamomile as a potential remedy for obesity and metabolic syndrome.,"Obesity is an increasing health concern related to many metabolic disorders, including metabolic syndrome, diabetes type 2 and cardiovascular diseases. Many studies suggest that herbal products can be useful dietary supplements for weight management due to the presence of numerous biologically active compounds, including antioxidant polyphenols that can counteract obesity-related oxidative stress. In this review we focus on <i>Matricaria chamomilla</i>, commonly known as chamomile, and one of the most popular medicinal plants in the world. Thanks to a high content of phenolic compounds and essential oils, preparations from chamomile flowers demonstrate a number of pharmacological effects, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and sedative actions as well as improving gastrointestinal function. Several recent studies have shown certain positive effects of chamomile preparations in the prevention of obesity and complications of diabetes. These effects were associated with modulation of signaling pathways involving the AMP-activated protein kinase, NF-κB, Nrf2 and PPARγ transcription factors. However, the potential of chamomile in the management of obesity seems to be underestimated. This review summarizes current data on the use of chamomile and its individual components (apigenin, luteolin, essential oils) to treat obesity and related metabolic disorders in cell and animal models and in human studies. Special attention is paid to molecular mechanisms that can be involved in the anti-obesity effects of chamomile preparations.

34587244,"GlyNAC Supplementation Improves Glutathione Deficiency, Oxidative Stress, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Inflammation, Aging Hallmarks, Metabolic Defects, Muscle Strength, Cognitive Decline, and Body Composition: Implications for Healthy Aging.","Cellular increases in oxidative stress (OxS) and decline in mitochondrial function are identified as key defects in aging, but underlying mechanisms are poorly understood and interventions are lacking. Defects linked to OxS and impaired mitochondrial fuel oxidation, such as inflammation, insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction, and aging hallmarks, are present in older humans and are associated with declining strength and cognition, as well as the development of sarcopenic obesity. Investigations on the origins of elevated OxS and mitochondrial dysfunction in older humans led to the discovery that deficiencies of the antioxidant tripeptide glutathione (GSH) and its precursor amino acids glycine and cysteine may be contributory. Supplementation with GlyNAC (combination of glycine and N-acetylcysteine as a cysteine precursor) was found to improve/correct cellular glycine, cysteine, and GSH deficiencies; lower OxS; and improve mitochondrial function, inflammation, insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction, genotoxicity, and multiple aging hallmarks; and improve muscle strength, exercise capacity, cognition, and body composition. This review discusses evidence from published rodent studies and human clinical trials to provide a detailed summary of available knowledge regarding the effects of GlyNAC supplementation on age-associated defects and aging hallmarks, as well as discussing why GlyNAC supplementation could be effective in promoting healthy aging. It is particularly exciting that GlyNAC supplementation appears to reverse multiple aging hallmarks, and if confirmed in a randomized clinical trial, it could introduce a transformative paradigm shift in aging and geriatrics. GlyNAC supplementation could be a novel nutritional approach to improve age-associated defects and promote healthy aging, and existing data strongly support the need for additional studies to explore the role and impact of GlyNAC supplementation in aging.",Sekhar RV,The Journal of nutrition,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34587244/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34579146,Nuts: Natural Pleiotropic Nutraceuticals.,"Common nuts (tree nuts and peanuts) are energy-dense foods that nature has gifted with a complex matrix of beneficial nutrients and bioactives, including monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, high-quality protein, fiber, non-sodium minerals, tocopherols, phytosterols, and antioxidant phenolics. These nut components synergize to favorably influence metabolic and vascular physiology pathways, ameliorate cardiovascular risk factors and improve cardiovascular prognosis. There is increasing evidence that nuts positively impact myriad other health outcomes as well. Nut consumption is correlated with lower cancer incidence and cancer mortality, and decreased all-cause mortality. Favorable effects on cognitive function and depression have also been reported. Randomized controlled trials consistently show nuts have a cholesterol-lowering effect. Nut consumption also confers modest improvements on glycemic control, blood pressure (BP), endothelial function, and inflammation. Although nuts are energy-dense foods, they do not predispose to obesity, and in fact may even help in weight loss. Tree nuts and peanuts, but not peanut butter, generally produce similar positive effects on outcomes. First level evidence from the PREDIMED trial shows that, in the context of a Mediterranean diet, consumption of 30 g/d of nuts (walnuts, almonds, and hazelnuts) significantly lowered the risk of a composite endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, and death from cardiovascular disease) by ≈30% after intervention for 5 y. Impressively, the nut-supplemented diet reduced stroke risk by 45%. As they are rich in salutary bioactive compounds and beneficially impact various health outcomes, nuts can be considered natural pleiotropic nutraceuticals.",Ros E; Singh A; O'Keefe JH,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34579146/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34579011,Is Supplementation with Micronutrients Still Necessary during Pregnancy? A Review.,"Proper nutrition during pregnancy is important to prevent nutritional imbalances that interfere with pregnancy. Micronutrients play critical roles in embryogenesis, fetal growth, and maternal health, as energy, protein, vitamin, and mineral needs can increase during pregnancy. Increased needs can be met by increasing the intake of dietary micronutrients. Severe micronutrient deficiency or excess during pregnancy can have negative effects on fetal growth (intrauterine growth retardation, low birth weight, or congenital malformations) and pregnancy development (pre-eclampsia or gestational diabetes). We investigate whether it is necessary to continue micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy to improve women's health in this stage and whether this supplementation could prevent and control pathologies associated with pregnancy. The present review aims to summarize evidence on the effects of nutritional deficiencies on maternal and newborn morbidity. This aim is addressed by critically reviewing results from published studies on supplementation with different nutrients during pregnancy. For this, major scientific databases, scientific texts, and official webpages have been consulted. PubMed searches using the terms ""pregnancy"" OR ""maternal-fetal health"" AND ""vitamins"" OR ""minerals"" OR ""supplementation"" AND ""requirement"" OR ""deficiency nutrients"" were performed. There are accepted interventions during pregnancy, such as folic acid supplementation to prevent congenital neural tube defects, potassium iodide supplementation to correct neurodevelopment, and oral iron supplementation during the second half of pregnancy to reduce the risk of maternal anemia and iron deficiency. A number of micronutrients have also been associated with pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, and nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. In general, experimental studies are necessary to demonstrate the benefits of supplementation with different micronutrients and to adjust the recommended daily doses and the recommended periconceptional nutrition for mothers. Presently, there is evidence of the benefits of micronutrient supplementation in perinatal results, but indiscriminate use is discouraged due to the fact that the side effects of excessive doses are not known. Evidence supports the idea that micronutrient deficiencies negatively affect maternal health and the outcome of pregnancy. No single micronutrient is responsible for the adverse effects; thus, supplementing or correcting one deficiency will not be very effective while other deficiencies exist.",Santander Ballestín S; Giménez Campos MI; Ballestín Ballestín J; Luesma Bartolomé MJ,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34579011/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34572997,Impact of Environmental and Lifestyle Use of Chromium on Male Fertility: Focus on Antioxidant Activity and Oxidative Stress.,"Male reproductive tissues are strongly susceptible to several environmental and lifestyle stressors. In general, male reproductive health is highly sensitive to oxidative stress, which results in reversible and/or irreversible changes in testosterone-producing cells, spermatogenesis, and sperm quality. Chromium compounds are widely used in the +3 and +6 valence states, as food supplements, and in the industrial field, respectively. Chromium (III) compounds, i.e., Cr(III)-tris-picolinate, [Cr(pic)<sub>3</sub>], known as chromium picolinate, are used as nutritional supplements for the control of diabetes, body weight, and muscular growth. However, previous studies showed that animal models exposed to chromium picolinate experienced degenerative changes in spermatogenesis. Contradictory results are documented in the literature and deserve discussion. Furthermore, the long-term effects of chromium picolinate on the antioxidant system of treated subjects have not been properly studied. Comprehensive studies on the role of this compound will help to establish the safe and useful use of chromium supplementation. On the other hand, chromium (VI) compounds are widely used in several industries, despite being well-known environmental pollutants (i.e., welding fumes). Chromium (VI) is known for its deleterious effects on male reproductive health as toxic, carcinogenic, and mutagenic. Previous studies have demonstrated severe lesions to mouse spermatogenesis after exposure to chromium (VI). However, workers worldwide are still exposed to hexavalent chromium, particularly in electronics and military industries. Data from the literature pinpoints mechanisms of oxidative stress induced by chromium compounds in somatic and germ cells that lead to apoptosis, thus underlining the impairment of fertility potential. In this review, we analyze the benefits and risks of chromium compounds on male fertility, as well as the mechanisms underlying (in)fertility outcomes. Although supplements with antioxidant properties may maximize male fertility, adverse effects need to be investigated and discussed.",Pereira SC; Oliveira PF; Oliveira SR; Pereira ML; Alves MG,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34572997/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Subsequently, identifying newer molecules with lipid-lowering effects is necessary. A great deal of attention has been given in recent years to fiber supplements, e.g., guar gum. Thus, we screened and evaluated the quality of the evidence regarding the benefits of guar gum supplementation in T2DM and conducted a meta-analysis to assess the effects of this compound on serum lipids in T2DM. We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar and Embase, from the inception of these databases until January 2021. In total, 11 papers were included based on the eligible criteria in our meta-analysis. The meta-analysis of the eligible trials demonstrated a significant reduction of total cholesterol (TC) (WMD: -20.32 mg/dL, 95% CI: -27.02, -13.62, P < 0.001) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (WMD: -14.52 mg/dL, 95% CI: -20.69, -8.35, P < 0.001) following guar gum supplementation in T2DM patients. The subgroup analysis based on the dosage (g/day) of this compound revealed that ≥20 g/day of guar gum led to a notable decrease in triglyceride (TG) levels (WMD: -12.55 mg/dL, 95% CI: -23.72, -1.37, P = 0.02) versus < 20 g/day (WMD: -1.84 mg/dL, 95% CI: -32.18, 28.49, P = 0.90). Guar gum supplementation had no effects on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (WMD: 0.66 mg/dL, 95% CI: -0.95, 2.28, P = 0.42). Guar gum consumption has lipid-lowering effects when administered to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and it is particularly able to reduce TC, LDL-C and TG levels.

34537990,"Vitamin D, respiratory infections, and chronic disease: Review of meta-analyses and randomized clinical trials.","Observational studies have suggested associations of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) with respiratory tract infections, impaired bone health, and myriad chronic diseases. To assess potential causal relationships between vitamin D supplementation and a reduced risk of these conditions, a review of the evidence across available meta-analyses of randomized control trials (RCTs) and RCTs was performed. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched from their inception to March 2021. We included only RCTs and meta-analyses of RCTs focusing on the association between vitamin D and respiratory disease, bone health, cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes mellitus, and cancer. A total of 107 RCTs and 62 meta-analysis of RCTs were included. Although most RCTs did not support benefits of vitamin D supplementation, suggestive evidence for benefit was found in populations at greater risk of VDD and for acute respiratory infections, fractures in institutionalized older adults, type 2 diabetes among patients with prediabetes, and cancer mortality. In contrast, no compelling evidence for benefit was found for other respiratory conditions, fractures in community-dwelling adults, falls, cancer incidence, or CVD. Current evidence from RCTs and meta-analyses of RCTs is inconsistent regarding the effects of vitamin D supplementation on respiratory infections and chronic diseases. Individuals most likely to benefit are those with baseline VDD or with selected high-risk conditions. Public health initiatives are needed to eliminate VDD globally, and future research will be enhanced by a 'precision prevention' approach to identify those most likely to benefit from vitamin D supplementation.",Ganmaa D; Enkhmaa D; Nasantogtokh E; Sukhbaatar S; Tumur-Ochir KE; Manson JE,Journal of internal medicine,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34537990/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34533234,Nutritional significance and therapeutic potential of Moringa oleifera: The wonder plant.,"Moringa oleifera is a multi-purpose plant and a comprehensive source of dietary components such as proteins, essential amino acids, vitamins, antioxidants, etc. The plant is also a rich source of other bioactive components, including flavonoids, glucosinolates, isothiocyanates, alkaloids, terpenoids, phenolics, etc. Incorporating M. oleifera in diet can improve the nutritional status of pregnant and nursing mothers and helps to combat malnutrition and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) among children. The phytochemicals and secondary metabolites, especially the polyphenolic compounds from Moringa, have a significant free-radical scavenging effect attributed to this plant's therapeutic potential. Investigations targeting to explore M. oleifera for its nutritional makeup, novel bioactive components, and analysis of their health-promoting attributes have received much attention. This review demonstrates an overview of recent (past ten years) advancements and patenting activity in discovering different parts of M. oleifera plant for providing adequate nutritive and bioactive components. The pharmacological potential and action mechanisms of M. oleifera in many diseases like diabetes mellitus, cancer, hypertension, ulcer, etc., are also discussed. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Moringa oleifera is a vital plant that has a varied set of nutritional and therapeutic properties. The indigenous components of Moringa can treat humankind of its diseases and contribute to overall health. The qualitative and functional characteristics of its components indicate possible commercial exploitation of this high-value plant by utilizing its plant parts in many proprietary medicines and nutraceuticals. In conclusion, the Moringa plant needs to be used commercially. It can lead to tremendous economic development if the industries and researchers exploit its potential for highly nutritional super food and therapeutic application by undertaking further research to corroborate earlier studies.",Arora S; Arora S,Journal of food biochemistry,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34533234/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34521329,Effects of Alpha-lipoic Acid Supplementation on Human Diabetic Nephropathy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is kidney dysfunction, which occurs due to elevated urine albumin excretion rate and reduced glomerular filtration rate. Studies on animals have shown that alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) supplementation can reduce the development of DN. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the effects of ALA supplementation on biological indices (albumin, creatinine, etc.) indicative of human DN. The search procedure included PubMed Central, Embase, Cochrane Library (trials), and Web of Science (protocol registration: INPLASY202060095). We found that ALA supplementation decreased 24h urine albumin excretion rate in patients with diabetes (standardized mean difference=-2.27; confidence interval (CI)=(-4.09)-(-0.45); I<sup>2</sup>=98%; Z=2.44; p=0.01). A subgroup analysis revealed that the results of studies examining only ALA did not differ from those examined ALA in combination with additional medicines (Chisquared= 0.19; p=0.66; I<sup>2</sup>=0%), while neither ALA nor ALA plus medication had an effect on 24h urine albumin excretion rate (p>0.05). Also, ALA supplementation decreased urine albumin mg/l (mean difference (MD)=-12.95; CI=(-23.88)-(-2.02); I<sup>2</sup>=44%; Z=2.32; p=0.02) and urine albumin to creatinine ratio (MD=-26.96; CI=(-35.25)-(-18.67); I<sup>2</sup>=0%; Z=6.37; p<0.01) in patients with diabetes. When the studies examining ALA plus medication were excluded, it was found that ALA supplementation had no effect on urine albumin mg/l (p>0.05) but did significantly decrease urine albumin to creatinine ratio (MD=-25.88, CI=(34.40-(-17.36), I<sup>2</sup>=0%, Z=5.95, p<0.00001). The available evidence suggests that ALA supplementation does not improve biological indices that reflect DN in humans.

34496412,Effects of Melatonin Supplementation on Insulin Levels and Insulin Resistance: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"Insulin resistance (IR) is a pivotal process in various metabolic diseases. The well-known treatment is lifestyle modification and medication therapy, which may result in poor compliance and side effects. Melatonin has been suggested to have a role in glucose metabolism, yet the results across studies have been inconsistent. Therefore, we performed a systematic review to evaluate the effects of melatonin supplementation on insulin levels and IR. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov, and identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published prior to August 2020. Articles were reviewed, selected and extracted by two reviewers independently. In total, 8 RCTs of 376 participants were included. Data were pooled using a random-effects model, with mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Our results showed that melatonin administration significantly reduced insulin levels and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and increased the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI). We conclude that melatonin ameliorated hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and insulin sensitivity, and the results are an update of a previous meta-analysis. Although more investigations are required, we clearly provide evidence for the use of melatonin as an adjuvant treatment for metabolic disorders involving IR.",Li Y; Xu Z,Hormone and metabolic research = Hormon- und Stoffwechselforschung = Hormones et metabolisme,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34496412/,0,1,0,1,0,0
34473618,Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation in Type 2 Diabetes Patients with Tuberculosis: A Systematic Review.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) and tuberculosis (TB) have been recognized as reemerging epidemics, especially in developing countries. Among all the risk factors, diabetes causes immunosuppression, increasing the risk of active TB three times. Vitamin D has been found as a link between DM-TB co-morbidity. Vitamin D affects the immune response, suppresses Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) growth, and affects insulin secretion. The present systematic review determines the effect of vitamin D supplementation on clinical and therapeutic outcomes of DM-TB patients. A comprehensive literature search was carried out in PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus database to determine eligible studies from inception to January 2021. Out of the 639 articles retrieved, three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the systematic review. The effect of vitamin D3 or oral cholecalciferol supplementation was assessed on outcomes, such as duration to sputum smear conversion, TB scores improvement, change in glycemic parameters, including HbA1c, FBS, and PLBS, and laboratory parameters, such as Hb, ESR, and CRP. Duration of sputum smear conversion was decreased by two weeks in the vitamin D3 supplemented group in two studies. TB score improvement and changes in glycemic parameters were inclined towards supplemented group; however, they were not significant. The overall effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on TB patients with DM was not significant. Further studies are required in the future examining the effect of supplementation on outcomes in this population.",Patel DG; Kurian SJ; Miraj SS; Rashid M; Thomas L; Rodrigues GS; Banerjee M; Khandelwal B; Saravu K; Rao M,Current diabetes reviews,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34473618/,0,1,0,0,0,0
34472150,Effect of resveratrol on C-reactive protein: An updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"We conducted a meta-analysis on the available randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to assess the role of resveratrol in lowering C-reactive protein (CRP) and high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) levels, as markers of inflammation, in various inflammatory disorders. Literature search through Medline/PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and Cochrane Library yielded 35 RCTs (24 studies for hs-CRP and 11 studies for CRP). Pooled results revealed that resveratrol supplementation significantly reduced the hs-CRP (MWD = -0.40 mg/L; 95% CI: -0.70 to -0.09 mg/L; p = .01) and CRP (MWD = -0.31 mg/L; 95% CI: -0.47 to -0.15 mg/L; p < .001) levels in serum. Subgroup analysis revealed that resveratrol in group with ≥10 weeks significantly reduces hs-CRP levels (MWD = -0.48 mg/L; 95% CI: -0.92 to -0.04 mg/L; p = .03) and CRP (WMD = -0.47 mg/L, 95% CI = -0.69 to -0.25, p < .001). A dose of ≥500 mg/day supplementation improves the levels of CRP, but not hs-CRP. This meta-analysis demonstrates that resveratrol consumption is effective in lowering the levels of CRP and hs-CRP in inflammatory conditions, especially if supplementation takes place for ≥10 weeks with ≥500 mg/day.",Gorabi AM; Aslani S; Imani D; Razi B; Sathyapalan T; Sahebkar A,Phytotherapy research : PTR,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34472150/,0,1,0,1,0,0
34467577,The effect of Gymnema sylvestre supplementation on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to find the effect of Gymnema sylvestre (GS) supplementation on glycemic control in type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). PubMed, Cochrane library, Google Scholar, and Science Direct were searched from inception to June 2020 to identify the studies that reported GS supplementation on glycemic parameters. Standardized mean difference (SMD) was calculated by comparing the post-intervention data with baseline data. SMDs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using a random-effects model. Our meta-analysis consisting of 10 studies with a total of 419 participants showed that GS supplementation significantly reduces fasting blood glucose (FBG) (SMD 1.57 mg/dl, 95% CI 2.22 to -0.93, p < .0001, I<sup>2</sup> 90%), postprandial blood glucose (PPBG) (SMD 1.04 mg/dl, 95% CI 1.53 to -0.54, p < .0001, I<sup>2</sup> 80%), and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (SMD 3.91, 95% CI 7.35 to -0.16%, p < .0001, I<sup>2</sup> 99%) compared to baseline. Further, our study also found that GS significantly reduces triglycerides (SMD 1.81 mg/dl, 95% CI 2.95 to -0.66, p < .0001, I<sup>2</sup> : 96%), and total cholesterol (SMD 4.10 mg/dl, 95% CI 7.21 to -0.99, p < .0001, I<sup>2</sup> : 98%) compared to baseline. Our study shows that GS supplementation is effective in improving glycemic control and reducing lipid levels in T2DM patients and suggests that such supplementation might be used as an effective therapy for the management of T2DM and its associated complications to an extent.",Devangan S; Varghese B; Johny E; Gurram S; Adela R,Phytotherapy research : PTR,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34467577/,0,1,0,1,0,0
34448953,Molecular Aspects in the Potential of Vitamins and Supplements for Treating Diabetic Neuropathy.,"To discuss and provide evidence-based data on dietary supplements as part of treating diabetic neuropathy RECENT FINDINGS: Few randomized controlled trials are available, but some have shown beneficial efficacy of various dietary supplements on objective primary endpoints including nerve conduction velocities and axon potentials as well as subjective patient-reported outcomes. No medical cure for diabetic neuropathy exists, and prevention is therefore crucial. Tight glucose control slows the progression of nerve damage in diabetes, but an unmet clinical need for effective interventions is warranted. Consequently, a growing number of patients turn to dietary supplements proposed to possess neuroprotective properties. However, the postulated effects are often not evidence-based as they have not been tested scientifically. Taken together, this review will focus on dietary supplements investigated in clinical trials for their potential capabilities in targeting the molecular mechanisms involved in the underlying pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy.",Okdahl T; Brock C,Current diabetes reports,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34448953/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34445765,Bioactive Peptides as Potential Nutraceuticals for Diabetes Therapy: A Comprehensive Review.,"Diabetes mellitus is a major public health concern associated with high mortality and reduced life expectancy. The alarming rise in the prevalence of diabetes is linked to several factors including sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy diet. Nutritional intervention and increased physical activity could significantly contribute to bringing this under control. Food-derived bioactive peptides and protein hydrolysates have been associated with a number health benefits. Several peptides with antidiabetic potential have been identified that could decrease blood glucose level, improve insulin uptake and inhibit key enzymes involved in the development and progression of diabetes. Dietary proteins, from a wide range of food, are rich sources of antidiabetic peptides. Thus, there are a number of benefits in studying peptides obtained from food sources to develop nutraceuticals. A deeper understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of these peptides will assist in the development of new peptide-based therapeutics. Despite this, a comprehensive analysis of the antidiabetic properties of bioactive peptides derived from various food sources is still lacking. Here, we review the recent literature on food-derived bioactive peptides possessing antidiabetic activity. The focus is on the effectiveness of these peptides as evidenced by in vitro and in vivo studies. Finally, we discuss future prospects of peptide-based drugs for the treatment of diabetes.",Antony P; Vijayan R,International journal of molecular sciences,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34445765/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34445238,"Selenium Deficiency Due to Diet, Pregnancy, Severe Illness, or COVID-19-A Preventable Trigger for Autoimmune Disease.","The trace element selenium (Se) is an essential part of the human diet; moreover, increased health risks have been observed with Se deficiency. A sufficiently high Se status is a prerequisite for adequate immune response, and preventable endemic diseases are known from areas with Se deficiency. Biomarkers of Se status decline strongly in pregnancy, severe illness, or COVID-19, reaching critically low concentrations. Notably, these conditions are associated with an increased risk for autoimmune disease (AID). Positive effects on the immune system are observed with Se supplementation in pregnancy, autoimmune thyroid disease, and recovery from severe illness. However, some studies reported null results; the database is small, and randomized trials are sparse. The current need for research on the link between AID and Se deficiency is particularly obvious for rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Despite these gaps in knowledge, it seems timely to realize that severe Se deficiency may trigger AID in susceptible subjects. Improved dietary choices or supplemental Se are efficient ways to avoid severe Se deficiency, thereby decreasing AID risk and improving disease course. A personalized approach is needed in clinics and during therapy, while population-wide measures should be considered for areas with habitual low Se intake. Finland has been adding Se to its food chain for more than 35 years-a wise and commendable decision, according to today's knowledge. It is unfortunate that the health risks of Se deficiency are often neglected, while possible side effects of Se supplementation are exaggerated, leading to disregard for this safe and promising preventive and adjuvant treatment options. This is especially true in the follow-up situations of pregnancy, severe illness, or COVID-19, where massive Se deficiencies have developed and are associated with AID risk, long-lasting health impairments, and slow recovery.",Schomburg L,International journal of molecular sciences,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34445238/,1,0,0,0,0,1
34444981,"The Impact of Lifestyle, Diet and Physical Activity on Epigenetic Changes in the Offspring-A Systematic Review.","This systematic review examines the association between maternal lifestyle, diet and physical activity, and epigenetic changes in the offspring. A literature search was conducted using multiple science databases: PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library, on 10 March 2021. RCT and Cohort studies in English or Scandinavian languages were included. Exposure variables included diet, lifestyle, meal patterns or physical activity. Studies using dietary supplements as exposure variables were excluded. Outcome variables included were DNA methylation, microRNA or histone changes in placenta, cord blood or offspring. Two independent authors screened, read and extracted data from the included papers. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB2) and The Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) Cohort Study Checklist were used to assess risk of bias in the included studies. A qualitative approach was employed due to heterogeneity of exposures and results of the studies. 16 studies and 3617 participants were included in the final analysis. The exposure variables included physical activity, carbohydrate, low glycemic index diet, added sugar, fat, Mediterranean diet and pro-inflammatory diet. The outcome variables identified were differences in DNA methylation and microRNA. Most studies described epigenetic changes in either placenta or cord blood. Genes reported to be methylated were GR, HSD2, IGF-2, PLAG1, MEG-3, H19 and RXRA. However, not all studies found epigenetic changes strong enough to pass multiple testing, and the study quality varied. Despite the variable quality of the included studies, the results in this review suggest that there may be an association between the mother's lifestyle, diet and level of physical activity during pregnancy and epigenetic changes in the offspring.",Rasmussen L; Knorr S; Antoniussen CS; Bruun JM; Ovesen PG; Fuglsang J; Kampmann U,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34444981/,0,1,0,0,0,0

Guidelines consistently suggest reducing energy intake to counteract the obesity epidemic, frequently resulting in sarcopenic obesity, a condition associated with poorer metabolic control and cardiovascular disease. Various dietary approaches have been proposed with largely similar results, with a preference for the Mediterranean diet and the best practice being the diet that patients feel confident of maintaining in the long term based on individual preferences. Patient adherence is indeed the pivotal factor for weight loss and long-term maintenance, requiring intensive lifestyle intervention. The consumption of nutritional supplements continues to increase even if international societies do not support their systematic use. Inositols and vitamin D supplementation, as well as micronutrients (zinc, chromium, magnesium) and pre/probiotics, result in modest improvement in insulin sensitivity, but their use is not systematically suggested. To reach the desired goals, patients should be actively involved in the collaborative development of a personalised meal plan associated with habitual physical activity, aiming at normal body weight and metabolic control.",Petroni ML; Brodosi L; Marchignoli F; Sasdelli AS; Caraceni P; Marchesini G; Ravaioli F,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34444908/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34444864,Nutritional Supplements and Neuroprotective Diets and Their Potential Clinical Significance in Post-Stroke Rehabilitation.,"Nutrition and rehabilitation are crucial in post-stroke recovery, especially in the elderly. Since stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability, there is a need to promote special, individually tailored nutrition strategies targeting older patients with low motor ability. Chronic stroke survivors have higher risk of developing nutrition-related chronic diseases, such as sarcopenia, anemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus and osteoporosis. Moreover, reduced motor activity, cognitive impairment and depression might be aggravated by poor malnutrition status. Accumulated data suggest that nutritional supplements and neuroprotective diets can be associated with better effectiveness of post-stroke rehabilitation as well as brain recovery. Therefore, this review focuses on preventive strategies that can improve dietary intake and change dietary patterns. We highlight the importance of neuroprotective diets, the problem of dysphagia and the role of nutrition in rehabilitation. This article focuses on potential nutritional supplements and neuroprotective diets that may have an impact on functional recovery during and after rehabilitation. Moreover, a new approach to post-stroke neuroplasticity including the use of agents from marine sources such as fucoxanthin and tramiprosate as compounds that might be used as potential neuroprotectants with antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties is introduced.",Zielińska-Nowak E; Cichon N; Saluk-Bijak J; Bijak M; Miller E,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34444864/,1,0,0,0,0,0

This systematic review summarizes information on the impact of brown seaweeds or components on inflammation, and inflammation-related pathologies, such as allergies, diabetes mellitus and obesity. We focus on oral supplementation thus intending the use of brown seaweeds as food additives. Despite the great diversity of experimental systems in which distinct species and compounds were tested for their effects on inflammation and immunity, a remarkably homogeneous picture arises. The predominant effects of consumption of brown seaweeds or compounds can be classified into three categories: (1) inhibition of reactive oxygen species, known to be important drivers of inflammation; (2) regulation, i.e., in most cases inhibition of proinflammatory NF-κB signaling; (3) modulation of adaptive immune responses, in particular by interfering with T-helper cell polarization. Over the last decades, several inflammation-related diseases have increased substantially. These include allergies and autoimmune diseases as well as morbidities associated with lifestyle and aging. In this light, further development of brown seaweeds and seaweed compounds as functional foods and nutriceuticals might contribute to combat these challenges.",Olsthoorn SEM; Wang X; Tillema B; Vanmierlo T; Kraan S; Leenen PJM; Mulder MT,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34444774/,0,1,0,0,0,0

34371951,A Systematic Review of Carotenoids in the Management of Diabetic Retinopathy.,"Diabetic retinopathy, which was primarily regarded as a microvascular disease, is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. With obesity at epidemic proportions, diabetes-related ocular problems are exponentially increasing in the developed world. Oxidative stress due to hyperglycemic states and its associated inflammation is one of the pathological mechanisms which leads to depletion of endogenous antioxidants in retina in a diabetic patient. This contributes to a cascade of events that finally leads to retinal neurodegeneration and irreversible vision loss. The xanthophylls lutein and zeaxanthin are known to promote retinal health, improve visual function in retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration that has oxidative damage central in its etiopathogenesis. Thus, it can be hypothesized that dietary supplements with xanthophylls that are potent antioxidants may regenerate the compromised antioxidant capacity as a consequence of the diabetic state, therefore ultimately promoting retinal health and visual improvement. We performed a comprehensive literature review of the National Library of Medicine and Web of Science databases, resulting in 341 publications meeting search criteria, of which, 18 were found eligible for inclusion in this review. Lutein and zeaxanthin demonstrated significant protection against capillary cell degeneration and hyperglycemia-induced changes in retinal vasculature. Observational studies indicate that depletion of xanthophyll carotenoids in the macula may represent a novel feature of DR, specifically in patients with type 2 or poorly managed type 1 diabetes. Meanwhile, early interventional trials with dietary carotenoid supplementation show promise in improving their levels in serum and macular pigments concomitant with benefits in visual performance. These findings provide a strong molecular basis and a line of evidence that suggests carotenoid vitamin therapy may offer enhanced neuroprotective effects with therapeutic potential to function as an adjunct nutraceutical strategy for management of diabetic retinopathy.",Lem DW; Gierhart DL; Davey PG,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34371951/,0,1,0,0,0,0

34371867,Folic Acid Supplementation Improves Glycemic Control for Diabetes Prevention and Management: A Systematic Review and Dose-Response Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"There is a growing interest in the considerable benefits of dietary supplementations, such as folic acid, on the glycemic profile. We aimed to investigate the effects of folic acid supplementation on glycemic control markers in adults. Randomized controlled trials examining the effects of folic acid supplementation on glycemic control markers published up to March 2021 were detected by searching online databases, including Scopus, PubMed, Embase, and ISI web of science, using a combination of related keywords. Mean change and standard deviation (SD) of the outcome measures were used to estimate the mean difference between the intervention and control groups at follow-up. Meta-regression and non-linear dose-response analysis were conducted to evaluate the association between pooled effect size and folic acid dosage (mg/day) and duration of the intervention (week). From 1814 detected studies, twenty-four studies reported fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin, hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), and Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) as an outcome measure. Results revealed significant reductions in FBG (weighted mean difference (WMD): -2.17 mg/dL, 95% CI: -3.69, -0.65, <i>p</i> = 0.005), fasting insulin (WMD: -1.63 pmol/L, 95% CI: -2.53, -0.73, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and HOMA-IR (WMD: -0.40, 95% CI: -0.70, -0.09, <i>p</i> = 0.011) following folic acid supplementation. No significant effect was detected for HbA1C (WMD: -0.27%, 95% CI: -0.73, 0.18, <i>p</i> = 0.246). The dose-response analysis showed that folic acid supplementation significantly changed HOMA-IR (r = -1.30, p-nonlinearity = 0.045) in non-linear fashion. However, meta-regression analysis did not indicate a linear relationship between dose, duration, and absolute changes in FBG, HOMA-IR, and fasting insulin concentrations. Folic acid supplementation significantly reduces some markers of glycemic control in adults. These reductions were small, which may limit clinical applications for adults with type II diabetes.

Have a Role against Nutritional Disorders? An Overview of the In Vitro and In Vivo Evidence.","Functional clinical nutrition is an integrative science; it uses dietary strategies, functional foods and medicinal plants, as well as combinations thereof. Both functional foods and medicinal plants, whether associated or not, form nutraceuticals, which can bring benefits to health, in addition to being included in the prevention and treatment of diseases. Some functional food effects from <i>Avena sativa</i> L. (oats), <i>Linum usitatissimum</i> L. (brown flaxseed), <i>Glycine max</i> L. (soya) and <i>Moringa oleifera</i> have been proposed for nutritional disorders through in vitro and in vivo tests. A formulation called a bioactive food compound (BFC) showed efficiency in the association of oats, flaxseed and soy for dyslipidemia and obesity. In this review, we discuss the effects of BFC in other nutritional disorders, as well as the beneficial effects of <i>M. oleifera</i> in obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, metabolic syndrome, intestinal inflammatory diseases/colorectal carcinogenesis and malnutrition. In addition, we hypothesized that a BFC enriched with <i>M. oleifera</i> could present a synergistic effect and play a potential benefit in nutritional disorders. The traditional consumption of <i>M. oleifera</i> preparations can allow associations with other formulations, such as BFC. These nutraceutical formulations can be easily accepted and can be used in sweet preparations (fruit and/or vegetable juices, fruit and/or vegetable vitamins, porridges, yogurt, cream, mousses or fruit salads, cakes and cookies) or savory (vegetable purees, soups, broths and various sauces), cooked or not. These formulations can be low-cost and easy-to-use. The association of bioactive food substances in dietary formulations can facilitate adherence to consumption and, thus, contribute to the planning of future nutritional interventions for the prevention and adjuvant treatment of the clinical conditions presented in this study. This can be extended to the general population. However, an investigation through clinical studies is needed to prove applicability in humans.",Ferreira RDS; Mendonça LABM; Santos CD; Hiane PA; Matias R; Franco OL; de Oliveira AKM; do Nascimento VA; Pott A; Carvalho CME; Guimarães RCA,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34371804/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34360538,Diabetes Mellitus and Cardiovascular Diseases: Nutraceutical Interventions Related to Caloric Restriction.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are closely associated and represent a key public health problem worldwide. An excess of adipose tissue, NAFLD, and gut dysbiosis establish a vicious circle that leads to chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. Caloric restriction (CR) is the most promising nutritional approach capable of improving cardiometabolic health. However, adherence to CR represents a barrier to patients and is the primary cause of therapeutic failure. To overcome this problem, many different nutraceutical strategies have been designed. Based on several data that have shown that CR action is mediated by AMPK/SIRT1 activation, several nutraceutical compounds capable of activating AMPK/SIRT1 signaling have been identified. In this review, we summarize recent data on the possible role of berberine, resveratrol, quercetin, and L-carnitine as CR-related nutrients. Additionally, we discuss the limitations related to the use of these nutrients in the management of T2DM and CVD.",Senesi P; Ferrulli A; Luzi L; Terruzzi I,International journal of molecular sciences,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34360538/,1,0,0,0,0,0

34343287,Challenges and Opportunities for Osteoporosis Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has both directly and indirectly affected osteoporosis diagnosis and treatment throughout the world. This mini-review summarizes the available evidence regarding the effects of COVID-19, its treatment, and the consequences of the pandemic itself on bone health. Additionally, we review evidence and expert recommendations regarding putative effects of osteoporosis medications on COVID-19 outcomes and vaccine efficacy and summarize recommendations for continuation of osteoporosis treatment during the pandemic. The use of standard screening procedures to assess for osteoporosis and fracture risk declined dramatically early in the pandemic, while rates of fragility fractures were largely unchanged. COVID-19, its treatments, and public health measures to prevent viral spread are each likely to negatively affect bone health. Osteoporosis treatments are not known to increase risk of adverse events from COVID-19, and preclinical data suggest possible beneficial effects of some therapies. Vitamin D deficiency is clearly associated with adverse outcomes from COVID-19, but it remains unclear whether vitamin D supplementation may improve outcomes. Osteoporosis treatment should be continued whenever possible, and recommendations for substituting therapies, if required, are available. The COVID-19 pandemic has decreased screening and disrupted treatment for osteoporosis. Osteoporosis medications are safe and effective during the pandemic and should be continued whenever possible. Further studies are needed to fully understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on long-term bone health.",Cromer SJ; Yu EW,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34343287/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34333586,Effect of Carnosine or β-Alanine Supplementation on Markers of Glycemic Control and Insulin Resistance in Humans and Animals: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"There is growing evidence that supplementation with carnosine, or its rate-limiting precursor β-alanine, can ameliorate aspects of metabolic dysregulation that occur in diabetes and its related conditions. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of carnosine or β-alanine supplementation on markers of glycemic control and insulin resistance in humans and animals. We performed a systematic search of 6 electronic databases up to 31 December 2020. Primary outcomes were changes in 1) fasting glucose, 2) glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and 3) 2-h glucose following a glucose-tolerance test. A set of additional outcomes included fasting insulin and homeostatic model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-β) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) 2.0 (human studies) and the Systematic Review Center for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) RoB (animal studies) tools; and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess certainty. We used Bayesian hierarchical random-effects models, with informative priors for human data and noninformative priors for animal data. Inferences were made on posterior samples generated by Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo using 90% credible intervals (90% CrI) and calculated probabilities. Twenty studies (n = 4 human, n = 16 rodent) were included, providing data for 2 primary outcomes (fasting glucose and HbA1c) and 3 additional outcomes (fasting insulin, HOMA-β, and HOMA-IR). The model provides evidence that supplementation decreases fasting glucose [humans: mean difference (MD)0.5 = -0.95 mmol · L-1 (90% CrI: -2.1, 0.08); rodent: MD0.5 = -2.26 mmol · L-1 (90% CrI: -4.03, -0.44)], HbA1c [humans: MD0.5 = -0.91% (90% CrI: -1.46, -0.39); rodents: MD0.5 = -1.05% (90% CrI: -1.64, -0.52)], HOMA-IR [humans: standardized mean difference (SMD)0.5 = -0.41 (90% CrI: -0.82, -0.07); rodents: SMD0.5 = -0.63 (90% CrI: -1.98, 0.65)], and fasting insulin [humans: SMD0.5 = -0.41 (90% CrI: -0.77, -0.07)]. GRADE assessment showed our certainty in the effect estimate of each outcome to be moderate (human outcomes) or very low (rodent outcomes). Supplementation with carnosine or β-alanine may reduce fasting glucose, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR in humans and rodents, and fasting insulin in humans; both compounds show potential as therapeutics to improve glycemic control and insulin resistance.

34331690,The Effect of Curcumin in Improving Lipid Profile in Patients with Cardiovascular Risk Factors: A Systematic Review of Clinical Trials.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of death worldwide. Lipid abnormalities are one of the major risk factors for CVD. Curcumin is a natural polyphenol with lipid-lowering properties. Therefore, we carried out a systematic review to summarize the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of curcumin on lipid profile in patients at risk of CVD. A comprehensive systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar up to March 1, 2020, to identify controlled clinical trials assessing the effects of curcumin on lipid profile in patients at risk of CVD. From 1051 initially identified studies, 22 met the eligibility criteria. Curcumin supplementation significantly reduced at least one of the lipid profile indices (triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol) in 15 studies and improved more than one index in five studies. However, curcumin had no effect on any of lipid profile indices in seven studies. Overall, studies using a bioavailable formulation of curcumin had a better impact on the lipid profile. The findings of this systematic review showed that curcumin supplementation significantly reduced at least one of the lipid profile indices in more than two-thirds of the included studies. Curcumin might be used as an accessible, inexpensive, and safe agent to reduce risk of CVD. More randomized, clinical controlled trials are needed to verify these results.",Rafiee S; Bagherniya M; Askari G; Sathyapalan T; Jamialahmadi T; Sahebkar A,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34331690/,0,1,0,0,0,0

There is growing evidence that curcumin could affect various anthropometric indices. We performed a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy of curcumin supplementation on anthropometric indices in obese and overweight individuals. A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar from inception up to February 2020 to identify randomized controlled trials investigating the effect of curcumin supplementation on anthropometric indices including body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), arm circumference (AC), waist-hip ratio (WHR), total body fat (TBF), and visceral fat (VF) in obese and overweight individuals. The Jadad scale was used to assess the quality of the included studies. Twenty-eight randomized controlled trials, comprising 2168 participants, were included in the systematic review. The results of 16 papers indicated that curcumin reduced at least one of the anthropometric indices among individuals with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Nevertheless, 12 articles showed that curcumin supplementation was not effective in any of the measured anthropometric factors. The included trials exhibited substantial heterogeneity in terms of the treatment protocol, follow-up duration, curcumin dosage, and background diseases of the participants. Clinical trials that have independently examined the effects of curcumin in obese or overweight individuals are limited. However, available studies indicate that curcumin has beneficial impacts on various anthropometric indices. Further trials with longer duration of interventions are needed to confirm these findings.",Safari Z; Bagherniya M; Askari G; Sathyapalan T; Sahebkar A,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34331687/,0,1,0,0,0,1

Human microbiome-based research contemplates the possibility of selecting and administering specific commensal bacterial strains to modulate the gut microbiota to attain favorable outcomes to the therapies. Consumption of probiotics and probiotic-based dietary supplements as functional foods has been a promising treatment strategy against various diseases. Clinical studies demonstrate that probiotic administration alters gut microbiota composition and instigates immune modulation in the host. The benefits of probiotics are reported to be strain-specific and depend on the host's baseline immune competence. This review explores the role of probiotics in alleviating symptoms of allergy, cancer, cardio vascular (CV) diseases, diabetes mellitus (DM), bowel diseases (IBD and IBS), periodontal disease, diseases affecting liver and kidney, neuroinflammatory diseases, and viral infections. Also, it surveyed the broad spectrum bioactive compounds produced by probiotics and possible mechanisms that trigger the immune system.",Varsha KK; Maheshwari AP; Nampoothiri KM,Clinical nutrition ESPEN,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34330476/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We aimed to provide an overview of the effects of resveratrol supplementation, in comparison to control groups, for the management of cardiometabolic risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), metabolic syndrome (MetS), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). PubMed, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science were searched from inception to May 2021. For each meta-analysis, the mean difference and its 95% CI were recalculated using a random-effects model. The certainty of evidence was rated using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. We identified 11 meta-analyses corresponding to 29 outcomes in 1476 individuals with T2D, 17 meta-analyses reporting 26 outcomes in 727 participants with the MetS, and 10 meta-analyses reporting 24 outcomes in 271 patients with NAFLD. Resveratrol supplementation had beneficial effects on some outcomes such as blood pressure, lipid profile, glycemic control, and insulin resistance in T2D, waist circumference in MetS, and body-weight and inflammation markers in NAFLD; however, for almost all outcomes, the magnitude of the effect was trivial, the certainty of evidence was very low to low, or the number of trials was too few. In the case of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), there was evidence that resveratrol can exert favorable and clinically important effects in the short term (<12 wk; mean difference: -1.05%, 95% CI: -2.09%, -0.02%; n = 6; GRADE = moderate). Current evidence does not support supplementation with resveratrol for the management of cardiometabolic risk factors in patients with T2D, MetS, and NAFLD. In the case of HbA1c, subject to the limitations such as short-term follow-up and small sample size, there was a clinically important effect.

34306314,Trends in Natural Nutrients for Oxidative Stress and Cell Senescence.,"Due to the increase in the aged population and increased life expectancy, the underlying mechanisms involved in the aging process and cell senescence and the ways for modulating these processes in age-related diseases become important. One of the main mechanisms involved in aging and cell senescence, especially in the diseases related to aging, is the oxidative stress process and the following inflammation. Hence, the effects of antioxidants are highlighted in the literature due to their beneficial impacts on inhibiting telomere shortening or DNA damage and other processes related to aging and cell senescence in age-related diseases. Dietary components, foods, and dietary patterns rich in antioxidants can modulate the aging process and delay the progression of some chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. Foods high in polyphenols, vitamin C, or carotenoids, olive oil, seeds, nuts, legumes, dietary supplements such as CoQ10, and some other dietary factors are the most important nutritional sources that have high antioxidant contents which can positively affect cell senescence and disease progression. Plant dietary patterns including Mediterranean diets can also inhibit telomere shortening following oxidative damages, and this can delay cell aging and senescence in age-related diseases. Further, olive oil can inhibit protein aggregation in Alzheimer's disease. It can be concluded that nutrition can delay the process of cell senescence in age-related diseases via inhibiting oxidative and inflammatory pathways. However, more studies are needed to better clarify the underlying mechanisms of nutrition and dietary components on cell senescence, aging, and disease progression, especially those related to age.",Omidifar N; Moghadami M; Mousavi SM; Hashemi SA; Gholami A; Shokripour M; Sohrabi Z,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34306314/,1,0,0,0,0,0

This review investigates the vitamin D status (as measured by 25(OH)D and dietary intake) of the African-Caribbean population globally. A systematic review was conducted by searching key databases (PUBMED, Web of Science, Scopus) from inception until October 2019. Search terms included 'Vitamin D status' and 'African-Caribbean'. A random effects and fixed effects meta-analysis was performed by combining means and standard error of the mean. The search yielded 19 papers that included n = 5670 African-Caribbean participants from six countries. A meta-analysis found this population to have sufficient (>50 nmol/L) 25(OH)D levels at 67.8 nmol/L, 95% CI (57.9, 7.6) but poor dietary intake of vitamin D at only 3.0 µg/day, 95% CI (1.67,4.31). For those living at low latitudes 'insufficient' (as defined by study authors) 25(OH)D levels were found only in participants with type 2 diabetes and in those undergoing haemodialysis. Suboptimal dietary vitamin D intake (according to the UK recommended nutrient intake of 10 µg/day) was reported in all studies at high latitudes. Studies at lower latitudes, with lower recommended dietary intakes (Caribbean recommended dietary intake: 2.5 µg/day) found 'sufficient' intake in two out of three studies. 25(OH)D sufficiency was found in African-Caribbean populations at lower latitudes. However, at higher latitudes, 25(OH)D deficiency and low dietary vitamin D intake was prevalent.",Vearing RM; Hart KH; Darling AL; Probst Y; Olayinka AS; Mendis J; Ribeiro H; Thakur S; Mendes M; Charlton K; Lanham-New SA,European journal of clinical nutrition,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34282293/,0,1,0,1,0,0
34258685,"Computational strategies for the discovery of biological functions of health foods, nutraceuticals and cosmeceuticals: a review.","Scientific and consumer interest in healthy foods (also known as functional foods), nutraceuticals and cosmeceuticals has increased in the recent years, leading to an increased presence of these products in the market. However, the regulations across different countries that define the type of claims that may be made, and the degree of evidence required to support these claims, are rather inconsistent. Moreover, there is also controversy on the effectiveness and biological mode of action of many of these products, which should undergo an exhaustive approval process to guarantee the consumer rights. Computational approaches constitute invaluable tools to facilitate the discovery of bioactive molecules and provide biological plausibility on the mode of action of these products. Indeed, methodologies like QSAR, docking or molecular dynamics have been used in drug discovery protocols for decades and can now aid in the discovery of bioactive food components. Thanks to these approaches, it is possible to search for new functions in food constituents, which may be part of our daily diet, and help to prevent disorders like diabetes, hypercholesterolemia or obesity. In the present manuscript, computational studies applied to this field are reviewed to illustrate the potential of these approaches to guide the first screening steps and the mechanistic studies of nutraceutical, cosmeceutical and functional foods.",Carpio LE; Sanz Y; Gozalbes R; Barigye SJ,Molecular diversity,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34258685/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34242583,Nutritional intake and bone health.,"Osteoporotic or fragility fractures affect one in two women and one in five men who are older than 50. These events are associated with substantial morbidity, increased mortality, and an impaired quality of life. Recommended general measures for fragility fracture prevention include a balanced diet with an optimal protein and calcium intake and vitamin D sufficiency, together with regular weight-bearing physical exercise. In this narrative Review, we discuss the role of nutrients, foods, and dietary patterns in maintaining bone health. Much of this information comes from observational studies. Bone mineral density, microstructure-estimated bone strength, and trabecular and cortical microstructure are positively associated with total protein intake. Several studies indicate that fracture risk might be lower with a higher dietary protein intake, provided that the calcium supply is sufficient. Dairy products are a valuable source of these two nutrients. Hip fracture risk appears to be lower in consumers of dairy products, particularly fermented dairy products. Consuming less than five servings per day of fruit and vegetables is associated with a higher hip fracture risk. Adherence to a Mediterranean diet or to a prudent diet is associated with a lower fracture risk. These various nutrients and dietary patterns influence gut microbiota composition or function, or both. The conclusions of this Review emphasise the importance of a balanced diet including minerals, protein, and fruit and vegetables for bone health and in the prevention of fragility fractures.",Rizzoli R; Biver E; Brennan-Speranza TC,The lancet.

Thus, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the effect of cinnamon supplementation on liver enzymes. Relevant articles were identified through a systematic search in PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase up to September 2020. All trials assessing the effect of oral cinnamon supplementation on serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in adults were included. The pooled effect sizes were obtained using the random-effects model and expressed as mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). A total of seven original trials (nine treatment arms) involving a total of 256 subjects were included in the final analysis. The pooled analysis indicated that cinnamon supplementation had no significant effect on serum levels of ALT, AST, and ALP. However, there was a significant reduction in ALT levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (MD: -4.01 U/L; 95% CI: -6.86, -1.15) and in trials with low-dose supplementation (<1,500 mg/d), follow-up duration longer than 12 weeks, and in the elderly patients (aged>50 years). The beneficial effects of cinnamon intake were also shown in AST levels in patients with type 2 diabetes and trials with long-term follow-up (>12 weeks). Longer-term, oral cinnamon supplementation may improve serum levels of liver enzymes in patients with type 2 diabetes. Further high-quality studies are needed, especially in populations with abnormal liver enzyme levels, to firmly establish the clinical efficacy of cinnamon on liver function.",Mousavi SM; Jayedi A; Bagheri A; Zargarzadeh N; Wong A; Persad E; Akhgarjand C; Koohdani F,Phytotherapy research : PTR,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34212447/,0,1,0,1,0,1
34207664,<i>Moringa oleifera</i> Lam. in Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Plant-derived phytochemicals have been interested in as nutraceuticals for preventing the onset and progress of diabetes mellitus and its serious complications in recent years. <i>Moringa oleifera</i> Lam. is used in vegetables and in herbal medicine for its health-promoting properties against various diseases including diabetes mellitus. This study aimed to examine an effect of <i>Moringa oleifera</i> on diabetic hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia by meta-analyzing the current evidence of diabetic rodent models. Peer-reviewed studies written in English from two databases, PubMed and Embase, were searched to 30 April 2021. Studies reporting blood glucose or lipid levels in diabetic rodents with and without receiving extracts of <i>Moringa oleifera</i> were included. Forty-four studies enrolling 349 diabetic rodents treated with extracts of <i>Moringa oleifera</i> and 350 diabetic controls reported blood glucose levels. The pooled effect size was -3.92 (95% CI: -4.65 to -3.19) with a substantial heterogeneity. This effect was likely to be, at least in part, modified by the type of diabetic models. Moreover, diabetic hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia were also significantly improved in diabetic rodent models treated with <i>Moringa oleifera</i>.",Watanabe S; Okoshi H; Yamabe S; Shimada M,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34207664/,0,1,0,1,0,0
34200595,A Review of Topical and Systemic Vitamin Supplementation in Ocular Surface Diseases.,"In the homeostasis of the ocular surface, vitamins play a critical role in regulating inflammatory responses and promoting cell differentiation, development and correct function. Systemic vitamin supplementation has been available for many decades; in recent years, thanks to pharmacological advancements, topical vitamin delivery has also become available in an attempt to better treat ocular surface disease (OSD) and dry eye disease (DED). In this paper, we reviewed the current evidence on the role of vitamin supplementation in OSD and DED. We originally searched the PubMed archive, inspected the references and restricted the search to pertinent papers. The body of evidence was evaluated using the amelioration of both signs and symptoms as the outcome, when available. We found that in patients with vitamin deficiency, systemic supplementation of Vitamin A is effective in treating OSD, reducing both DED signs and symptoms. Additionally, systemic supplementation of vitamin D is useful in reducing DED symptoms and increasing tear volume. Vitamin A is also effective in reducing DED signs and symptoms when administered locally. The efficacy of supplementation with other vitamins is still not fully proven. In conclusion, the inclusion of vitamins into the treatment strategies for OSD and DED allows for better treatment customization and better outcomes in these patients.",Fogagnolo P; De Cilla' S; Alkabes M; Sabella P; Rossetti L,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34200595/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34191703,Exercise and Nutraceuticals: Eminent Approach for Diabetic Neuropathy.,"Diabetic neuropathy is an incapacitating chronic pathological condition that encompasses a large group of diseases and manifestations of nerve damage. It affects approximately 50% of patients with diabetes mellitus. Autonomic, sensory, and motor neurons are affected. Disabilities are severe, along with poor recovery and diverse pathophysiology. Physical exercise and herbal- based therapies have the potential to decrease the disabilities associated with diabetic neuropathy. Aerobic exercises like walking, weight lifting, the use of nutraceuticals and herbal extracts are found to be effective. Literature from the public domain was studied emphasizing various beneficial effects of different exercises, herbal and nutraceuticals for their therapeutic action in diabetic neuropathy. Routine exercises and administration of herbal and nutraceuticals, either the extract of plant material containing the active phytoconstituent or isolated phytoconstituent at safe concentration, have been shown to have promising positive action in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. Exercise has shown promising effects on vascular and neuronal health. It has proven to be well effective in the treatment as well as prevention of diabetic neuropathy by various novel mechanisms, including Herbal and nutraceuticals therapy. They primarily show the anti-oxidant effect, secretagogue, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and neuroprotective action. Severe adverse events are rare with these therapies.

34186099,Impact of nutraceuticals on markers of systemic inflammation: Potential relevance to cardiovascular diseases - A position paper from the International Lipid Expert Panel (ILEP).,"Inflammation is a marker of arterial disease stemming from cholesterol-dependent to -independent molecular mechanisms. In recent years, the role of inflammation in atherogenesis has been underpinned by pharmacological approaches targeting systemic inflammation that have led to a significant reduction in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Although the use of nutraceuticals to prevent CVD has largely focused on lipid-lowering (e.g, red-yeast rice and omega-3 fatty acids), there is growing interest and need, especially now in the time of coronavirus pandemic, in the use of nutraceuticals to reduce inflammatory markers, and potentially the inflammatory CVD burden, however, there is still not enough evidence to confirm this. Indeed, diet is an important lifestyle determinant of health and can influence both systemic and vascular inflammation, to varying extents, according to the individual nutraceutical constituents. Thus, the aim of this Position Paper is to provide the first attempt at recommendations on the use of nutraceuticals with effective anti-inflammatory properties.",Ruscica M; Penson PE; Ferri N; Sirtori CR; Pirro M; Mancini GBJ; Sattar N; Toth PP; Sahebkar A; Lavie CJ; Wong ND; Banach M,Progress in cardiovascular diseases,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34186099/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34159755,A Systematic Review of Dietary Supplements and Alternative Therapies for Weight Loss.,"Dietary supplements and alternative therapies are commercialized as a panacea for obesity/weight gain as a result of the minimal regulatory requirements in demonstrating efficacy. These products may indirectly undermine the value of guideline-driven obesity treatments. Included in this study is a systematic review of the literature of purported dietary supplements and alternative therapies for weight loss. A systematic review was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of dietary supplements and alternative therapies for weight loss in participants aged ≥18 years. Searches of Medline (PubMed), Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Embase (Ovid) were conducted. Risk of bias and results were summarized qualitatively. Of the 20,504 citations retrieved in the database search, 1,743 full-text articles were reviewed, 315 of which were randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of 14 purported dietary supplements, therapies, or a combination thereof. Risk of bias and sufficiency of data varied widely. Few studies (n = 52 [16.5%]) were classified as low risk and sufficient to support efficacy. Of these, only 16 (31%) noted significant pre/post intergroup differences in weight (range: 0.3-4.93 kg). Dietary supplements and alternative therapies for weight loss have a limited high-quality evidence base of efficacy.

34071548,"Evidence-Based Recommendations for an Optimal Prenatal Supplement for Women in the U.S., Part Two: Minerals.","The levels of many essential minerals decrease during pregnancy if un-supplemented, including calcium, iron, magnesium, selenium, zinc, and possibly chromium and iodine. Sub-optimal intake of minerals from preconception through pregnancy increases the risk of many pregnancy complications and infant health problems. In the U.S., dietary intake of minerals is often below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), especially for iodine and magnesium, and 28% of women develop iron deficiency anemia during their third trimester. The goal of this paper is to propose evidence-based recommendations for the optimal level of prenatal supplementation for each mineral for most women in the United States. Overall, the evidence suggests that optimal mineral supplementation can significantly reduce a wide range of pregnancy complications (including anemia, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, hyperthyroidism, miscarriage, and pre-eclampsia) and infant health problems (including anemia, asthma/wheeze, autism, cerebral palsy, hypothyroidism, intellectual disability, low birth weight, neural tube defects, preterm birth, rickets, and wheeze). An evaluation of 180 commercial prenatal supplements found that they varied widely in mineral content, often contained only a subset of essential minerals, and the levels were often below our recommendations. Therefore, there is a need to establish recommendations on the optimal level of mineral supplementation during pregnancy.",Adams JB; Sorenson JC; Pollard EL; Kirby JK; Audhya T,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34071548/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34067538,Efficacy of Bilberry and Grape Seed Extract Supplement Interventions to Improve Glucose and Cholesterol Metabolism and Blood Pressure in Different Populations-A Systematic Review of the Literature.,"Intervention with fruit extracts may lower glucose and lipid levels, as well as blood pressure. We reviewed the efficacy of bilberry and grape seed extracts to affect these outcomes across populations with varying health status, age and ethnicity, across intervention doses and durations, in 24 intervention studies with bilberry and blackcurrant (<i>n</i> = 4) and grape seed extract (<i>n</i> = 20). Bilberry and blackcurrant extract lowered average levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), at least in Chinese subjects, especially in those who were older, who were diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and who were participating in longer-term studies. We also found good evidence that across studies and in subjects with hypercholesterolemia, T2DM or metabolic syndrome, intervention with bilberry and blackcurrant extract, and to some extent grape seed extract, significantly lowered total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels after four weeks. Intervention with grape seed extract may reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure in subjects with hypertension or metabolic syndrome. Differential responsiveness in cholesterol and blood pressure outcomes between stratified populations could not be explained by age, dose or study duration. In conclusion, bilberry and blackcurrant extract appears effective in lowering HbA1c and total and LDL cholesterol, whereas grape seed extract may lower total and LDL cholesterol, and blood pressure, in specific population groups.",Grohmann T; Litts C; Horgan G; Zhang X; Hoggard N; Russell W; de Roos B,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34067538/,0,1,0,0,0,0
34065478,Food Sources of Selenium and Its Relationship with Chronic Diseases.,"Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient for mammals, and its deficiency seriously threatens human health. A series of biofortification strategies have been developed to produce Se-enriched foods for combating Se deficiency. Although there have been some inconsistent results, extensive evidence has suggested that Se supplementation is beneficial for preventing and treating several chronic diseases. Understanding the association between Se and chronic diseases is essential for guiding clinical practice, developing effective public health policies, and ultimately counteracting health issues associated with Se deficiency. The current review will discuss the food sources of Se, biofortification strategies, metabolism and biological activities, clinical disorders and dietary reference intakes, as well as the relationship between Se and health outcomes, especially cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic inflammation, cancer, and fertility. Additionally, some concepts were proposed, there is a non-linear U-shaped dose-responsive relationship between Se status and health effects: subjects with a low baseline Se status can benefit from Se supplementation, while Se supplementation in populations with an adequate or high status may potentially increase the risk of some diseases. In addition, at supra-nutritional levels, methylated Se compounds exerted more promising cancer chemo-preventive efficacy in preclinical trials.",Hu W; Zhao C; Hu H; Yin S,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34065478/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34063269,Maintenance of Skeletal Muscle to Counteract Sarcopenia in Patients with Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease and Especially Those Undergoing Hemodialysis.,"Life extension in modern society has introduced new concepts regarding such disorders as frailty and sarcopenia, which has been recognized in various studies. At the same time, cutting-edge technology methods, e.g., renal replacement therapy for conditions such as hemodialysis (HD), have made it possible to protect patients from advanced lethal chronic kidney disease (CKD). Loss of muscle and fat mass, termed protein energy wasting (PEW), has been recognized as prognostic factor and, along with the increasing rate of HD introduction in elderly individuals in Japan, appropriate countermeasures are necessary. Although their origins differ, frailty, sarcopenia, and PEW share common components, among which skeletal muscle plays a central role in their etiologies. The nearest concept may be sarcopenia, for which diagnosis techniques have recently been reported. The focus of this review is on maintenance of skeletal muscle against aging and CKD/HD, based on muscle physiology and pathology. Clinically relevant and topical factors related to muscle wasting including sarcopenia, such as vitamin D, myostatin, insulin (related to diabetes), insulin-like growth factor I, mitochondria, and physical inactivity, are discussed. Findings presented thus far indicate that in addition to modulation of the aforementioned factors, exercise combined with nutritional supplementation may be a useful approach to overcome muscle wasting and sarcopenia in elderly patients undergoing HD treatments.",Mori K,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34063269/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34057057,Mechanistic aspects of carotenoid health benefits - where are we now?,"Dietary intake and tissue levels of carotenoids have been associated with a reduced risk of several chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, obesity, brain-related diseases and some types of cancer. However, intervention trials with isolated carotenoid supplements have mostly failed to confirm the postulated health benefits. It has thereby been speculated that dosing, matrix and synergistic effects, as well as underlying health and the individual nutritional status plus genetic background do play a role. It appears that our knowledge on carotenoid-mediated health benefits may still be incomplete, as the underlying mechanisms of action are poorly understood in relation to human relevance. Antioxidant mechanisms - direct or via transcription factors such as NRF2 and NF-κB - and activation of nuclear hormone receptor pathways such as of RAR, RXR or also PPARs, via carotenoid metabolites, are the basic principles which we try to connect with carotenoid-transmitted health benefits as exemplified with described common diseases including obesity/diabetes and cancer. Depending on the targeted diseases, single or multiple mechanisms of actions may play a role.

34036101,A Novel Review of Homocysteine and Pregnancy Complications.,"Homocysteine (Hct) is a substance produced in the metabolism of methionine. It is an essential type of amino acid gained from the daily diet. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene mutation is related to elevated total homocysteine (tHct) expressions, in particular, among women with low folate intake. Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHct) is caused by numerous factors, such as genetic defects, lack of folic acid, vitamin B<sub>6</sub> and B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, hypothyroidism, drugs, aging, and renal dysfunction. Increased Hct in peripheral blood may lead to vascular illnesses, coronary artery dysfunction, atherosclerotic changes, and embolic diseases. Compared to nonpregnant women, the Hct level is lower in normal pregnancies. Recent studies have reported that HHct was associated with numerous pregnancy complications, including recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), preeclampsia (PE), preterm delivery, placental abruption, fetal growth restriction (FGR), and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Besides, it was discovered that neonatal birth weight and maternal Hct levels were negatively correlated. However, a number of these findings lack consistency. In this review, we summarized the metabolic process of Hct in the human body, the levels of Hct in different stages of normal pregnancy reported in previous studies, and the relationship between Hct and pregnancy complications. The work done is helpful for obstetricians to improve the likelihood of a positive outcome during pregnancy complications. Reducing the Hct level with a high dosage of folic acid supplements during the next pregnancy could be helpful for females who have suffered pregnancy complications due to HHct.",Dai C; Fei Y; Li J; Shi Y; Yang X,BioMed research international,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34036101/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34030674,The effects of vitamin and mineral supplementation on women with gestational diabetes mellitus.,"The effects of vitamin and mineral supplementation on women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have not been well established. We conduct a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of vitamin and mineral supplementation on glycemic control, inflammation and oxidative stress for women with GDM. A systematic search of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library up to July, 2020. Various results were pooled by using Review manager 5.3 and Stata 12.0. Mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was estimated. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed by I-squared (I<sup>2</sup>) tests. Six hundred ninety-eight patients from 12 trials were included in our meta-analysis. Magnesium, zinc, selenium, calcium, vitamin D and E (alone or in combination) were found to significantly improve glycemic control in women with GDM compared to those receiving placebos: fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (MD = - 9.02; 95% CI: - 12.09, - 5.96; P < 0.00001), serum insulin (MD = - 4.33; 95% CI: - 5.35, - 3.32; P < 0.00001), homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (MD = - 1.34; 95% CI: - 1.60, - 1.07; P < 0.00001), and homeostasis model of assessment for β cell function (HOMA-B) (MD = - 15.58; 95% CI: - 23.70, - 7.46; P = 0.0002). Vitamin and mineral supplementation was found to attenuated inflammation and oxidative stress through decreasing high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (MD = - 1.29; 95% CI: - 1.82, - 0.76; P < 0.00001), malondialdehyde (MDA) (MD = - 0.71; 95% CI: - 0.97, - 0.45; P < 0.00001), and increasing total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (MD = 45.55; 95% CI: 22.02, 69.08; P = 0.0001).

34006994,Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in obese children and adolescents: a role for nutrition?,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common cause of chronic liver disease in children, paralleling the increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide. The pathogenesis of paediatric NAFLD is not fully understood, but it is known that obesity, nutrition, lifestyle variables, genetic and epigenetic factors may be causally involved in the development of this common metabolic liver disease. In particular, obesity and nutrition are among the strongest risk factors for paediatric NAFLD, which may exert their adverse hepatic effects already before birth. Excess energy intake induces hypertrophy and hyperplasia of adipose tissue with subsequent development of systemic insulin resistance, which is another important risk factor for NAFLD. Diet composition and in particular simple carbohydrate intake (especially high fructose intake) may promote the development of NAFLD, whereas non-digestible carbohydrates (dietary fiber), by affecting gut microbiota, may favour the integrity of gut wall and reduce inflammation, opposing this process. Saturated fat intake may also promote NAFLD development, whereas unsaturated fat intake has some beneficial effects. Protein intake does not seem to affect the development of NAFLD, but further investigation is needed. In conclusion, lifestyle modifications to induce weight loss, through diet and physical activity, remain the mainstay of treatment for paediatric NAFLD. The use of dietary supplements, such as omega-3 fatty acids and probiotics, needs further study before recommendation.",Bonsembiante L; Targher G; Maffeis C,European journal of clinical nutrition,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34006994/,1,0,0,0,0,0

However, the findings of human studies are contradictory. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials to assess the effect of capsaicin administration on glycemic indices. Medline, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar were searched from the database inception to January 14, 2021. The weighted (WMD) or standardized (SMD) mean difference with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using a random-effects model. Fourteen trials were included in this study. Long-term capsaicin supplementation did not show significant effects on fasting blood glucose (WMD: 0.03 mmol L-1, 95% CI: -0.05 to 0.12, I2 = 40.5%) and fasting insulin (SMD: 0.09, 95% CI: -0.04 to 0.22, I2 = 0.0%). Short-term capsaicin supplementation had no significant effects on 2-hour postprandial blood glucose (WMD: 0.06 mmol L-1, 95% CI: -0.34 to 0.47, I2 = 92.5%) and 2-hour postprandial insulin (WMD: 1.70 μIU mL-1, 95% CI: -3.46 to 6.86, I2 = 72.4%). Subgroup analysis revealed that the dose and ingestion form of capsaicin could be sources of between-study heterogeneity.

33984490,Does vitamin C supplementation exert profitable effects on serum lipid profile in patients with type 2 diabetes? A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis.,"Previous studies have reported that vitamin C supplementation may decrease lipid profile in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the influence of vitamin C supplementation on lipid profile in patients with T2DM. Studies examining the effects of vitamin C supplementation on lipid profile in patients with T2DM, published up to November 2020, were identified through PubMed, SCOPUS, and Embase databases. 15 studies, including 872 participants, were included and analyzed using a random-effects model to calculate weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Findings from 15 studies indicated that vitamin C supplementation significantly decreased Triglyceride (TG) (WMD: -16.48 mg/dl, 95% CI (-31.89, -1.08), P < 0.001) and total cholesterol (TC) (WMD: -13.00 mg/dl, 95% CI (-23.10, -2.91), P < 0.001) in patients with T2DM. However, vitamin C supplementation failed to improve LDL and HDL. The meta-regression analysis suggested that lipid profile improvement was affected by duration of vitamin C treatment. Dose-response analysis showed that vitamin C supplementation changed LDL significantly based on vitamin C dose. According to our findings, vitamin C supplementation significantly improved lipid profile via decreases in TG and TC. However, vitamin C failed to affect LDL and HDL in diabetic populations. It appears that vitamin C supplementation is more beneficial to lipid profile in long-term vs. short term interventions.",Namkhah Z; Ashtary-Larky D; Naeini F; Clark CCT; Asbaghi O,Pharmacological research,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33984490/,0,1,0,1,0,0
33982105,The Role of Nutrition in COVID-19 Susceptibility and Severity of Disease: A Systematic Review.,"Many nutrients have powerful immunomodulatory actions with the potential to alter susceptibility to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, progression to symptoms, likelihood of severe disease, and survival. The aim was to review the latest evidence on how malnutrition across all its forms (under- and overnutrition and micronutrient status) may influence both susceptibility to, and progression of, COVID-19. We synthesized information on 13 nutrition-related components and their potential interactions with COVID-19: overweight, obesity, and diabetes; protein-energy malnutrition; anemia; vitamins A, C, D, and E; PUFAs; iron; selenium; zinc; antioxidants; and nutritional support. For each section we provide: 1) a landscape review of pertinent material; 2) a systematic search of the literature in PubMed and EMBASE databases, including a wide range of preprint servers; and 3) a screen of 6 clinical trial registries. All original research was considered, without restriction to study design, and included if it covered: 1) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV) 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), or SARS-CoV viruses and 2) disease susceptibility or 3) disease progression, and 4) the nutritional component of interest. Searches took place between 16 May and 11 August 2020. Across the 13 searches, 2732 articles from PubMed and EMBASE, 4164 articles from the preprint servers, and 433 trials were returned. In the final narrative synthesis, we include 22 published articles, 38 preprint articles, and 79 trials. Currently there is limited evidence that high-dose supplements of micronutrients will either prevent severe disease or speed up recovery. However, results of clinical trials are eagerly awaited. Given the known impacts of all forms of malnutrition on the immune system, public health strategies to reduce micronutrient deficiencies and undernutrition remain of critical importance. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that prevention of obesity and type 2 diabetes will reduce the risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes.

33966337,Serum testosterone levels and testosterone supplementation in cirrhosis: A systematic review.,"Cirrhosis disrupts the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis causing low testosterone. Testosterone deficiency is associated with sarcopenia and osteopenia, leading to a state of frailty and worse clinical outcomes, morbidity and mortality. We aimed to conduct a systematic review on the relationship between serum testosterone and laboratory, anthropometric and clinical outcomes in observational and interventional studies in cirrhosis. PubMed and EMBASE were searched from inception through 27 August 2020 and reviewed independently by two investigators; a third reviewer solved disagreement. A qualitative summary of relevant findings was done. Methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale for non-interventional studies and the Cochrane Risk of Bias for interventional studies. Out of 3569 articles, 15 met inclusion criteria with six observational studies of 1267 patients and nine interventional studies of 580 patients. In observational studies, low serum testosterone level was associated with sarcopenia, shorter median time to hepatic decompensation, transplant requirement, higher model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores, and death in cirrhotic patients. Nine interventional studies (361 treated with testosterone vs 219 placebo, 1-36 months) showed that testosterone supplementation improved serum testosterone, appendicular mass and bone mineral density. However, no trial reported improvement in liver-related scores, complications, readmission rates or death.

33938330,Diabetes and zinc dyshomeostasis: Can zinc supplementation mitigate diabetic complications?,"Zinc present in the islet cells of the pancreas is crucial for the synthesis, storage, and secretion of insulin. The excretion of large amounts of zinc from the body is reported in diabetic situations. Zinc depletion and increased oxidative stress have a major impact on the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. It would be most relevant to ascertain if intervention with supplemental zinc compensating for its depletion would beneficially mitigate hyperglycemia and the attendant metabolic abnormalities, and secondary complications in diabetes. An exhaustive literature search on this issue indicates: (1) Concurrent hypozincemia and decreased tissue zinc stores in diabetes as a result of its increased urinary excretion and/or decreased intestinal absorption, (2) Several recent experimental studies have documented that supplemental zinc has a potential hypoglycemic effect in the diabetic situation, and also beneficially modulate the attendant metabolic abnormalities and compromised antioxidant status, and (3) Supplemental zinc also alleviates renal lesions, cataract and the risk of cardiovascular disease accompanying diabetes mellitus, and help restore gastrointestinal health in experimental diabetes. These studies have also attempted to identify the precise mechanisms responsible for zinc-mediated beneficial effects in diabetic situation. The evidence discussed in this review highlights that supplemental zinc may significantly contribute to its clinical application in the management of diabetic hyperglycemia and related metabolic abnormalities, and in the alleviation of secondary complications resulting from diabetic oxidative stress.",Barman S; Srinivasan K,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33938330/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33928687,The effect of vitamin D supplementation on fibroblast growth factor-23 in patients with chronic kidney disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"This is a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of oral vitamin D supplementation on serum fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) concentrations in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Manuscripts were extracted from PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science through February 2020. Subgroup analyses, sensitivity analysis, and meta-regression assessments were performed. A total of eight clinical trials with nine treatment arms were included in the final analysis. The pooled results showed no significant changes in circulating FGF23 following vitamin D supplementation compared to the control group (Standardized mean difference (SMD): 0.24; 95% confidence intervals (CIs): -0.03 to 0.50, p > 0.05). Subgroup analyses found that studies which had participants with a body mass index (BMI) higher than 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> , with an intervention duration shorter than 15 weeks, using phosphate binder medications, and trials that were on both patients with CKD undergoing hemodialysis and patients without hemodialysis treatment produced significant increases in FGF23 when concentration compared with the control group. This meta-analysis provides evidence that vitamin D supplementation does not have a significant effect on plasma FGF23 levels. However, further high-quality trials are required to identify the influence of oral vitamin D supplementation on FGF23 levels in patients with CKD.",Karimi E; Bitarafan S; Mousavi SM; Zargarzadeh N; Mokhtari P; Hawkins J; Meysamie A; Koohdani F,Phytotherapy research : PTR,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33928687/,0,1,0,1,0,0

This review addressed the current daily clinical practice of DR and the role of antioxidants in this practice. A systematic review of the studies on antioxidant supplementation in DR patients was presented. Fifteen studies accomplished the inclusion criteria. The analysis of these studies concluded that antioxidant supplementation has a IIB level of recommendation in adult Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus subjects without retinopathy or mild-to-moderate nonproliferative DR without diabetic macular oedema as a complementary therapy together with standard medical care.",Alfonso-Muñoz EA; Burggraaf-Sánchez de Las Matas R; Mataix Boronat J; Molina Martín JC; Desco C,International journal of molecular sciences,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33924714/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33923948,Sarcopenia and Vitamin D Deficiency in Patients with Crohn's Disease: Pathological Conditions That Should Be Linked Together.,"Sarcopenia is a prevalent condition in patients with Crohn's disease (CD), representing an independent predictor factor for the development of major postoperative complications. Thus, a proper assessment of the muscle strength, by using different validated tools, should be deemed an important step of the clinical management of these patients. Patients with CD are frequently malnourished, presenting a high prevalence of different macro- and micro-nutrient deficiencies, including that of vitamin D. The available published studies indicate that vitamin D is involved in the regulation of proliferation, differentiation, and regeneration of muscle cells. The relationship between vitamin D deficiency and sarcopenia has been extensively studied in other populations, with interesting evidence in regards to a potential role of vitamin D supplementation as a means to prevent and treat sarcopenia.

33919462,Omega-3-Rich Oils from Marine Side Streams and Their Potential Application in Food.,"Rapid population growth and increasing food demand have impacts on the environment due to the generation of residues, which could be managed using sustainable solutions such as the circular economy strategy (waste generated during food processing must be kept within the food chain). Reusing discarded fish remains is part of this management strategy, since they contain high-value ingredients and bioactive compounds that can be used for the development of nutraceuticals and functional foods. Fish side streams such as the head, liver, or skin or the cephalothorax, carapace, and tail from shellfish are important sources of oils rich in omega-3. In order to resolve the disadvantages associated with conventional methods, novel extraction techniques are being optimized to improve the quality and the oxidative stability of these high-value oils. Positive effects on cardiovascular and vision health, diabetes, cancer, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties, and immune system improvement are among their recognized properties. Their incorporation into different model systems could contribute to the development of functional foods, with market benefits for consumers. These products improve the nutritional needs of specific population groups in a scenario where noncommunicable diseases and pandemic crises are responsible for several deaths worldwide.",Pateiro M; Domínguez R; Varzakas T; Munekata PES; Movilla Fierro E; Lorenzo JM,Marine drugs,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33919462/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33918997,Iron Deficiency in Obesity and after Bariatric Surgery.,"Iron deficiency (ID) is particularly frequent in obese patients due to increased circulating levels of acute-phase reactant hepcidin and adiposity-associated inflammation. Inflammation in obese subjects is closely related to ID. It induces reduced iron absorption correlated to the inhibition of duodenal ferroportin expression, parallel to the increased concentrations of hepcidin. Obese subjects often get decreased inflammatory response after bariatric surgery, accompanied by decreased serum hepcidin and therefore improved iron absorption. Bariatric surgery can induce the mitigation or resolution of obesity-associated complications, such as hypertension, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia, adjusting many parameters in the metabolism. However, gastric bypass surgery and sleeve gastrectomy can induce malabsorption and may accentuate ID. The present review explores the burden and characteristics of ID and anemia in obese patients after bariatric surgery, accounting for gastric bypass technique (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass-RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). After bariatric surgery, obese subjects' iron status should be monitored, and they should be motivated to use adequate and recommended iron supplementation.",Bjørklund G; Peana M; Pivina L; Dosa A; Aaseth J; Semenova Y; Chirumbolo S; Medici S; Dadar M; Costea DO,Biomolecules,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33918997/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33917734,Rational Use of Protein Supplements in the Elderly-Relevance of Gastrointestinal Mechanisms.,"Protein supplements are increasingly used by older people to maintain nutrition and prevent or treat loss of muscle function. Daily protein requirements in older people are in the range of 1.2 gm/kg/day or higher. Many older adults do not consume this much protein and are likely to benefit from higher consumption. Protein supplements are probably best taken twice daily, if possible soon after exercise, in doses that achieve protein intakes of 30 gm or more per episode. It is probably not important to give these supplements between meals, as we have shown no suppressive effects of 30 gm whey drinks, and little if any suppression of 70 gm given to older subjects at varying time intervals from meals. Many gastrointestinal mechanisms controlling food intake change with age, but their contributions to changes in responses to protein are not yet well understood. There may be benefits in giving the supplement with rather than between meals, to achieve protein intakes above the effective anabolic threshold with lower supplement doses, and have favourable effects on food-induced blood glucose increases in older people with, or at risk of developing, type 2 diabetes mellitus; combined protein and glucose drinks lower blood glucose compared with glucose alone in older people.",Chapman I; Oberoi A; Giezenaar C; Soenen S,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33917734/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33895112,A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of exposure to environmental selenium and the risk of type 2 diabetes in nonexperimental studies.,"Accumulating evidence from both experimental and nonexperimental human studies in the last 15 years indicates that exposure to high levels of the trace element selenium increases the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, the relation of dose to effect is not well understood because randomized controlled trials used only one dose (200 μg/day) of selenium supplementation. While no new trial on this topic has been published since 2018, several nonexperimental studies have appeared. We therefore updated a previous meta-analysis to include recently published observational studies, and incorporated the recently developed one-stage random-effects model to display the dose-response relation between selenium and type 2 diabetes. We retrieved 34 potentially eligible nonexperimental studies on selenium and diabetes risk up to April 15, 2021. The bulk of the evidence indicates a direct relation between blood, dietary and urinary levels of selenium and risk of diabetes, but not with nail selenium, which may be considered a less reliable biomarker. The association was nonlinear, with risk increasing above 80 μg/day of dietary selenium. Whole blood/plasma/serum selenium concentrations of 160 μg/L corresponded to a risk ratio of 1.96 (95% CI 1.27-3.03) compared with a concentration of 90 μg/L (approximately 60 μg of daily selenium intake). The cohort studies, which are less susceptible to reverse causation bias, indicated increased risk for both blood and urine selenium levels and dietary selenium intake, whereas no such pattern emerged from studies relying on nail selenium content. Overall, the nonexperimental studies agree with findings from randomized controlled trials, indicating that moderate to high levels of selenium exposure are associated with increased risk for type 2 diabetes.",Vinceti M; Filippini T; Wise LA; Rothman KJ,Environmental research,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33895112/,0,1,0,1,0,0
33893683,The effect of grapes/grape products on glycemic response: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to examine the effect of grapes/grape products supplementation on glycemic indices in adults. Our systematic search to find relevant RCTs was performed up to February 2020 using PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. Based on the heterogeneity between included studies, a random effects or a fixed model was applied in the meta-analysis, and results were expressed as weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Twenty-nine clinical trials (1,297 participants) fulfilled the eligibility criteria of the present meta-analysis. Overall, the grapes/grape products supplementation significantly reduced homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (WMD: -0.54, 95% CI: -0.91, -0.17, p = . 004) but did not affect fasting insulin levels (WMD: -0.90 μIU/ml, 95% CI: -1.04, 2.84, p = .362) and hemoglobin A1C (Hb1Ac) percentage (WMD: 0.00%, 95% CI: -0.10, 0.11, p = . 916) in the main analyses. In addition, changes to fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels were in favor of the control group (WMD: 1.19 mg/dl, 95% CI: 0.05, 2.34, p = .041). We found that giving grapes/grape products to adults might have beneficial effects on the HOMA-IR.

33866314,"Diabetes, Age, and Duration of Supplementation Subgroup Analysis for the Effect of Coenzyme Q10 on Oxidative Stress: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) has been known as ubiquinone or ubidecarenone, which is a kind of lipid-soluble and vitamin-like antioxidant. It has a potent antioxidant effect against oxidation status via various mechanisms, including its ability to regenerate other antioxidants, such as vitamin E and vitamin C, and to increase antioxidant enzymes. Moreover, CoQ10 can quench free radicals and prevent lipid peroxidation. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of CoQ10 on oxidative stress variables. A comprehensive electronic database search in Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Medline was performed to identify eligible randomized clinical trials. A meta-analysis of included studies was performed on selected variables using a random-effects model. Quality assessment was conducted by means of the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. To evaluate the effect of CoQ10 supplementation, 17 trials and 972 participants were included for the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis of primary studies showed that CoQ10 increased serum total antioxidant capacity (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.62 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.18-1.05, I2 = 76.1%, p ˂ 0.001) and superoxide dismutase (SMD 0.40 U/mg, 95% CI 0.12-0.67, I2 = 9.6%, p ˂ 0.345) levels and decreased malondialdehyde (SMD -1.02 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.60 to -0.44, I2 = 88.2%, p ˂ 0.001) level significantly compared to the placebo group. Although the effect of CoQ10 on nitric oxide (SMD 1.01 µmol/L, 95% CI -1.53 to 3.54, p ˂ 0.001, I2 = 97.8%) and glutathione peroxidase (SMD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.86 to 0.84, p ˂ 0.001, I2 = 88.6%) was not significant, CoQ10 can be mentioned as an improvement in antioxidant defense status against reactive oxygen species. These supplements have positive effects on antioxidant defense against oxidizing agents and elevate antioxidant enzyme levels in the body.

33861447,The Effects of Nutraceuticals and Herbal Medicine on Candida albicans in Oral Candidiasis: A Comprehensive Review.,"Candida albicans is part of the healthy flora in the oral cavity. It can also cause opportunistic infection, which can be deleterious. The most typical type of chronic oral candidiasis is denture stomatitis, and C. albicans is identified as the most crucial organism in this situation. Due to the development of the resistant form of candida, using conventional drugs can sometimes be ineffective. Herbs and naturally imitative bioactive compounds could become a new source for antimycotic therapy. Several review studies suggest that herbal medicine and natural bioactive compounds have antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal effects. Thus, it is hypothesized that these natural products might have beneficial effects on pathogenic oral fungal flora such as C. albicans. Although the effects of herbs have been investigated as antifungal agents in several studies, to the best of our knowledge, the effects of these natural products on C. albicans have not yet been reviewed. Thus, the aim of this study was to review the anti-candida activity (especially C. albicans in oral candidiasis) of herbal medicines and natural bioactive compounds. It is concluded that, in general, medicinal plants and nutraceuticals such as garlic, green tea, propolis, curcumin, licorice root, cinnamon, resveratrol, ginger, and berberine are useful in the treatment of C. albicans in oral candidiasis and could be considered as a safe, accessible, and inexpensive management option in an attempt to prevent and treat oral diseases. However, most of the evidence is based on the in vitro and animal studies, so more clinical trials are needed.",Gharibpour F; Shirban F; Bagherniya M; Nosouhian M; Sathyapalan T; Sahebkar A,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33861447/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Literatures were retrieved from the public database and data from these trials were extracted. The quantitative efficacy of L-carnitine on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients were evaluated by maximal effect (E<sub>max</sub>) models with nonlinear mixed effects modeling (NONMEM). In the model of FPG, E<sub>max</sub> and <sub>treatment</sub> duration to reach half of the maximal effects (ET<sub>50</sub>) were -9.8% and 36.1 weeks, respectively. In the model of HbA1c, E<sub>max</sub> and ET<sub>50</sub> were -19.6% and 106 weeks, respectively. In addition, the durations for achieving 25%, 50%, 75%, 80%, and 90% E<sub>max</sub> of L-carnitine on FPG were 13, 36.1, 118, 160, and 390 weeks, respectively. The durations for achieving 25%, 50%, 75%, 80%, and 90% E<sub>max</sub> of L-carnitine on HbA1c were 38, 106, 334, 449, and 1058 weeks, respectively.

33813266,Effects of chromium supplementation on lipid profile in patients with type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of chromium supplementation on lipid profile in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A systematic search was performed in Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane library and PubMed databases to find randomized controlled trials (RCTs) related to the effect of chromium supplementation on lipid profile in patients with T2DM, up to June 2020. Meta-analyses were performed using the random-effects model, and I<sup>2</sup> index was used to evaluate heterogeneity. The primary search yielded 725 publications. 24 RCTs (with 28 effect size) were eligible. Our meta-analysis indicated that chromium supplementation resulted in a significant decrease in serum levels of triglyceride (TG) (MD: -6.54 mg/dl, 95 % CI: -13.08 to -0.00, P = 0.050) and total cholesterol (TC) (WMD: -7.77 mg/dl, 95 % CI: -11.35 to -4.18, P < 0.001). Furthermore, chromium significantly increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (WMD: 2.23 mg/dl, 95 % CI: 0.07-4.40, P = 0.043) level. However, chromium supplementation did not have significant effects on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (WMD: -8.54 mg/dl, 95 % CI: -19.58 to 2.49, P = 0.129) level. Chromium supplementation may significantly improve lipid profile in patients with T2DM by decreasing TG and TC and increasing HDL. However, based on our analysis, chromium failed to affect LDL. It should be noted that the lipid-lowering properties of chromium supplementation were small and may not reach clinical importance.",Asbaghi O; Naeini F; Ashtary-Larky D; Moradi S; Zakeri N; Eslampour E; Kelishadi MR; Naeini AA,Journal of trace elements in medicine and biology : organ of the Society for Minerals and Trace Elements (GMS),2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33813266/,0,1,0,1,0,0
33809311,Vitamin D and Cardiovascular Disease: An Updated Narrative Review.,"During the last two decades, the potential impact of vitamin D on the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been rigorously studied. Data regarding the effect of vitamin D on CVD risk are puzzling: observational data indicate an inverse nonlinear association between vitamin D status and CVD events, with the highest CVD risk at severe vitamin D deficiency; however, preclinical data and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) show several beneficial effects of vitamin D on the surrogate parameters of vascular and cardiac function. By contrast, Mendelian randomization studies and large RCTs in the general population and in patients with chronic kidney disease, a high-risk group for CVD events, largely report no significant beneficial effect of vitamin D treatment on CVD events. In patients with rickets and osteomalacia, cardiovascular complications are infrequently reported, except for an increased risk of heart failure. In conclusion, there is no strong evidence for beneficial vitamin D effects on CVD risk, either in the general population or in high-risk groups. Whether some subgroups such as individuals with severe vitamin D deficiency or a combination of low vitamin D status with specific gene variants and/or certain nutrition/lifestyle factors would benefit from vitamin D (metabolite) administration, remains to be studied.",Zittermann A; Trummer C; Theiler-Schwetz V; Lerchbaum E; März W; Pilz S,International journal of molecular sciences,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33809311/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33806754,Mushroom-Derived Medicine? Preclinical Studies Suggest Potential Benefits of Ergothioneine for Cardiometabolic Health.,"Medicinal use of mushrooms has been documented since ancient times, and in the modern world, mushrooms have a longstanding history of use in Eastern medicine. Recent interest in plant-based diets in Westernized countries has brought increasing attention to the use of mushrooms and mushroom-derived compounds in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases. Edible mushrooms are the most abundant food sources of the modified amino acid, ergothioneine. This compound has been shown to accumulate in almost all cells and tissues, but preferentially in those exposed to oxidative stress and injury. The demonstrated cytoprotectant effect of ergothioneine has led many to suggest a potential therapeutic role for this compound in chronic conditions that involve ongoing oxidative stress and inflammation, including cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. However, the in vivo effects of ergothioneine and its underlying therapeutic mechanisms in the whole organism are not as clear. Moreover, there are no well-defined, clinical prevention and intervention trials of ergothioneine in chronic disease. This review highlights the cellular and molecular mechanisms of action of ergothioneine and its potential as a Traditional, Complementary and Alternative Medicine for the promotion of cardiometabolic health and the management of the most common manifestations of cardiometabolic disease.",Lam-Sidun D; Peters KM; Borradaile NM,International journal of molecular sciences,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33806754/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33805912,Potential of Nutraceutical Supplementation in the Modulation of White and Brown Fat Tissues in Obesity-Associated Disorders: Role of Inflammatory Signalling.,"The high incidence of obesity is associated with an increasing risk of several chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Sustained obesity is characterized by a chronic and unsolved inflammation of adipose tissue, which leads to a greater expression of proinflammatory adipokines, excessive lipid storage and adipogenesis. The purpose of this review is to clarify how inflammatory mediators act during adipose tissue dysfunction in the development of insulin resistance and all obesity-associated diseases. In particular, we focused our attention on the role of inflammatory signaling in brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenic activity and the browning of white adipose tissue (WAT), which represent a relevant component of adipose alterations during obesity. Furthermore, we reported the most recent evidence in the literature on nutraceutical supplementation in the management of the adipose inflammatory state, and in particular on their potential effect on common inflammatory mediators and pathways, responsible for WAT and BAT dysfunction. Although further research is needed to demonstrate that targeting pro-inflammatory mediators improves adipose tissue dysfunction and activates thermogenesis in BAT and WAT browning during obesity, polyphenols supplementation could represent an innovative therapeutic strategy to prevent progression of obesity and obesity-related metabolic diseases.",Scarano F; Gliozzi M; Zito MC; Guarnieri L; Carresi C; Macrì R; Nucera S; Scicchitano M; Bosco F; Ruga S; Coppoletta AR; Mollace R; Maiuolo J; Bava I; Cardamone A; Ragusa M; Palma E; Musolino V; Mollace V,International journal of molecular sciences,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33805912/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Vitamin D deficiency has been implicated in various diseases, including metabolic syndrome (MetS), which is clinically defined by a set of metabolic and vascular disorders. The objective of this study was to review scientific evidence on the relationship between MetS and vitamin D deficiency to support the development of prevention strategies and health education programs. An inverse relationship has been reported between plasma vitamin D concentrations and the features that define MetS, i.e., elevated serum concentrations of glucose, total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins, triglycerides, glycosylated hemoglobin, and a high body mass index. Numerous studies have described the benefits of vitamin D supplementation to improve outcomes in individuals with MetS. Interventions to maintain optimal vitamin D concentrations are proposed as a preventive strategy against MetS.",Melguizo-Rodríguez L; Costela-Ruiz VJ; García-Recio E; De Luna-Bertos E; Ruiz C; Illescas-Montes R,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33802330/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33801269,Vegan Diet Health Benefits in Metabolic Syndrome.,"Plant-based diets (PBDs) are increasingly consumed by the Italian population and around the world. In particular, among PBDs, the vegan diet is a food pattern characterized by the exclusion of all animal-origin foods. What drives people to adopt this model are mainly ethical, health and environmental reasons. A vegan diet, if well-balanced and varied, can help in achieving and maintaining an optimal state of health. However, this nutritional approach, if not well-balanced, can cause deficiencies in proteins, ω-3 fatty acids, iron, vitamin D and calcium, zinc, iodine and, above all, vitamin B12. Oral food supplements especially fortified foods are recommended in these cases to restore the nutritional deficiencies. A vegan diet generally reduces the risk of developing chronic non-communicable degenerative diseases, such as metabolic syndrome (MetS) and, in addition, requires fewer natural resources for food production than an omnivorous diet. The aim of this review is to analyze the possible impact of the vegan diet on MetS onset and its treatment.",Marrone G; Guerriero C; Palazzetti D; Lido P; Marolla A; Di Daniele F; Noce A,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33801269/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33800650,Vitamin D Supplementation and Impact on Skeletal Muscle Function in Cell and Animal Models and an Aging Population: What Do We Know So Far?,"Aging is associated with impairment in skeletal muscle mass and contractile function, predisposing to fat mass gain, insulin resistance and diabetes. The impact of Vitamin D (VitD) supplementation on skeletal muscle mass and function in older adults is still controversial. The aim of this review was to summarize data from randomized clinical trials, animal dietary intervention and cell studies in order to clarify current knowledge on the effects of VitD on skeletal muscle as reported for these three types of experiments. A structured research of the literature in Medline via PubMed was conducted and a total of 43 articles were analysed (cells <i>n</i> = 18, animals <i>n</i> = 13 and humans <i>n</i> = 13). The results as described by these key studies demonstrate, overall, at cell and animal levels, that VitD treatments had positive effects on the development of muscle fibres in cells in culture, skeletal muscle force and hypertrophy. Vitamin D supplementation appears to regulate not only lipid and mitochondrial muscle metabolism but also to have a direct effect on glucose metabolism and insulin driven signalling. However, considering the human perspective, results revealed a predominance of null effects of the vitamin on muscle in the ageing population, but experimental design may have influenced the study outcome in humans. Well-designed long duration double-blinded trials, standardised VitD dosing regimen, larger sample sized studies and standardised measurements may be helpful tools to accurately determine results and compare to those observed in cells and animal dietary intervention models.",Romeu Montenegro K; Amarante Pufal M; Newsholme P,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33800650/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33798465,Vitamin D supplementation to prevent acute respiratory infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis of aggregate data from randomised controlled trials.,"A 2017 meta-analysis of data from 25 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) revealed a protective effect of this intervention. We aimed to examine the link between vitamin D supplementation and prevention of ARIs in an updated meta-analysis. For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry for studies listed from database inception to May 1, 2020. Double-blind RCTs of vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, vitamin D<sub>2</sub>, or 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) supplementation for any duration, with a placebo or low-dose vitamin D control, were eligible if they had been approved by a research ethics committee, and if ARI incidence was collected prospectively and prespecified as an efficacy outcome. Studies reporting results of long-term follow-up of primary RCTs were excluded. Aggregated study-level data, stratified by baseline 25(OH)D concentration and age, were obtained from study authors. Using the proportion of participants in each trial who had one or more ARIs, we did a random-effects meta-analysis to obtain pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs to estimate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of having one or more ARIs (primary outcome) compared with placebo. Subgroup analyses were done to estimate whether the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of ARI varied according to baseline 25(OH)D concentration (<25 nmol/L vs 25·0-49·9 nmol/L vs 50·0-74·9 nmol/L vs >75·0 nmol/L), vitamin D dose (daily equivalent of <400 international units [IU] vs 400-1000 IU vs 1001-2000 IU vs >2000 IU), dosing frequency (daily vs weekly vs once per month to once every 3 months), trial duration (≤12 months vs >12 months), age at enrolment (<1·00 years vs 1·00-15·99 years vs 16·00-64·99 years vs ≥65·00 years), and presence versus absence of airway disease (ie, asthma only, COPD only, or unrestricted). Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool. The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020190633. We identified 1528 articles, of which 46 RCTs (75 541 participants) were eligible. Data for the primary outcome were obtained for 48 488 (98·1%) of 49 419 participants (aged 0-95 years) in 43 studies. A significantly lower proportion of participants in the vitamin D supplementation group had one or more ARIs (14 332 [61·3%] of 23 364 participants) than in the placebo group (14 217 [62·3%] of 22 802 participants), with an OR of 0·92 (95% CI 0·86-0·99; 37 studies; I<sup>2</sup>=35·6%, p<sub>heterogeneity</sub>=0·018). No significant effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of having one or more ARIs was observed for any of the subgroups defined by baseline 25(OH)D concentration. However, protective effects of supplementation were observed in trials in which vitamin D was given in a daily dosing regimen (OR 0·78 [95% CI 0·65-0·94]; 19 studies; I<sup>2</sup>=53·5%, p<sub>heterogeneity</sub>=0·003), at daily dose equivalents of 400-1000 IU (0·70 [0·55-0·89]; ten studies; I<sup>2</sup>=31·2%, p<sub>heterogeneity</sub>=0·16), for a duration of 12 months or less (0·82 [0·72-0·93]; 29 studies; I<sup>2</sup>=38·1%, p<sub>heterogeneity</sub>=0·021), and to participants aged 1·00-15·99 years at enrolment (0·71 [0·57-0·90]; 15 studies; I<sup>2</sup>=46·0%, p<sub>heterogeneity</sub>=0·027). No significant interaction between allocation to the vitamin D supplementation group versus the placebo group and dose, dose frequency, study duration, or age was observed. In addition, no significant difference in the proportion of participants who had at least one serious adverse event in the vitamin supplementation group compared with the placebo group was observed (0·97 [0·86-1·07]; 36 studies; I<sup>2</sup>=0·0%, p<sub>heterogeneity</sub>=0·99). Risk of bias within individual studies was assessed as being low for all but three trials. Despite evidence of significant heterogeneity across trials, vitamin D supplementation was safe and overall reduced the risk of ARI compared with placebo, although the risk reduction was small. Protection was associated with administration of daily doses of 400-1000 IU for up to 12 months, and age at enrolment of 1·00-15·99 years. The relevance of these findings to COVID-19 is not known and requires further investigation.

33783683,Effect of Chromium Supplementation on Blood Glucose and Lipid Levels in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"In recent years, the prevalence and incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) have increased sharply worldwide. In order to evaluate the effect of chromium supplementation on patients with type 2 diabetes, a meta-analysis was conducted by searching the relevant literature. Randomized controlled trials on the effects of chromium supplements on glucose metabolism or lipid profile in patients with type 2 diabetes were retrieved from multiple databases. Literature screening, quality evaluation, and data extraction were conducted according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and Review Manager 5.4.0 was used for data analysis. A total of 10 randomized controlled trials involving 509 patients were included, including 269 cases in the experimental group and 240 cases in the placebo control group. Statistical analysis was conducted on the glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) to evaluate the blood glucose and lipid levels. Meta-analysis results showed that the differences between the experimental group and the control group in only one indicator of HbA1c were statistically significant, while there were no statistically significant differences in other indicators. The use of chromium supplements can reduce the glycosylated hemoglobin of type 2 diabetic patients to a certain extent, but it cannot effectively improve the fasting blood glucose and blood lipid levels of type 2 diabetic patients.",Zhao F; Pan D; Wang N; Xia H; Zhang H; Wang S; Sun G,Biological trace element research,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33783683/,0,1,0,1,0,0
33781847,2021 Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines for the Management of Dyslipidemia for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in Adults.,"The 2021 guidelines primary panel selected clinically relevant questions and produced updated recommendations, on the basis of important new findings that have emerged since the 2016 guidelines. In patients with clinical atherosclerosis, abdominal aortic aneurysm, most patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease, and those with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥ 5 mmol/L, statin therapy continues to be recommended. We have introduced the concept of lipid/lipoprotein treatment thresholds for intensifying lipid-lowering therapy with nonstatin agents, and have identified the secondary prevention patients who have been shown to derive the largest benefit from intensification of therapy with these agents. For all other patients, we emphasize risk assessment linked to lipid/lipoprotein evaluation to optimize clinical decision-making. Lipoprotein(a) measurement is now recommended once in a patient's lifetime, as part of initial lipid screening to assess cardiovascular risk. For any patient with triglycerides ˃ 1.5 mmol/L, either non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or apolipoprotein B are the preferred lipid parameter for screening, rather than low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. We provide updated recommendations regarding the role of coronary artery calcium scoring as a clinical decision tool to aid the decision to initiate statin therapy. There are new recommendations on the preventative care of women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Health behaviour modification, including regular exercise and a heart-healthy diet, remain the cornerstone of cardiovascular disease prevention. These guidelines are intended to provide a platform for meaningful conversation and shared-decision making between patient and care provider, so that individual decisions can be made for risk screening, assessment, and treatment.",Pearson GJ; Thanassoulis G; Anderson TJ; Barry AR; Couture P; Dayan N; Francis GA; Genest J; Grégoire J; Grover SA; Gupta M; Hegele RA; Lau D; Leiter LA; Leung AA; Lonn E; Mancini GBJ; Manjoo P; McPherson R; Ngui D; Piché ME; Poirier P; Sievenpiper J; Stone J; Ward R; Wray W,The Canadian journal of cardiology,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33781847/,0,0,0,0,0,0
33772908,The role of biofactors in the prevention and treatment of age-related diseases.,"The present demographic changes toward an aging society caused a rise in the number of senior citizens and the incidence and burden of age-related diseases (such as cardiovascular diseases [CVD], cancer, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD], diabetes mellitus, and dementia), of which nearly half is attributable to the population ≥60 years of age. Deficiencies in individual nutrients have been associated with increased risks for age-related diseases and high intakes and/or blood concentrations with risk reduction. Nutrition in general and the dietary intake of essential and nonessential biofactors is a major determinant of human health, the risk to develop age-related diseases, and ultimately of mortality in the older population. These biofactors can be a cost-effective strategy to prevent or, in some cases, even treat age-related diseases. Examples reviewed herein include omega-3 fatty acids and dietary fiber for the prevention of CVD, α-tocopherol (vitamin E) for the treatment of biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, vitamin D for the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases, thiamine and α-lipoic acid for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy, and the role of folate in cancer epigenetics. This list of potentially helpful biofactors in the prevention and treatment of age-related diseases, however, is not exhaustive and many more examples exist. Furthermore, since there is currently no generally accepted definition of the term biofactors, we here propose a definition that, when adopted by scientists, will enable a harmonization and consistent use of the term in the scientific literature.",Frank J; Kisters K; Stirban OA; Obeid R; Lorkowski S; Wallert M; Egert S; Podszun MC; Eckert GP; Pettersen JA; Venturelli S; Classen HG; Golombek J,"BioFactors (Oxford, England)",2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33772908/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33770443,Nutraceutical management of metabolic syndrome as a palliative and a therapeutic to coronavirus disease (COVID) crisis.,"The global market for medicinal plants and herbs is on the increase due to their desirability, efficacy, and less adverse effects as complementary and alternative medications to the orthodox pharmaceuticals, perhaps due to their natural components and qualities. Metabolic syndromes are managed with changes in diet, exercise, lifestyle modifications and the use of pharmacological agents. Plants are now known to have potent antioxidant and cholinergic activities which are relevant to the management of several metabolic syndromes, which are unfortunately, co-morbidity factors in the coronavirus disease crisis. This review will focus on the biological activities of some plant products used as complementary and alternative medicines in the management of metabolic syndromes, and on their reported antiviral, antithrombotic, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory properties, which are integral to their usage in the management of viral infections and may give an avenue for prophylactic and therapeutics especially in the absence of vaccines/formulated antiviral therapies.",Nna VU; McGrowder D; Nwokocha C,Archives of physiology and biochemistry,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33770443/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33745021,Dietary supplementation for gestational diabetes prevention and management: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"The use of supplement to prevent and ease gestational diabetes (GDM) progression has been examined in various studies, but the results were inconclusive, and studies evaluated dietary supplements separately. The present review aimed to evaluate the efficacy of various dietary supplementation on GDM risk and the surrogate markers for cardiometabolic risk of pregnant women with GDM. A comprehensive search on multiple databases were performed to identify randomized controlled trials. Random-effects model was used to pool the results in relative risk (RR) or mean difference. Fifty-three randomized controlled studies with 9443 pregnant women were included. Vitamin D (5 studies, RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.44, 0.94) and myo-inositol (4 studies, RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.20, 0.58) supplementation significantly reduced the risk of GDM. Myo-inositol, probiotics, and vitamin D showed significant intervention effect on surrogate markers related to glycemic control, lipid profile, inflammatory, and oxidative stress. However, the majority of included studies were clustered to Iran and Italy, which might convey a generalizability bias. Dietary supplementation including vitamin D and myoinositol supplementation has the potential in primary prevention and management of GDM, whereas probiotics demonstrated its ability in GDM management by improving the levels of surrogate markers for cardiometabolic risk. The potential for dietary supplement in preventing GDM or managing cardiometabolic risk of pregnant women should receive more attentions.",Chan KY; Wong MMH; Pang SSH; Lo KKH,Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33745021/,1,0,0,1,0,0
33741249,The Role of Dietary Fiber Supplementation in Regulating Uremic Toxins in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"The results of previously published meta-analyses showed that dietary fiber could reduce the levels of p-cresyl sulfate, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, these results were based on some trials with pre-post design and randomized controlled trials of low quality. Additionally, it has been suggested that the dosage and duration of fiber supplementation and patients' characteristics potentially influence the effect of dietary fiber in reducing uremic toxins, but it would appear that no research has provided reliable evidence. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. Data were pooled by the generic inverse variance method using random effects models and expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was quantified by I<sup>2</sup>. Publication bias was evaluated by Egger's test. Ten randomized controlled trials involving 292 patients with CKD were identified. Dietary fiber supplementation can significantly reduce the levels of indoxyl sulfate (SMD = -0.55, 95% CI = -1.04, -0.07, P = .03), p-cresyl sulfate (SMD = -0.47, 95% CI = -0.82, -0.13, P < .01), blood urea nitrogen (SMD = -0.31, 95% CI = -0.58, -0.03, P = .03), and uric acid (SMD = -0.60, 95% CI = -1.02, -0.18, P < .01), but not on reducing creatinine (SMD = -0.31, 95% CI = -0.73, 0.11, P = .14). In subgroup analyses, the reduction of indoxyl sulfate was more obvious among patients on dialysis than patients not on dialysis (P for interaction = .03); the reduction of creatinine was more obvious among patients without diabetes than those with diabetes (P for interaction <.01). This meta-analysis indicates that dietary fiber supplementation can significantly reduce the levels of uremic toxins in patients with CKD, with evidence for a more obvious effect of patients on dialysis and without diabetes. These findings inform recommendations for using dietary fiber to reducing the uremic toxin among CKD patients in clinical practice.",Yang HL; Feng P; Xu Y; Hou YY; Ojo O; Wang XH,Journal of renal nutrition : the official journal of the Council on Renal Nutrition of the National Kidney Foundation,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33741249/,0,0,0,1,0,0
33724587,Phytonutrient supplements and metabolic biomarkers of cardiovascular disease: An umbrella review of meta-analyses of clinical trials.,"Phytonutrients exert several pharmacological effects on humans. In this study, we performed an umbrella review of the association of phytonutrient supplements (PNSs) with biomarkers of cardiovascular disease. Relevant published systematic reviews and meta-analyses of clinical trials were identified by searching PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library until July 4, 2020. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for summarized effects and I<sup>2</sup> statistics of heterogeneity were extracted from individual studies or reanalyzed using a random-effects model. Of the 50 included studies, pooled effects of PNSs on blood pressure, lipid profiles, and glycemic control were reported in 16, 25, and 14 articles, respectively. The findings appeared to be highly heterogeneous among individual trials of included systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Ginger (WMD = -6.36 mmHg, 95% CI = -11.27, -1.46) and Hibiscus sabdariffa (WMD = -7.58 mmHg, 95% CI = -9.69, -5.46) were associated with lowered systolic blood pressure, whereas Aloe vera, Nigella sativa, and spirulina were associated with beneficial effects on both lipid profiles and glycemic control. In summary, this umbrella review has provided up-to-date evidence for the effect of PNSs on biomarkers related to hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. The results must be interpreted with caution due to potential heterogeneity.",Hoang T; Kim J,Phytotherapy research : PTR,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33724587/,0,1,0,0,0,0

Green coffee bean extract (GCBE) supplementation has been suggested to enhancing antioxidant capacity in people with obesity but results across studies are mixed. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of GCBE supplementation in overweight/obese with normal liver function and NAFLD adults with ALT, AST, γ-GTP, ALP, LDH, CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α as outcomes by searching PubMed and other databases. Eight studies were included, totaling 330 participants randomized to GCBE supplementation or placebo ranging from 50 mg/day to 1200 mg/day for 8-12 weeks. GCBE supplementation resulted in lower levels of TNF-α (mean difference = 1.37 pg/mL [95% CI = 0.97-1.76]; p < 0.00001). No significant difference was found in the remaining markers. In conclusion, GCBE supplementation attenuated TNF-α, a circulating inflammatory marker mediator which may be linked with lower systemic inflammation. However, potential cellular and molecular mechanisms by which GCBE exerts this positive effect warrants further investigations in human model studies.",Asbaghi O; Kashkooli S; Mardani M; Rezaei Kelishadi M; Fry H; Kazemi M; Kaviani M,Complementary therapies in clinical practice,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33714861/,1,0,0,1,0,0

33676391,Antidiabetic Potential of Naturally Occurring Sesquiterpenes: A Review.,"Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is an endocrine disease, which is the 3rd leading cause of death in humans; additionally, it is one of the major key concerns over the globe. The high levels of glucose in the blood stream are as well characterized by hyperglycaemia leading to serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, kidney, eyes, and nerves. The best treatment of DM is still not available; many scientists worldwide are trying hard to seek out suitable treatment of DM. Though numerous synthetic drugs are developed for the treatment of diabetes but their utility has been hampered because of several side effects and poor efficacy. Among various approaches for the treatment of DM, herbal medicine, enriched extracts, and naturally derived molecules are most effective. Plant based herbal medicines contain many bioactive phytochemicals, such as terpenoids, alkaloids, flavonoids & phenolics, etc. which are used in the treatment of many diseases. The plant-derived molecules and their suitable structure modification have given many leads or drugs to the world like sesquiterpene; artemisinin and their derivatives artemether & artesunate as an antimalarial drugs. Sesquiterpenes are available in the human diet and are largely taken as components of the many folk medicines and dietary supplements. Sesquiterpenes have a wide range of biological activities, such as anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-nociceptive, immunomodulatory, antidiabetic and antimicrobial, which make them potential targets for the development of new therapeutics and their usage for medical purposes. Natural products have gained the attention of the world due to their large number of biological activities, high safety and fewer side effect. The review mainly focuses on bioactive sesquiterpenes such as β-caryophyllene, dysidine, farnesol & eremanthin, etc., a class of terpenoids that may play an important role in the treatment or prevention of this gruesome disorder like diabetes, with their underlying mechanisms for the blood-glucose-lowering property.",Maurya A; Mohan S; Verma SC,Current topics in medicinal chemistry,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33676391/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33674204,Vitamin D supplements: The pharmacists' perspective.,"The purpose of this narrative review was to provide guidance for pharmacists concerning vitamin D supplementation. Relevant studies were identified in a search of MEDLINE/PubMed, EBSCOhost, and Google Scholar from January 1966 to September 2020 using the search terms vitamin D, vitamin D<sub>2</sub>, vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, calcitriol, and vitamin D deficiency. Abstracts were reviewed for relevance and, if relevant, full-text articles were retrieved and reviewed. References were checked, and citation searches using identified studies were conducted. The literature search included English-language studies involving administration of vitamin D monotherapy compared with placebo. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of less than 12 ng/mL indicate a vitamin D deficiency. The Institute of Medicine recommends a daily intake of 600 IU of vitamin D in individuals aged up to 70 years and 800 IU in those aged above 70 years. Vitamin D is labeled for rickets, osetomalacia, hypophosphatemia (familial or secondary), renal osteodystrophy, and corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis. When used for these indications, vitamin D should be prescribed with appropriate monitoring by a qualified health care practitioner. There is evidence for vitamin D supplementation in individuals aged 75 years or older and in those with problems associated with mobility, gait, or balance. There is insufficient evidence to support vitamin D supplementation in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, cancer, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations, new-onset type 2 diabetes, infectious lung diseases, cognitive dysfunction, Alzheimer disease, and depression, or in prenatal use.

33619867,Association between neuropathy and B-vitamins: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is common in patients with diseases that are in turn associated with deficiency of the B-vitamins, and vitamin treatment has shown mixed results. This systematic review and meta-analysis studied the association between PN/pain and B-vitamin biomarkers and investigated whether vitamin treatment can ameliorate the symptoms. PubMed and Web of Science were searched according to the study protocol. A total of 46 observational and seven interventional studies were identified and included in the data synthesis. The presence of PN was associated with lowered B12 levels (pooled estimate [95% CIs] = 1.51 [1.23-1.84], n = 34, Cochran Q Test I<sup>2</sup>  = 43.3%, p = 0.003) and elevated methylmalonic acid (2.53 [1.39-4.60], n = 9, I<sup>2</sup>  = 63.8%, p = 0.005) and homocysteine (3.48 [2.01-6.04], n = 15, I<sup>2</sup>  = 70.6%, p < 0.001). B12 treatment (vs. the comparators) showed a non-significant association with symptom improvement (1.36 (0.66-2.79), n = 4, I<sup>2</sup>  = 28.9%). Treatment with B1 was associated with a significant improvement in symptoms (5.34 [1.87-15.19], n = 3, I<sup>2</sup>  = 64.6%, p = 0.059). Analysis of seven trials combined showed a non-significant higher odds ratio for improvement under treatment with the B-vitamins (2.58 [0.98-6.79], I<sup>2</sup>  = 80.0%, p < 0.001). PN is associated with lowered plasma vitamin B12 and elevated methylmalonic acid and homocysteine. Overall, interventional studies have suggested that B-vitamins could improve symptoms of PN. Available trials have limitations and generally did not investigate vitamin status prior to treatment. Well-designed studies, especially in non-diabetes PN, are needed.

33607289,Associations of Omega-3 fatty acids with brain morphology and volume in cognitively healthy older adults: A narrative review.,"Human neurodevelopment is complete by the 4th decade of life at which point brain atrophy ensues with variable rate and regionality into old age. Literally all regions of the brain experience atrophy with older age, however the pattern and rate of atrophy can dictate the behavioral consequences (i.e., cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease). Substantial research has aimed to discover the reasons why some people experience greater morphologic changes that produce undesirable consequences with aging and how it may be prevented. One possible explanation is diet, particularly fish consumption and the intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega 3) concentrated in fish oil. This narrative review examines the available evidence on the association between omega-3 and brain volume in non-demented older adults. A PubMed search of the literature was conducted in search of studies that investigated the associations of omega-3 on brain morphology and volume in cognitively intact older adults. Inclusion criteria were: populations of adults aged 45 years or over, who were cognitively intact, free of any central nervous system disease, and free of advanced structural brain atrophy. Study participants had to have DHA and EPA levels measured either by blood testing or scoring of dietary intake. There were no restrictions to dates of publication. Studies including demented participants, or participants with substantial white or grey matter atrophy visible on magnetic resonance imaging were excluded. The search identified only 12 studies, 8 of which were cross-sectional observational studies, 3 longitudinal observational studies, and 1 randomized controlled trial published between 2007 and 2019. The largest amount of evidence indicated that the hippocampus was most frequently involved in this association, with a higher volume associated with higher omega-3 levels. Larger total grey matter, total brain volume, and lower white matter lesion volume were also associated with higher omega-3 among four of the reviewed studies. However, most studies reviewed provided mixed findings regarding the presence or absence of the association of interest, and the findings were observed to be brain region-dependent. Current evidence is still insufficient to formulate recommendations for omega-3 intake to support brain health specifically.",Macaron T; Giudici KV; Bowman GL; Sinclair A; Stephan E; Vellas B; de Souto Barreto P,Ageing research reviews,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33607289/,1,0,0,0,0,1

After article screening, a total of 19 articles were included in this meta-analysis. The meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 and STATA 14.0 software. The overall pooled estimate of standardized mean difference (SMD) of mangiferin's effect on blood glucose was -1.27 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.71, -0.82, P < .00001). Body weight increased in lean diabetic animals with an SMD of 1.41 (95% CI: 0.57, 2.25; P = .001), while it decreased in obese diabetic animals with an SMD of -0.92 (95% CI: -1.69, -0.14; P = .02). Mangiferin intake reduced serum total cholesterol and triglycerides levels with SMDs of -1.02 (95% CI: -1.43, -0.61; P < .001) and -1.24 (95% CI: -1.70, -0.79; P < .001), respectively. The meta-analysis suggests that oral intake of mangiferin has a significant antidiabetic effect in animal models, and the systematic review suggested that this function might be attributed to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties, as well as to its function of improving glycolipid metabolism and enhancing insulin signaling.",Wu Y; Liu W; Yang T; Li M; Qin L; Wu L; Liu T,"Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)",2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33601215/,0,1,0,1,0,0
33586928,Intake of branched chain amino acids favors post-exercise muscle recovery and may improve muscle function: optimal dosage regimens and consumption conditions.,"Numerous sportspeople consume nutritional ergogenic aids, including branched chain amino acids (BCAA), considered to favor post-exercise muscle recovery. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of BCAA on recovery from muscle damage produced by high-intensity exercise and muscle function. This allowed to define the optimal dosage regimen and consumption conditions taking into account the combination of BCAA with other products. A systematic review of the scientific literature published over the past 15 years using the PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science databases was carried out. Nineteen articles were selected. The most optimal regimen for post-exercise muscle recovery and/or muscle function after high-intensity resistance exercise was 2-10 g BCAA/day (leucine: isoleucine: valine at 2:1:1), consumed as a supplement alone or combined with arginine and carbohydrates, 3 previous days before exercise, immediately before and after exercise, regardless of training level. This treatment can improve perceived muscle damage, fatigue, circumference of arm/leg, counter movement jump, maximum muscle strength and maximum voluntary contraction, and reduce creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels, mainly in young males. Intake of BCAA favors post-exercise muscle recovery and may improve muscle function. The present review can serve as a guidance for high intensity endurance athletes who need to reduce post-exercise muscle damage and maintain or improve muscle function, especially in training periods and competition events planned with short rest periods.",Arroyo-Cerezo A; Cerrillo I; Ortega Á; Fernández-Pachón MS,The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitness,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33586928/,0,1,0,0,0,0
33572884,Creatine in Health and Disease.,"Although creatine has been mostly studied as an ergogenic aid for exercise, training, and sport, several health and potential therapeutic benefits have been reported. This is because creatine plays a critical role in cellular metabolism, particularly during metabolically stressed states, and limitations in the ability to transport and/or store creatine can impair metabolism. Moreover, increasing availability of creatine in tissue may enhance cellular metabolism and thereby lessen the severity of injury and/or disease conditions, particularly when oxygen availability is compromised. This systematic review assesses the peer-reviewed scientific and medical evidence related to creatine's role in promoting general health as we age and how creatine supplementation has been used as a nutritional strategy to help individuals recover from injury and/or manage chronic disease. Additionally, it provides reasonable conclusions about the role of creatine on health and disease based on current scientific evidence. Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that creatine supplementation has several health and therapeutic benefits throughout the lifespan.",Kreider RB; Stout JR,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33572884/,0,1,0,0,0,0
33572228,Potential of Creatine in Glucose Management and Diabetes.,"Creatine is one of the most popular supplements worldwide, and it is frequently used by both athletic and non-athletic populations to improve power, strength, muscle mass and performance. A growing body of evidence has been identified potential therapeutic effects of creatine in a wide variety of clinical conditions, such as cancer, muscle dystrophy and neurodegenerative disorders. Evidence has suggested that creatine supplementation alone, and mainly in combination with exercise training, may improve glucose metabolism in health individuals and insulin-resistant individuals, such as in those with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Creatine itself may stimulate insulin secretion in vitro, improve muscle glycogen stores and ameliorate hyperglycemia in animals. In addition, exercise induces numerous metabolic benefits, including increases in insulin-independent muscle glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity. It has been speculated that creatine supplementation combined with exercise training could result in additional improvements in glucose metabolism when compared with each intervention separately. The possible mechanism underlying the effects of combined exercise and creatine supplementation is an enhanced glucose transport into muscle cell by type 4 glucose transporter (GLUT-4) translocation to sarcolemma. Although preliminary findings from small-scale trials involving patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are promising, the efficacy of creatine for improving glycemic control is yet to be confirmed. In this review, we aim to explore the possible therapeutic role of creatine supplementation on glucose management and as a potential anti-diabetic intervention, summarizing the current knowledge and highlighting the research gaps.",Solis MY; Artioli GG; Gualano B,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33572228/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33569370,Inflammatory Activities in Type 2 Diabetes Patients With Co-morbid Angiopathies and Exploring Beneficial Interventions: A Systematic Review.,"<b>Background:</b> Diabetes is a long-term condition that can be treated and controlled but do not yet have a cure; it could be induced by inflammation and the goal of managing it is to prevent additional co-morbidities and reduce glycemic fluctuations. There is a need to examine inflammatory activities in diabetes-related angiopathies and explore interventions that could reduce the risk for future outcome or ameliorate its effects to provide insights for improved care and management strategies. <b>Method:</b> The study was conducted in Embase (1946-2020), Ovid Medline (1950-2020), and PubMed databases (1960-2020) using the PICO framework. Primary studies (randomized controlled trials) on type 2 diabetes mellitus and inflammatory activities in diabetes-related angiopathies were included. Terms for the review were retrieved from the Cochrane library and from PROSPERO using its MeSH thesaurus qualifiers. Nine articles out of 454 total hits met the eligibility criteria. The quality assessment for the selected study was done using the Center for Evidence-Based Medicine Critical Appraisal Sheet. <b>Results:</b> Data analysis showed that elevated CRP, TNF-α, and IL-6 were the most commonly found inflammatory indicator in diabetes-related angiopathies, while increased IL-10 and soluble RAGE was an indicator for better outcome. Use of drugs such as salsalate, pioglitazone, simvastatin, and fenofibrate but not glimepiride or benfotiamine reported a significant decrease in inflammatory events. Regular exercise and consumption of dietary supplements such as ginger, hesperidin which have anti-inflammatory properties, and those containing prebiotic fibers (e.g., raspberries) revealed a consistent significant (<i>p</i> < 0.05) reduction in inflammatory activities. <b>Conclusion:</b> Inflammatory activities are implicated in diabetes-related angiopathies; regular exercise, the intake of healthy dietary supplements, and medications with anti-inflammatory properties could result in improved protective risk outcome for diabetes patients by suppressing inflammatory activities and elevating anti-inflammatory events.",Nwadiugwu MC,Frontiers in public health,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33569370/,0,1,0,0,0,0
33567628,Nutraceuticals against Oxidative Stress in Autoimmune Disorders.,"Antioxidant mechanisms are constituted of enzymes, endogenous, and non-enzymatic, exogenous, which have the role of counterbalancing oxidative stress. Intake of these compounds occurs in the diet. Vegetables, plants, and fruits contain a wide range of alkaloids, polyphenols, and terpenoids which are called ""phytochemicals"". Most of these substances are responsible for the positive properties of fruits and vegetables, which are an essential part of a healthy life with roles in ameliorating chronic illnesses and favoring longevity. Nutraceuticals are substances contained in a food or fragment of it influencing health with positive effects on health helping in precenting or treating disorders. We conducted a review illustrating the principal applications of nutraceuticals in autoimmune disorders. Literature reported several studies about exogenous dietary antioxidant supplementation in diverse autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, diabetes, and multiple sclerosis. In these pathologies, promising results were obtained in some cases. Positive outcomes were generally associated with a reduction of oxidative stress parameters and a boost to antioxidant systems, and sometimes with anti-inflammatory effects. The administration of exogenous substances through food derivates or dietary supplements following scientific standardization was demonstrated to be effective. Further bias-free and extended studies should be conducted that include ever-increasing oxidative stress biomarkers.",Mannucci C; Casciaro M; Sorbara EE; Calapai F; Di Salvo E; Pioggia G; Navarra M; Calapai G; Gangemi S,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33567628/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33546262,Does the High Prevalence of Vitamin D Deficiency in African Americans Contribute to Health Disparities?,"African Americans have higher incidence of, and mortality from, many health-related problems than European Americans. They also have a 15 to 20-fold higher prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency. Here we summarize evidence that: (i) this health disparity is partly due to insufficient vitamin D production, caused by melanin in the skin blocking the UVB solar radiation necessary for its synthesis; (ii) the vitamin D insufficiency is exacerbated at high latitudes because of the combination of dark skin color with lower UVB radiation levels; and (iii) the health of individuals with dark skin can be markedly improved by correcting deficiency and achieving an optimal vitamin D status, as could be obtained by supplementation and/or fortification. Moderate-to-strong evidence exists that high 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and/or vitamin D supplementation reduces risk for many adverse health outcomes including all-cause mortality rate, adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, cancer, diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease and dementia, multiple sclerosis, acute respiratory tract infections, COVID-19, asthma exacerbations, rickets, and osteomalacia. We suggest that people with low vitamin D status, which would include most people with dark skin living at high latitudes, along with their health care provider, consider taking vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplements to raise serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) or possibly higher.",Ames BN; Grant WB; Willett WC,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33546262/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33544528,COVID-19 and nutritional deficiency: a review of existing knowledge.,"COVID-19 has resulted in an ongoing global pandemic, which spread largely among people who have had close contact with the infected person. The immunopathology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus includes the production of an excess amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines ""a cytokine-storm"". The respiratory system (main), cardiovascular system and the gastrointestinal tract are the most affected body systems during viral infection. It has been found that most of the patients who require admission to hospital are elderly or have chronic underlying diseases. Higher cases of malnutrition and co-morbidities like diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases are reported in elderly patients due to which, the immune system weakens and hence, the response to the virus is diminished in magnitude. A deficiency of micronutrients results in impaired immune responses leading to improper secretion of cytokines, alterations in secretory antibody response and antibody affinity which increases susceptibility to viral infection. The deficiency of various micronutrients in COVID-19 patient can be treated by appropriate nutritional supplements, prescribed after evaluating the patients' nutritional status. Here we aim to highlight the role of a few particular nutrients namely Vitamin D, Vitamin C, Omega-3 fatty acids, Zinc and Magnesium along with the synergistic roles they play in enhancing immunity and thus, maintaining homeostasis.",Muthuvattur Pallath M; Ahirwar AK; Chandra Tripathi S; Asia P; Sakarde A; Gopal N,Hormone molecular biology and clinical investigation,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33544528/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33534730,Effects of Vitamin D Supplementation on Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes in Patients With Prediabetes: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"While observational studies have shown an association between vitamin D insufficiency and diabetes, it is unclear whether intervention with vitamin D supplements can lower the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). To assess whether vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of T2DM in people with prediabetes. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from inception to 5 July 2019. We included randomized controlled trials assessing vitamin D supplementation versus placebo in relation to new-onset T2DM in people with prediabetes. We screened studies and extracted data from published trials independently. We identified eight eligible trials with a total of 4,896 subjects. Vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced the risk of T2DM (risk ratio [RR] 0.89 [95% CI 0.80-0.99]; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0%). Benefit was found in nonobese subjects (RR 0.73 [95% CI 0.57-0.92]) but not in obese subjects (RR 0.95 [95% CI 0.84-1.08]) (<i>P</i> <sub>interaction</sub> = 0.048). The reversion of prediabetes to normoglycemia occurred in 116 of 548 (21.2%) participants in the vitamin D group and 75 of 532 (14.1%) in the control group. Vitamin D supplementation increased reversion rate of prediabetes to normoglycemia (RR 1.48 [95% CI 1.14-1.92]; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0%.) LIMITATIONS: Definitions of prediabetes and new-onset diabetes in eligible studies were different, and long-term data on outcomes of T2DM prevention were lacking. In persons with prediabetes, vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of T2DM and increases the reversion rate of prediabetes to normoglycemia. The benefit of the prevention of T2DM could be limited to nonobese subjects. Individual participant data meta-analyses are needed to confirm these findings.",Zhang Y; Tan H; Tang J; Li J; Chong W; Hai Y; Feng Y; Lunsford LD; Xu P; Jia D; Fang F,Diabetes care,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33534730/,0,1,0,1,0,0
33534727,The Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation on Insulin Sensitivity: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Vitamin D has been suggested to affect peripheral insulin sensitivity. Evidence regarding the effect of vitamin D supplementation on insulin sensitivity is still conflicting. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation on insulin sensitivity in humans with or at risk for insulin resistance. PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from 1980 until 31 December 2018 reporting treatment effects of vitamin D supplementation on insulin sensitivity. The main outcome of interest was the change in insulin sensitivity, derived from the gold standard hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp or the Matsuda index derived from the oral glucose tolerance test and insulin sensitivity index from intravenous glucose tolerance test. We extracted data on the standardized mean difference between the vitamin D treatment and placebo groups in change from baseline insulin sensitivity. Eighteen RCTs were included in this meta-analysis comparing vitamin D supplementation (<i>n</i> = 612) with placebo (<i>n</i> = 608). Vitamin D supplementation had no effect on insulin sensitivity (standardized mean difference -0.01, 95% CI -0.12, 0.10; <i>P</i> = 0.87, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0%). Visual inspection of funnel plot symmetry did not suggest potential publication bias. The number of individuals who participated in the included studies was relatively small, possibly due to the invasive character of the measurement (e.g., clamp). This meta-analysis provides no evidence that vitamin D supplementation has a beneficial effect on peripheral insulin sensitivity in people with or at risk for insulin resistance.",Pramono A; Jocken JWE; Blaak EE; van Baak MA,Diabetes care,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33534727/,0,1,0,1,0,0
33525745,Okra (<i>Abelmoschus Esculentus</i>) as a Potential Dietary Medicine with Nutraceutical Importance for Sustainable Health Applications.,"Recently, there has been a paradigm shift from conventional therapies to relatively safer phytotherapies. This divergence is crucial for the management of various chronic diseases. Okra (<i>Abelmoschus esculentus</i> L.) is a popular vegetable crop with good nutritional significance, along with certain therapeutic values, which makes it a potential candidate in the use of a variety of nutraceuticals. Different parts of the okra fruit (mucilage, seed, and pods) contain certain important bioactive components, which confer its medicinal properties. The phytochemicals of okra have been studied for their potential therapeutic activities on various chronic diseases, such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular, and digestive diseases, as well as the antifatigue effect, liver detoxification, antibacterial, and chemo-preventive activities. Moreover, okra mucilage has been widely used in medicinal applications such as a plasma replacement or blood volume expanders. Overall, okra is considered to be an easily available, low-cost vegetable crop with various nutritional values and potential health benefits. Despite several reports about its therapeutic benefits and potential nutraceutical significance, there is a dearth of research on the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of okra, which has hampered its widespread use in the nutraceutical industry. This review summarizes the available literature on the bioactive composition of okra and its potential nutraceutical significance. It will also provide a platform for further research on the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of okra for its possible commercial production as a therapeutic agent against various chronic diseases.",Elkhalifa AEO; Alshammari E; Adnan M; Alcantara JC; Awadelkareem AM; Eltoum NE; Mehmood K; Panda BP; Ashraf SA,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33525745/,1,0,0,0,0,0

33503443,Dietary vitamin D equilibrium in serum ameliorates direct bilirubin associated diabetes mellitus.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM), a non-communicable endocrine disease that is marked by a differing degree of tolerance to insulin and dysfunction. The connection between diabetes and liver failure important to doctors in general practice diabetologists and hepatologists. DM is linked with an elevated risk of hepatic consequences and mortality of liver cirrhosis patients. DM may facilitate to insult the liver by inducing inflammation and fibrosis by elevating mitochondrial oxidative stress. The conventional liver function indices are bilirubin including Indirect Bilirubin (IBil), Direct Bilirubin (DBil), and Total Bilirubin (TBil). DBil, IBil, and TBil, have diverse clinical implications as the standard index of liver disorder. An elevated level of DBil may suggest damage to the hepatic cell whereas TBil is within the normal range. Thus, increased liver enzymes are correlated with hepatic insulin resistance in healthy subjects. Notably, a significant correlation between DBil levels and Insulin resistance risk could indicate a connection between liver dysfunction and diabetes mellitus risk. Thus, our primary goal via the current review to examine the impact of dietary vitamin D (VitD) in serum mediated risk reduction of insulin resistance and further incidence of DM through inflammatory liver associated high DBil. Therefore, modifying these inflammatory pathways may be a therapeutic alternative approach for diabetes treatment.",Sharma K; Zajc I; Žiberna L,Chemico-biological interactions,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33503443/,1,0,0,0,0,0

33497756,Ketogenic diet for depression: A potential dietary regimen to maintain euthymia?,"Approximately 30% of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) present resistance to current pharmacological therapies. There is the possibility that an appropriate nutritional regimen can maintain euthymia. Poor dietary pattern and lack of nutritional knowledge are common among today's population; nutrient-rich foods are being replaced by highly processed foods that lead to a higher risk of developing chronic diseases such as metabolic syndrome, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes. There is growing evidence of the beneficial role of vitamins and dietary supplements for improving symptoms in a range of affective disorders by regulating the gut microbiome, gut-brain axis, and neurotransmitter levels. Reduced GABA neurotransmission is regularly observed in MDD. Moreover, positive allosteric GABA modulators (i.e benzodiazepines) are widely prescribed to alleviate depression symptoms, but their use needs to be limited, as it can lead to addiction. An alternative option may be the adherence to a ketogenic diet, which consists of low-carbohydrate, moderate-protein, and high-fat intake. It is mainly known for its beneficial role in weight-loss, refractory epilepsy treatment, and balancing glucose levels. A ketogenic diet can also increase GABA levels to aid the mechanism of action of monoaminergic drugs. Thus, it could potentially be used in the treatment for affective disorders due to its potential role in GABA/glutamate balance. While more research is needed before this regimen can be regularly recommended to patients, here we discuss evidence that may encourage physicians to prescribe ketogenic diet as an adjuvant for patients receiving psychotherapy and pharmacology.",Włodarczyk A; Cubała WJ; Stawicki M,Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33497756/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33487311,The role of vitamin D in prevention of type 2 diabetes. A meta-analysis.,"Recently, there are evidences that have shown vitamin D homeostasis has an impact in the development of type 2 diabetes. However, still it is unclear if vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of overt diabetes. This meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies and RCTs was conducted to evaluate the role of vitamin D in prevention of type 2 diabetes and to elucidate this controversial topic. A systematic search for English-language literature was done via PUBMED/Medline and Google Scholar up to March 2020. Based on a fixed and random effects model, the OR, HR and 95% CI were used to evaluate the combined risk. This study followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) Guidelines. After eligibility assessment 10 studies with a total of 34,882 participants were included in meta-analysis. Meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies suggested that there was a statistically significant association between the vitamin D and type 2 Diabetes; the pooled OR (95%CI) was 1.77 [1.51, 2.07] (P < 0.001). Meta-analysis of RCTs have shown that there was no statistically significant association between vitamin D supplementation and prevention of type 2 Diabetes, the pooled HR (95%CI) was 0.89 [0.77, 1.02] (P = 0.08). In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that there is association between the vitamin D and type 2 diabetes.

33484037,Effects of garlic supplementation on oxidative stress and antioxidative capacity biomarkers: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Evidence suggests that garlic supplementation may have an effect on oxidative stress by augmenting the rate of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants and diminishing pro-oxidant enzymes. Given inconsistencies across studies, we aimed to systematically review the current literature and quantify the effects of garlic supplementation on oxidative stress. We conducted a systematic search with multiple databases (Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science) to find relevant articles published prior to October 2020. Results were reported as bias-corrected standardized mean difference (Hedges' g) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random-effects models. Cochrane's Q and I squared (I<sup>2</sup> ) tests were used to determine heterogeneity among the studies included. Twelve randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Garlic doses ranged from 80 to 4,000 mg/day, and intervention duration varied between 2 and 24 weeks. Garlic supplementation increased serum level of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (Hedges' g: 2.77, 95% CI: 1.37 to 4.17, p < 0.001) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (Hedges' g: 13.76, 95% CI: 4.24 to 23.29, p = 0.004), while it reduced the malondialdehyde serum level (MDA) (Hedges' g: -1.94, 95% CI: -3.17 to -0.70, p = 0.002). Due to limited data available, glutathione (GSH) was not considered for the current meta-analysis. The nonlinear dose-response effect of garlic supplementation was not observed with regard to serum TAC and MDA levels (TAC: p-nonlinearity = 0.398; MDA: p-nonlinearity = 0.488). Garlic supplementation appears to improve serum levels of TAC, MDA, and SOD. Garlic supplementation may be useful to reduce oxidative stress and related diseases.

All trials that investigated the effect of probiotics on serum glycemic markers (Fasting Plasma Glucose [FPG], Hemoglobin A1C, Insulin, Homeostatic Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance [HOMA-IR], and Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index [QUICKI]), and renal status markers (Creatinine [Cr], Blood Urea Nitrogen [BUN], and Glomerular Filtration Rate [GFR]) were included. Seven trials that included 340 patients were identified for analysis. The results indicated that probiotics significantly reduced FPG (WMD= -19.08 mg/dl; 95% CI= -32.16, -5.99; P=0.004), HOMA-IR (WMD= -1.88; 95% CI= -3.63, -0.12; P=0.036), and Cr (WMD= -0.18 mg/dl; 95% CI= -0.26, -0.09; P<0.001) levels in DN patients; however, there was no statistically significant change in Hemoglobin A1C, Insulin, QUICKI, BUN, and GFR.

However, its effectiveness and evidence quality require further evaluation. To investigate the efficacy of oral vitamin C supplementation in improving glycemic control, cardiovascular risk factors, and oxidative stress in people with type 2 diabetes. Databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library) and clinical trial registries were searched for randomized controlled trials up to 8 September 2020. Trials in adults with type 2 diabetes were included. Trials were excluded if supplements were not exclusive to vitamin C and if <2 weeks in duration. Primary outcomes were HbA<sub>1c</sub>, glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure (BP). Data were extracted for changes in outcomes between vitamin C and control groups. Evidence certainty was assessed using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methods. Twenty-eight studies (<i>N</i> = 1,574 participants) were included in the review. Outcomes that changed to a statistically and clinically significant extent with vitamin C were systolic BP (mean difference -6.27 [95% CI -9.60, -2.96] mmHg; <i>P</i> = 0.0002), with moderate evidence certainty, and HbA<sub>1c</sub> (-0.54% [-0.90, -0.17]; <i>P</i> = 0.004) and diastolic BP (-3.77 [-6.13, -1.42] mmHg; <i>P</i> = 0.002) with very low evidence certainty. Studies were predominantly short term (<6 months) with a small number of participants (<i>n</i> < 100). While evidence from short-term studies suggests that vitamin C supplementation may improve glycemic control and BP in people with type 2 diabetes, vitamin C supplementation cannot currently be recommended as a therapy until larger, long-term, and high-quality trials confirm these findings.",Mason SA; Keske MA; Wadley GD,Diabetes care,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472962/,0,1,0,1,0,0

33462845,A Comprehensive insight into the effect of chromium supplementation on oxidative stress indices in diabetes mellitus: A systematic review.,"Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder defined as an increase in blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia) and insufficient production or action of insulin produced by the pancreas. Chronic hyperglycaemia leads to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative stress, which consequently results in insulin resistance, beta cell degeneration, dyslipidaemia, and glucose intolerance in diabetic patients. Chromium has an essential role in the metabolism of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates through increasing insulin efficiency. This systematic review aimed to evaluate chromium supplementation's potential roles in oxidative stress indices in diabetes mellitus. A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Cochrane, and Science Direct databases until November 2020. All clinical trials and animal studies that assessed chromium's effect on oxidative stress indices in diabetes mellitus and were published in English-language journals were included. Finally, only 33 out of 633 articles met the required criteria for further analysis. Among 33 papers, 25 studies were performed on animals, and eight investigations were conducted on humans. Twenty-eight studies of chromium supplementation lead to reducing oxidative stress indices. Also, 23 studies showed that chromium supplementation markedly increased antioxidant enzymes' activity and improved levels of antioxidant indices. In conclusion, chromium supplementation decreased oxidative stress in diabetes mellitus.

33461470,The Role of Alpha-lipoic Acid Supplementation in the Prevention of Diabetes Complications: A Comprehensive Review of Clinical Trials.,"Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a substantial antioxidant in the prevention of diabetes and diabetes complications. It can regenerate other antioxidants like vitamin E, vitamin C, Coenzyme Q10 and glutathione and is often known as a universal antioxidant. Antioxidants play a role in diabetes treatment due to hyperglycemia-induced stimulation of the polyol pathway and formation of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Clinical trials examining alpha-lipoic acid supplementation on diabetic neuropathy, nephropathy, cardiomyopathy and erectile dysfunction display positive results, particularly in pain amelioration in neuropathy, asymmetric dimethylarginine reductions in nephropathy and improved oscillatory potential and contrast sensitivity in retinopathy. In diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), ALA offers protection through inhibition of NF-kB activation, reduction of fas-ligand and decrease in matrix metalloproteinase-2. This comprehensive review summarises and provides an understanding of the importance of alpha- lipoic acid supplementation to prevent diabetes complications.",Jeffrey S; Samraj PI; Raj BS,Current diabetes reviews,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33461470/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33436350,"Effect of Dietary Acetic Acid Supplementation on Plasma Glucose, Lipid Profiles, and Body Mass Index in Human Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.","Acetic acid is a short-chain fatty acid that has demonstrated biomedical potential as a dietary therapeutic agent for the management of chronic and metabolic illness comorbidities. In human beings, its consumption may improve glucose regulation and insulin sensitivity in individuals with cardiometabolic conditions and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Published clinical trial evidence evaluating its sustained supplementation effects on metabolic outcomes is inconsistent. This systematic review and meta-analysis summarized available evidence on potential therapeutic effects of dietary acetic acid supplementation via consumption of acetic acid-rich beverages and food sources on metabolic and anthropometric outcomes. A systematic search was conducted in Medline, Scopus, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, and Web of Science from database inception until October 2020. Randomized controlled trials conducted in adults evaluating the effect of dietary acetic acid supplementation for a minimum of 1 week were included. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model on fasting blood glucose (FBG), triacylglycerol (TAG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI), and body fat percentage. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by calculation of Q and I<sup>2</sup> statistics, and publication bias was assessed by calculation of Egger's regression asymmetry and Begg's test. Sixteen studies were included, involving 910 participants who consumed between 750 and 3600 mg acetic acid daily in interventions lasting an average of 8 weeks. Dietary acetic acid supplementation resulted in significant reductions in TAG concentrations in overweight and obese but otherwise healthy individuals (mean difference [MD] = -20.51 mg/dL [95% confidence intervals = -32.98, -8.04], P = .001) and people with type 2 diabetes (MD = -7.37 mg/dL [-10.15, -4.59], P < .001). Additionally, acetic acid supplementation significantly reduced FBG levels (MD = -35.73 mg/dL [-63.79, -7.67], P = .01) in subjects with type 2 diabetes compared with placebo and low-dose comparators. No other changes were seen for other metabolic or anthropometric outcomes assessed. Five of the 16 studies did not specify the dose of acetic acid delivered, and no studies measured blood acetate concentrations. Only one study controlled for background acetic acid-rich food consumption during intervention periods. Most studies had an unclear or high risk of bias. Supplementation with dietary acetic acid is well tolerated, has no adverse side effects, and has clinical potential to reduce plasma TAG and FBG concentrations in individuals with type 2 diabetes, and to reduce TAG levels in people who are overweight or obese. No significant effects of dietary acetic acid consumption were seen on HbA1c, HDL, or anthropometric markers. High-quality, longer-term studies in larger cohorts are required to confirm whether dietary acetic acid can act as an adjuvant therapeutic agent in metabolic comorbidities management.",Valdes DS; So D; Gill PA; Kellow NJ,Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33436350/,0,1,0,1,0,0
33409846,Active vitamin D supplementation and COVID-19 infections: review.,"SARS-CoV-2, causing the lethal disease COVid-19, is a public health emergency in the 2020 global pandemic. The outbreak and fast spreading of SARS-CoV-2 have a high morbidity and mortality specifically in elder patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and organ transplanted patients with immunosuppressive therapy. Preliminary results support different treatments such as chloroquine and convalescent plasma infusion in severe cases, with good outcome. On the other hand, the efficacy of supplementation with active vitamin D, an immunomodulator hormone with antiinflammatory and antimicrobial effects, is unproven. A recent study reported that vitamin D attains antiviral effects, via blocking viral replication directly. SARS-CoV-2 primarily uses the immune evasion process during infection via the envelope spike glycoprotein, which is followed by a cytokine storm, causing severe acute respiratory disease syndrome and death. SARS-CoV-2, by using the well-known angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 by the protein spike, as the host receptor to enter into alveolar, myocardial, and renal epithelial cells, can be disrupted by vitamin D. However, the correlation between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 deaths in previous studies was insignificant. Retrospective studies demonstrated a correlation between vitamin D status and COVID-19 severity and mortality, while other studies did not find this correlation. Studies have shown that, vitamin D reduces the risk of acute viral respiratory tract infections and pneumonia via direct inhibition of viral replication, antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. The data available today regarding the beneficial protective effect of vitamin D is unclear and with conflicting results. Large randomized control trials are necessary to test this hypothesis. In this review, we will explain the cross talk between the active vitamin D and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and summarize the data from the literature.",Farid N; Rola N; Koch EAT; Nakhoul N,Irish journal of medical science,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33409846/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33403957,Omega-3 fatty acids for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are defined as conditions involving decreased blood flow to the heart that can lead to heart attacks, stroke or other disorders. CVDs are a common cause of death in low- and middle-income countries. In South Africa (SA) in particular, CVD is the leading cause of death after HIV/AIDS, responsible for 1 in 6 deaths. CVD risk factors include unhealthy diets, hypertension, obesity, high cholesterol levels and diabetes. Omega-3 fatty acids may have a protective role in the risk of developing heart disease. To evaluate the consequences of an increased intake of fish and plant-based omega-3 fatty acids on the risk of CVD mortality and events. The inclusion criteria for this review were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) lasting at least 12 months, which investigated men and women aged ≥18 years. These participants had to be at any risk of CVD while receiving dietary supplements and an advised diet to promote the intake of omega-3. This diet included oily fish, fish oils and seeds rich in omega-3. Comparisons with the interventions included the participants' usual diet, no advice, no supplements, placebo or lower-dose omega-3. The review evaluated the effectiveness of these interventions on primary (e.g. CVD deaths and events), secondary (e.g. major adverse cerebrovascular or CVD events, body weight and other adiposity measures, and lipids) and tertiary (e.g. blood pressure and side-effects) outcomes. Evidence from this review indicates that increasing the intake of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (LCn3) or alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) probably has little or no effect on all-cause CVD or coronary heart disease mortality. Evidence was of moderate certainty, except for all-cause mortality, where there was a high certainty. According to moderate- to high-certainty evidence, short-chain fatty acids and LCn3 have little or no effect on mortality or cardiovascular health. However, omega-3 ALA slightly reduces the risk of CVD events and arrhythmias.",Jaca A; Durão S; Harbron J,South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33403957/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33397123,Potential health benefits of edible insects.,"Animal-based foods have traditionally been viewed as dietary staples because they provide many essential nutrients; however, edible insects have the potential to serve as healthy, sustainable alternatives to these because of their nutrient contents. Edible insects may have superior health benefits due to their high levels of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, iron, zinc, fiber, essential amino acids, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, and antioxidants. The addition of edible insects such as crickets to the human diet could offer a myriad of environmental and nutritional benefits including an overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, decreased agricultural use of land and water, improved prevention and management of chronic diseases like diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease, and enhanced immune function. Future research should aim to understand the beneficial effects of whole insects or insect isolates in comparison to traditional animal- and plant-based foodstuffs. Ultimately, insects have the potential to be used as meat substitutes or dietary supplements, resulting in human health and environmental benefits. The purpose of this review is to provide additional insight on the nutrient composition of edible insects, their potential use as meat substitutes or dietary supplements, the associated health and wellness benefits, and their potential role in exercise performance.",Nowakowski AC; Miller AC; Miller ME; Xiao H; Wu X,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33397123/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses PRISMA statement, scientific databases and the grey literature were searched, and a narrative review and risk of bias assessment were conducted. Seven randomized controlled trials were included, which had low risk of bias. Six studies were double-blind, and once single-blind, extended over 6-12 weeks, and included 50-105 participants. Conditions explored included schizophrenia, gestational diabetes, type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease, polycystic ovarian syndrome, osteopenia, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and infantile colic. Supplementation frequency was daily or bi-monthly, with mainly vitamin D3, and <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, and <i>Streptococcus</i>. Comparators were placebo, vitamin D, lower vitamin D dose, and probiotics and lower vitamin D dose. The co-supplementation yielded greater health benefits than its comparators did in all studies except in one assessing IBS. Beneficial effects included decreased disease severity, improved mental health, metabolic parameters, mainly insulin sensitivity, dyslipidemia, inflammation, and antioxidative capacity, and lower use of healthcare.

We aimed to determine the association between calcium intake and incident cardiovascular disease and mortality. Data were extracted from the European Prospective Investigation of Cancer, Norfolk (EPIC-Norfolk). Multivariable Cox regressions analysed associations between calcium intake (dietary and supplemental) and cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, aortic stenosis, peripheral vascular disease) and mortality (cardiovascular and all-cause). The results of this study were pooled with those from published prospective cohort studies in a meta-analsyis, stratifying by average calcium intake using a 700 mg/day threshold. A total of 17,968 participants aged 40-79 years were followed up for a median of 20.36 years (20.32-20.38).

33375692,Nutraceutical Strategies for Suppressing NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation: Pertinence to the Management of COVID-19 and Beyond.,"Inflammasomes are intracellular protein complexes that form in response to a variety of stress signals and that serve to catalyze the proteolytic conversion of pro-interleukin-1β and pro-interleukin-18 to active interleukin-1β and interleukin-18, central mediators of the inflammatory response; inflammasomes can also promote a type of cell death known as pyroptosis. The NLRP3 inflammasome has received the most study and plays an important pathogenic role in a vast range of pathologies associated with inflammation-including atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, the complications of diabetes, neurological and autoimmune disorders, dry macular degeneration, gout, and the cytokine storm phase of COVID-19. A consideration of the molecular biology underlying inflammasome priming and activation enables the prediction that a range of nutraceuticals may have clinical potential for suppressing inflammasome activity-antioxidants including phycocyanobilin, phase 2 inducers, melatonin, and N-acetylcysteine, the AMPK activator berberine, glucosamine, zinc, and various nutraceuticals that support generation of hydrogen sulfide.

33339580,Micronucleus frequency in chronic kidney disease patients: A review.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as a gradual loss of renal function progressing from very mild damage, with no obvious symptoms in stage one, to complete kidney failure in stage five, which ultimately requires kidney replacement therapy by organ transplantation or dialysis. Cancer incidence and other health problems, mainly diabetes and hypertension, are elevated in CKD, ultimately leading to elevated mortality. A literature search on the induction of micronuclei (MN) as endpoint for genomic damage in white blood cells and buccal mucosa cells of CKD patients was conducted. Possible associations with disease stage, treatment modalities, and vitamin or antioxidant supplementations were analyzed. In total, 26 studies were enclosed in the data analysis. Patient groups in the predialysis or hemodialysis state of the disease exhibit higher levels of genomic damage, measured as micronucleus frequency in peripheral blood lymphocytes and buccal mucosa cells, than healthy control groups. Genomic damage seems to increase with the disease stage during the predialysis phase. The association with dialysis regimens or with years on dialysis is less clear, but there are indications that efficient removal of uremic toxins is beneficial. Patients with CKD receive a variety of medications, some of which could modulate genomic damage levels and thus contribute to the observed heterogeneity. In addition, supplementation with vitamins or antioxidants may in some cases lower the genomic damage. Meta-Analysis confirmed the high and significant levels of genomic damage present in CKD patients compared to matched healthy controls. Genomic damage, as measured by the MN frequency, is elevated in CKD patients. Different strategies, including supplementation with antioxidants and optimizing dialysis processes, can reduce the levels of genomic damage and the different associated pathologies. Whether MN frequency can in the future also be used to assist in certain therapeutic decisions in CKD will have to be investigated further in larger studies.",Stopper H; Bankoglu EE; Marcos R; Pastor S,Mutation research.

33319569,Effects of vitamin D supplementation on the glycemic control of pre-diabetic individuals: a systematic review.,"Introduction: research shows the potential effect of vitamin D supplementation with an improvement in the glycemic profile of pre-diabetic patients. Objective: this study evaluates the effects of vitamin D supplementation on glycemic control markers in pre-diabetic individuals. Methods: we analyzed studies published over the last ten years, and indexed in the Science Direct, PubMed, and LILACS databases. We searched studies using health descriptors related to vitamin D, pre-diabetes, and glycemic control markers. We considered randomized controlled trials eligible for inclusion. All phases of selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were carried out by two independent evaluators. Results: we identified 309 articles, of which 4 met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 3 studies have shown that vitamin D supplementation does not alter glycemic control markers in pre-diabetic individuals. Only one study showed a positive effect after supplementation with 60,000 IU/month of vitamin D3 for 12 months, with a significant reduction in the concentrations of glycated hemoglobin, fasting glucose, and two-hour postprandial glucose. Conclusion: there is insufficient scientific evidence to confirm the beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation on glycemic control markers in pre-diabetic individuals.",Lima CHR; Layanne LCCL; Nogueira NDN; Rodrigues GP; Frota KMG; Teixeira NDSCCA; Oliveira IKF; Paiva AA,Nutricion hospitalaria,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33319569/,0,1,0,0,0,0

33266114,A Meta-Analysis of the Impact of Resveratrol Supplementation on Markers of Renal Function and Blood Pressure in Type 2 Diabetic Patients on Hypoglycemic Therapy.,"Evidence on the beneficial effects of resveratrol supplementation on cardiovascular disease-related profiles in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is conflicting, while its impact on renal function and blood pressure measurements remains to be established in these patients. The current meta-analysis included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on the impact of resveratrol supplementation on markers of renal function and blood pressure in patients with T2D on hypoglycemic medication. Electronic databases such as MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and EMBASE were searched for eligible studies from inception up to June 2020. The random and fixed effects model was used in the meta-analysis. A total of five RCTs met the inclusion criteria and involved 388 participants with T2D. Notably, most of the participants were on metformin therapy, or metformin in combination with other hypoglycemic drugs such as insulin and glibenclamide. Pooled estimates showed that resveratrol supplementation in patients with T2D lowered the levels of fasting glucose (SMD: -0.06 [95% CI: -0.24, 0.12]; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 4%, p = 0.39) and insulin (SMD: -0.08 [95% CI: -0.50, 0.34], <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 73%, p = 0.002) when compared to those on placebo. In addition, supplementation significantly lowered systolic blood pressure (SMD: -5.77 [95% CI: -8.61, -2.93], <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 66%, p = 0.02) in these patients. Although resveratrol supplementation did not affect creatinine or urea levels, it reduced the total protein content (SMD: -0.19 [95% CI: -0.36, -0.02]; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 91%, p = 0.001). In all, resveratrol supplementation in hypoglycemic therapy improves glucose control and lowers blood pressure; however, additional evidence is necessary to confirm its effect on renal function in patients with T2D.",Nyambuya TM; Nkambule BB; Mazibuko-Mbeje SE; Mxinwa V; Mokgalaboni K; Orlando P; Silvestri S; Louw J; Tiano L; Dludla PV,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33266114/,0,0,0,1,0,0

Various natural compounds derived from plants are associated with beneficial effects on the incidence and progression of MetS. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Capsicum annuum on factors related to MetS by assessing randomized controlled trials (written in English). We searched the online databases of PubMed, Embase, Google scholar, and Cochrane Library up to April 2020. 'Patient/Population, Intervention, Comparison and Outcomes' format was used to determine whether intervention with C. annuum supplementation compared with placebo supplementation had any effect on the components of MetS among participants. We considered standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as effect size measures using random-effects model. Analysis of the included 11 studies (n = 609) showed that C. annuum supplementation had significant effect on low density lipoprotein-cholesterol [SMD = - 0.39; 95% CI - 0.72, - 0.07; P = 0.02; prediction interval, - 1.28 to 0.50] and marginally significant effect on body weight [SMD = - 0.19; 95% CI - 0.40, 0.03; P = 0.09].

33255206,Medicinal Potential of Isoflavonoids: Polyphenols That May Cure Diabetes.,"In recent years, there is emerging evidence that isoflavonoids, either dietary or obtained from traditional medicinal plants, could play an important role as a supplementary drug in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) due to their reported pronounced biological effects in relation to multiple metabolic factors associated with diabetes. Hence, in this regard, we have comprehensively reviewed the potential biological effects of isoflavonoids, particularly biochanin A, genistein, daidzein, glycitein, and formononetin on metabolic disorders and long-term complications induced by T2DM in order to understand whether they can be future candidates as a safe antidiabetic agent. Based on in-depth in vitro and in vivo studies evaluations, isoflavonoids have been found to activate gene expression through the stimulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) (α, γ), modulate carbohydrate metabolism, regulate hyperglycemia, induce dyslipidemia, lessen insulin resistance, and modify adipocyte differentiation and tissue metabolism. Moreover, these natural compounds have also been found to attenuate oxidative stress through the oxidative signaling process and inflammatory mechanism. Hence, isoflavonoids have been envisioned to be able to prevent and slow down the progression of long-term diabetes complications including cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Further thoroughgoing investigations in human clinical studies are strongly recommended to obtain the optimum and specific dose and regimen required for supplementation with isoflavonoids and derivatives in diabetic patients.",Ahmed QU; Ali AHM; Mukhtar S; Alsharif MA; Parveen H; Sabere ASM; Nawi MSM; Khatib A; Siddiqui MJ; Umar A; Alhassan AM,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33255206/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33220625,The effect of cinnamon supplementation on lipid profiles in patients with type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials.,"The present systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of cinnamon supplementation on blood lipid profiles in patients with type 2 diabetes. A systematic search (with no language restrictions) was performed in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library to identify relevant clinical trials up to 8th March 2020. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were pooled based on the random-effects model. Heterogeneity, publication bias, and sensitivity analyses were performed based on standard methods. Sixteen studies, involving 1025 participants, were included in the meta-analysis. This study found a significant decrease in triglycerides (TG) (WMD: -26.27 mg/dl, 95 % CI: [-38.93, -13.61], P < 0.001), total cholesterol (TC) (WMD: -13.93 mg/dl, 95 % CI: [-25.64, -2.22], P = 0.020), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (WMD: -6.13 mg/dl, 95 % CI: [-10.72, -1.53], P = 0.009), while no change was observed on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) concentration (WMD: 0.64 mg/dl, 95 % CI: [-0.18, 1.46], P = 0.128), in patients with type 2 diabetes. The reduction in TG, TC, and LDL-C was greater in; Eastern compared to Western countries, and studies with a duration of < 2 compared to ≥ 2 months. The increase in HDL was greater in; participants with a BMI ≥ 30 compared to <30, Western compared to Eastern countries, and intervention durations of ≥ 2 compared to < 2 months.

33218062,A Novel Promising Frontier for Human Health: The Beneficial Effects of Nutraceuticals in Cardiovascular Diseases.,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and diabetes are a significant public health problem worldwide. Although several novel pharmacological treatments to reduce the progression of CVDs have been discovered during the last 20 years, the better way to contain the onset of CVDs remains prevention. In this regard, nutraceuticals seem to own a great potential in maintaining human health, exerting important protective cardiovascular effects. In the last years, there has been increased focus on identifying natural compounds with cardiovascular health-promoting effects and also to characterize the molecular mechanisms involved. Although many review articles have focused on the individual natural compound impact on cardiovascular diseases, the aim of this manuscript was to examine the role of the most studied nutraceuticals, such as resveratrol, cocoa, quercetin, curcumin, brassica, berberine and Spirulina platensis, on different CVDs.",Carrizzo A; Izzo C; Forte M; Sommella E; Di Pietro P; Venturini E; Ciccarelli M; Galasso G; Rubattu S; Campiglia P; Sciarretta S; Frati G; Vecchione C,International journal of molecular sciences,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33218062/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We aimed to evaluate the effects of green tea supplementation on serum concentrations of adiponectin in patients with T2DM. A systematic search was performed on the ISI Web of Science, PubMed, Embase and Scopus to find articles related to the effects of the green tea supplementation on adiponectin concentrations in T2DM patients, up to June 2019. Meta-analyses were performed using both the random and fixed effects model where appropriate. The initial search yielded 1010 publications. Data were pooled from five trials including 333 patients with T2DM. A meta-analysis of five RCTs demonstrated that green tea supplementation significantly increased adiponectin concentrations compared to control groups.

33214054,Reducing the Risk of Stroke in Patients with Impaired Renal Function: Nutritional Issues.,"Patients with renal failure have extremely high cardiovascular risk; in dialysis patients the risk of stroke is increased approximately 10-fold over that in the general population. Reasons include not only a high prevalence of traditional risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia, but also the accumulation of toxic substances that are eliminated by the kidneys, so have very high levels in patients with renal failure. These include plasma total homocysteine, asymmetric dimethylarginine, thiocyanate, and toxic products of the intestinal microbiome (Gut-Derived Uremic Toxins; GDUT), which include trimethylamine N- oxide (TMAO), produced from phosphatidylcholine (largely from egg yolk) and carnitine (largely from red meat). Other GDUT are produced from amino acids, largely from meat consumption. Deficiency of vitamin B12 is very common, raises plasma tHcy, and is easily treated. However, cyanocobalamin is toxic in patients with renal failure. To reduce the risk of stroke in renal failure it is important to limit the intake of meat, avoid egg yolk, and use methylcobalamin instead of cyanocobalamin, in addition to folic acid.",Spence JD,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33214054/,1,0,0,0,0,0

33198366,Effect of Probiotic Supplementation on Newborn Birth Weight for Mother with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus or Overweight/Obesity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"High birth weight indicates the future risk of obesity and increased fat mass in childhood. Maternal gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) or overweight are powerful predictors of high birth weight. Studies on probiotic supplementation during pregnancy have reported its benefits in modulating gut microbiota composition and improving glucose and lipid metabolism in pregnant women. Therefore, probiotic intervention during pregnancy was proposed to interrupt the transmission of obesity from mothers to newborns. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the effect of probiotic intervention in pregnant women with GDM or overweight on newborn birth weight. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases up to 18 December 2019. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pregnant women with GDM or overweight who received probiotic intervention during pregnancy with those receiving placebo were eligible for the analysis. Newborn birth weights were pooled to calculate the mean difference with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Two reviewers assessed the trial quality and extracted data independently. Seven RCTs involving 1093 participants were included in the analysis. Compared with the placebo, probiotics had little effect on newborn birth weight of pregnant women with GDM or overweight (mean difference = -10.27, 95% CI = -90.17 to 69.63, <i>p</i> = 0.801). The subgroup analysis revealed that probiotic intake by women with GDM decreased newborn birth weight, whereas probiotic intake by obese pregnant women increased newborn birth weight. Thus, no evidence indicates that probiotic intake by pregnant women with GDM or overweight can control newborn birth weight.",Wang CC; Tung YT; Chang HC; Lin CH; Chen YC,Nutrients,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33198366/,0,1,0,1,0,0
33197598,The effects of chromium supplementation on lipidprofile in humans: A systematic review and meta-analysis ofrandomized controlled trials.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of chromium supplementation on lipid profile consisting of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) in humans. The PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of sciences, Google Scholar and Cochrane library were systematically searched for randomised control trails (RCTs) available which published before August 2020. The meta-analysis was conducted using Random or fixed-effects models, and between-study heterogeneity was assessed by I<sup>2</sup>. Thirty-eight studies comprising 41 treatment arms and 7605 participants included to the present meta-analysis. Our results of overall analysis show only a significant reduction in serum TC level in response to chromium supplementation (WMD: -0.17 mmol/l, 95 % CI: -0.27, -0.07, P = 0.001). In accordance with the results of the subgroup analyses, the lowering-effect of chromium supplementation may be synergist during short-term (less than 12 weeks), low dose (less than 200), diabetics patient, younger adults (less than 54 years) and picolinate and elemental form for TC, older and non-obese subjects (>54 years and ≤ 29 kg/m2, respectively), women, Asian and Australian and picolinate form for TG, short-term, low dose, non-obese subjects, women, and Asian for VLDL, and nicotinate form for HDL-C, but had no effect on LDL-C. Our meta-analysis reveals that there was only an overall significant association between chromium supplementation with decreases in the concentration of TC. Additionally, we found considerable evidence of subgroup analysis that support a significant lowering effect of chromium supplementation on TC, TG and VLDL. Further RCTs with short-term and low dose chromium supplementation in subjects with diabetes are necessitated for a firm conclusion of the lipid-modulating properties.",Tarrahi MJ; Tarrahi MA; Rafiee M; Mansourian M,Pharmacological research,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33197598/,0,1,0,1,0,0
33187365,Versatile Nutraceutical Potentials of Watermelon-A Modest Fruit Loaded with Pharmaceutically Valuable Phytochemicals.,"Watermelon (<i>Citrulus lantus</i>) is an important horticultural crop which belongs to the Curcubitaceae family. The nutraceutical potential of watermelon has been illustrated by several researchers, which makes it a better choice of functional food. Watermelon has been used to treat various ailments, such as cardio-vascular diseases, aging related ailments, obesity, diabetes, ulcers, and various types of cancers. The medicinal properties of watermelon are attributed by the presence of important phytochemicals with pharmaceutical values such as lycopene, citrulline, and other polyphenolic compounds. Watermelon acts as vital source of l-citrulline, a neutral-alpha amino acid which is the precursor of l-arginine, an essential amino acid necessary for protein synthesis. Supplementation of l-citrulline and lycopene displayed numerous health benefits in in vitro and in vivo studies. Similarly, the dietary intake of watermelon has proven benefits as functional food in humans for weight management. Apart from the fruits, the extracts prepared from the seeds, sprouts, and leaves also evidenced medicinal properties. The present review provides a comprehensive overview of benefits of watermelon for the treatment of various ailments.",Manivannan A; Lee ES; Han K; Lee HE; Kim DS,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33187365/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33182024,Gut microbiome and multiple sclerosis: New insights and perspective.,"The human gastrointestinal microbiota, also known as the gut microbiota living in the human gastrointestinal tract, has been shown to have a significant impact on several human disorders including rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, obesity, and multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is an inflammatory disease characterized by the destruction of the spinal cord and nerve cells in the brain due to an attack of immune cells, causing a wide range of harmful symptoms related to inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS). Despite extensive studies on MS that have shown that many external and genetic factors are involved in its pathogenesis, the exact role of external factors in the pathophysiology of MS is still unclear. Recent studies on MS and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of encephalitis, have shown that intestinal microbiota may play a key role in the pathogenesis of MS. Therefore, modification of the intestinal microbiome could be a promising strategy for the future treatment of MS. In this study, the characteristics of intestinal microbiota, the relationship between intestine and brain despite the blood-brain barrier, various factors involved in intestinal microbiota modification, changes in intestinal microbial composition in MS, intestinal microbiome modification strategies, and possible use of intestinal microbiome and factors affecting it have been discussed.",Esmaeil Amini M; Shomali N; Bakhshi A; Rezaei S; Hemmatzadeh M; Hosseinzadeh R; Eslami S; Babaie F; Aslani S; Torkamandi S; Mohammadi H,International immunopharmacology,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33182024/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33162192,Effects of soluble fiber supplementation on glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Soluble dietary fiber is prompted as an important part of reducing blood glucose, ameliorating insulin resistance and controlling body weight. Thus, we performed this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to quantify and synthesize the effects of soluble fiber supplementation on glycemic control and BMI modification in adults with type 2 diabetes. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane databases until February 13, 2020 to identify RCTs that detected the effects of soluble fiber supplementation on glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. A random-effects model with the generic inverse variance method was used to analyze the pooled data. The meta-regression and subgroup analyses were conducted to identify the variables that influenced the pooled results. The robust error meta-regression model was used to conduct the dose-response test. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system was undertaken to evaluate the overall quality of the evidence. A total of 29 RCTs (33 comparisons) involving 1517 participants were identified in this meta-analysis. Results showed that supplemental soluble dietary fiber significantly reduced glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c, MD -0.63%, 95% CI [-0.90, -0.37]; P < 0.00001), fasting plasma glucose (FPG, MD -0.89 mmol/L, 95% CI [-1.28, -0.51]; P < 0.00001), fasting insulin (SMD -0.48, 95% CI [-0.80, -0.17]; P = 0.003), homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, SMD -0.58, 95% CI [-0.86, -0.29], P < 0.0001), fructosamine (SMD -1.03, 95% CI [-1.51, -0.55]; P < 0.0001), 2-h postprandial plasma glucose (SMD -0.74, 95% CI [-1.00, -0.48]; P < 0.00001), and BMI (SMD -0.31, 95% CI [-0.61, -0.00], P = 0.05) compared with control diets in patients with type 2 diabetes. Specifically, dose-response meta-analyses presented that a daily dosage of 7.6-8.3 g was recommended. Intake of soluble fiber supplementation is effective in improving glycemic control and BMI level in type 2 diabetes and is also a convenient way to help individuals meet standard dietary fiber needs. But due to the evidence of substantial heterogeneity in most pooled estimates, further long-term and high-quality RCTs are needed.",Xie Y; Gou L; Peng M; Zheng J; Chen L,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33162192/,0,1,0,1,0,0
33153126,Inositol and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: A Systematic Review on Deficiencies and Supplementation.,"Liver lipid accumulation is a hallmark of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), broadly associated with insulin resistance. Inositols (INS) are ubiquitous polyols implied in many physiological functions. They are produced endogenously, are present in many foods and in dietary supplements. Alterations in INS metabolism seems to play a role in diseases involving insulin resistance such as diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome. Given its role in other metabolic syndromes, the hypothesis of an INS role as a supplement in NAFLD is intriguing. We performed a systematic review of the literature to find preclinical and clinical evidence of INS supplementation efficacy in NAFLD patients. We retrieved 10 studies on animal models assessing Myoinosiol or Pinitol deficiency or supplementation and one human randomized controlled trial (RCT). Overall, INS deficiency was associated with increased fatty liver in animals. Conversely, INS supplementation in animal models of fatty liver reduced hepatic triglycerides and cholesterol accumulation and maintained a normal ultrastructural liver histopathology. In the one included RCT, Pinitol supplementation obtained similar results. Pinitol significantly reduced liver fat, post-prandial triglycerides, AST levels, lipid peroxidation increasing glutathione peroxidase activity. These results, despite being limited, indicate the need for further evaluation of INS in NAFLD in larger clinical trials.",Pani A; Giossi R; Menichelli D; Fittipaldo VA; Agnelli F; Inglese E; Romandini A; Roncato R; Pintaudi B; Del Sole F; Scaglione F,Nutrients,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33153126/,0,1,0,0,0,0
33150030,"Risks of Skin, Hair, and Nail Supplements.","Skin, hair, and nail supplements, sometimes referred to as ""beauty supplements"" or ""ingestible skin care,"" are a large and growing industry. These products may contain vitamins and minerals, sometimes in very high doses. They may also contain herbs, hormones, microbes, or animal derivatives such as fish oils and collagen powders. Dietary supplements are regulated as foods, not as drugs, by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Therefore, manufacturers do not need to provide any proof of safety, efficacy, or quality prior to sale. This is of serious concern, as many adverse effects due to supplement components have been reported. The potential risks cover multiple categories. These include acute toxicities, such as choking, as well as chronic toxicities, such as increased risk of diabetes. Teratogenicity and interactions with drugs and laboratory testing have been documented in research studies. Other risks include potentially increased risk of cancer with long-term use, allergic reactions, and others. It is vital that physicians educate their patients on these risks. As no post-marketing surveillance programs are required for supplements, our understanding of supplement risks is incomplete.

33126575,Vitamin D and Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Fatty Liver Disease (MAFLD): An Update.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the first cause of chronic liver disease worldwide; it ranges from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis (NASH) and, potentially, cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma. NAFLD is also an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and mortality. As it is largely associated with insulin resistance and related disorders, NAFLD has been recently re-named as Metabolic dysfunction-Associated Fatty Liver Disease (MAFLD). At present, there are no approved pharmacological treatments for this condition. Vitamin D is a molecule with extensive anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory, and insulin-sensitizing properties, which have been proven also in hepatic cells and is involved in immune-metabolic pathways within the gut-adipose tissue-liver axis. Epidemiological data support a relationship hypovitaminosis D and the presence of NAFLD and steatohepatitis (NASH); however, results from vitamin D supplementation trials on liver outcomes are controversial. This narrative review provides an overview of the latest evidence on pathophysiological pathways connecting vitamin D to NAFLD, with emphasis on the effects of vitamin D treatment in MAFLD by a nonsystematic literature review of PubMed published clinical trials. This article conforms to the Scale for Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) guidelines. Evidence so far available supports the hypothesis of potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation in selected populations of NAFLD patients, as those with shorter disease duration and mild to moderate liver damage.",Barchetta I; Cimini FA; Cavallo MG,Nutrients,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33126575/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33097528,UEFA expert group statement on nutrition in elite football. Current evidence to inform practical recommendations and guide future research.,"Football is a global game which is constantly evolving, showing substantial increases in physical and technical demands. Nutrition plays a valuable integrated role in optimising performance of elite players during training and match-play, and maintaining their overall health throughout the season. An evidence-based approach to nutrition emphasising, a 'food first' philosophy (ie, food over supplements), is fundamental to ensure effective player support. This requires relevant scientific evidence to be applied according to the constraints of what is practical and feasible in the football setting. The science underpinning sports nutrition is evolving fast, and practitioners must be alert to new developments. In response to these developments, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) has gathered experts in applied sports nutrition research as well as practitioners working with elite football clubs and national associations/federations to issue an expert statement on a range of topics relevant to elite football nutrition: (1) match day nutrition, (2) training day nutrition, (3) body composition, (4) stressful environments and travel, (5) cultural diversity and dietary considerations, (6) dietary supplements, (7) rehabilitation, (8) referees and (9) junior high-level players.

33082439,Improvement of glucose metabolism in pregnant women through probiotic supplementation depends on gestational diabetes status: meta-analysis.,"The aim of this study was to assess the effects of probiotic and synbiotic supplementation on glucose metabolism in pregnant women using data from randomized controlled trials. Furthermore, this meta-analysis examines whether the observed effects depend on the presence or absence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and if the effect is dependent on the type of supplement used (probiotic or synbiotic). We performed a literature search of databases (Medline, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, and Cochrane Library) and identified all relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published prior to May 2019. We compared the effects of probiotic supplementation with the administration of placebos in pregnant women with and without GDM. The systematic review and meta-analysis protocol were registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews as number CRD 42019111467. 1119 study participants from 15 selected studies were included. The participants in four studies did not have GDM (being recruited to the study before week 20 of pregnancy) and the participants in the rest of the studies were diagnosed with GDM between weeks 24 and 28 of gestation. The meta-analysis showed that supplementation lowers serum glucose, insulin levels, and HOMA-IR index, but only in pregnant women with GDM. Moreover, both probiotics and synbiotics lower serum insulin level and HOMA-IR index, but the glucose lowering effect is specific only to probiotics and not synbiotics. Probiotic supplementation may improve glucose metabolism in pregnant women with GDM. There is a need for more RCT studies with larger groups to better estimate this effect.",Łagowska K; Malinowska AM; Zawieja B; Zawieja E,Scientific reports,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33082439/,0,1,0,1,0,0
33081260,The Benefits of Flavonoids in Diabetic Retinopathy.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR), one of the most common complications of diabetes, is the leading cause of legal blindness among adults of working age in developed countries. After 20 years of diabetes, almost all patients suffering from type I diabetes mellitus and about 60% of type II diabetics have DR. Several studies have tried to identify drugs and therapies to treat DR though little attention has been given to flavonoids, one type of polyphenols, which can be found in high levels mainly in fruits and vegetables, but also in other foods such as grains, cocoa, green tea or even in red wine. Flavonoids have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiviral effects. Since it is known that diabetes induces oxidative stress and inflammation in the retina leading to neuronal death in the early stages of the disease, the use of these compounds can prove to be beneficial in the prevention or treatment of DR. In this review, we summarize the molecular and cellular effects of flavonoids in the diabetic retina.",Matos AL; Bruno DF; Ambrósio AF; Santos PF,Nutrients,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33081260/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33080891,Curcumin: Could This Compound Be Useful in Pregnancy and Pregnancy-Related Complications?,"Curcumin, the main polyphenol contained in turmeric root (<i>Curcuma longa</i>), has played a significant role in medicine for centuries. The growing interest in plant-derived substances has led to increased consumption of them also in pregnancy. The pleiotropic and multi-targeting actions of curcumin have made it very attractive as a health-promoting compound. In spite of the beneficial effects observed in various chronic diseases in humans, limited and fragmentary information is currently available about curcumin's effects on pregnancy and pregnancy-related complications. It is known that immune-metabolic alterations occurring during pregnancy have consequences on both maternal and fetal tissues, leading to short- and long-term complications. The reported anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitoxicant, neuroprotective, immunomodulatory, antiapoptotic, antiangiogenic, anti-hypertensive, and antidiabetic properties of curcumin appear to be encouraging, not only for the management of pregnancy-related disorders, including gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), preeclampsia (PE), depression, preterm birth, and fetal growth disorders but also to contrast damage induced by natural and chemical toxic agents. The current review summarizes the latest data, mostly obtained from animal models and in vitro studies, on the impact of curcumin on the molecular mechanisms involved in pregnancy pathophysiology, with the aim to shed light on the possible beneficial and/or adverse effects of curcumin on pregnancy outcomes.",Filardi T; Varì R; Ferretti E; Zicari A; Morano S; Santangelo C,Nutrients,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33080891/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33066702,Vitamin C and the Lens: New Insights into Delaying the Onset of Cataract.,"Cataracts or clouding of the lens is the leading cause of blindness in the world. Age and diabetes are major risk factors, and with an increasing aging and diabetic population, the burden of cataracts will grow. Cataract surgery is an effective way to restore vision; however, alternatives to cataract surgery are required to reduce the looming cataract epidemic. Since it is well established that oxidative damage plays a major role in the etiology of cataracts, antioxidants have been promoted as therapies to delay and/or prevent cataracts. However, many antioxidant interventions including vitamin C have produced mixed results as anti-cataract therapies. Progress has been made towards our understanding of lens physiology and the mechanisms involved in the delivery and uptake of antioxidants to the lens which may guide future studies aimed at addressing some of the inconsistencies seen in previous animal and human studies. Of interest is the potential for vitamin C based supplements in delaying the onset of cataracts post vitrectomy which occurs in up to 80% of patients within two years. These targeted approaches are required to reduce the burden of cataract on hospitals and improve the quality of life of our aging and diabetic population.",Lim JC; Caballero Arredondo M; Braakhuis AJ; Donaldson PJ,Nutrients,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33066702/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33066504,Effects of Polyphenols on Insulin Resistance.,"Insulin resistance (IR) is apparent when tissues responsible for clearing glucose from the blood, such as adipose and muscle, do not respond properly to appropriate signals. IR is estimated based on fasting blood glucose and insulin, but some measures also incorporate an oral glucose challenge. Certain (poly)phenols, as supplements or in foods, can improve insulin resistance by several mechanisms including lowering postprandial glucose, modulating glucose transport, affecting insulin signalling pathways, and by protecting against damage to insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cells. As shown by intervention studies on volunteers, the most promising candidates for improving insulin resistance are (-)-epicatechin, (-)-epicatechin-containing foods and anthocyanins. It is possible that quercetin and phenolic acids may also be active, but data from intervention studies are mixed. Longer term and especially dose-response studies on mildly insulin resistant participants are required to establish the extent to which (poly)phenols and (poly)phenol-rich foods may improve insulin resistance in compromised groups.",Williamson G; Sheedy K,Nutrients,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33066504/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33064751,The association between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D metabolites and type 2 diabetes in European populations: A meta-analysis and Mendelian randomisation analysis.,"Prior research suggested a differential association of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) metabolites with type 2 diabetes (T2D), with total 25(OH)D and 25(OH)D3 inversely associated with T2D, but the epimeric form (C3-epi-25(OH)D3) positively associated with T2D. Whether or not these observational associations are causal remains uncertain. We aimed to examine the potential causality of these associations using Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis. We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for total 25(OH)D (N = 120,618), 25(OH)D3 (N = 40,562), and C3-epi-25(OH)D3 (N = 40,562) in participants of European descent (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition [EPIC]-InterAct study, EPIC-Norfolk study, EPIC-CVD study, Ely study, and the SUNLIGHT consortium). We identified genetic variants for MR analysis to investigate the causal association of the 25(OH)D metabolites with T2D (including 80,983 T2D cases and 842,909 non-cases). We also estimated the observational association of 25(OH)D metabolites with T2D by performing random effects meta-analysis of results from previous studies and results from the EPIC-InterAct study. We identified 10 genetic loci associated with total 25(OH)D, 7 loci associated with 25(OH)D3 and 3 loci associated with C3-epi-25(OH)D3. Based on the meta-analysis of observational studies, each 1-standard deviation (SD) higher level of 25(OH)D was associated with a 20% lower risk of T2D (relative risk [RR]: 0.80; 95% CI 0.77, 0.84; p < 0.001), but a genetically predicted 1-SD increase in 25(OH)D was not significantly associated with T2D (odds ratio [OR]: 0.96; 95% CI 0.89, 1.03; p = 0.23); this result was consistent across sensitivity analyses. In EPIC-InterAct, 25(OH)D3 (per 1-SD) was associated with a lower risk of T2D (RR: 0.81; 95% CI 0.77, 0.86; p < 0.001), while C3-epi-25(OH)D3 (above versus below lower limit of quantification) was positively associated with T2D (RR: 1.12; 95% CI 1.03, 1.22; p = 0.006), but neither 25(OH)D3 (OR: 0.97; 95% CI 0.93, 1.01; p = 0.14) nor C3-epi-25(OH)D3 (OR: 0.98; 95% CI 0.93, 1.04; p = 0.53) was causally associated with T2D risk in the MR analysis. Main limitations include the lack of a non-linear MR analysis and of the generalisability of the current findings from European populations to other populations of different ethnicities. Our study found discordant associations of biochemically measured and genetically predicted differences in blood 25(OH)D with T2D risk. The findings based on MR analysis in a large sample of European ancestry do not support a causal association of total 25(OH)D or 25(OH)D metabolites with T2D and argue against the use of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of T2D.",Zheng JS; Luan J; Sofianopoulou E; Sharp SJ; Day FR; Imamura F; Gundersen TE; Lotta LA; Sluijs I; Stewart ID; Shah RL; van der Schouw YT; Wheeler E; Ardanaz E; Boeing H; Dorronsoro M; Dahm CC; Dimou N; El-Fatouhi D; Franks PW; Fagherazzi G; Grioni S; Huerta JM; Heath AK; Hansen L; Jenab M; Jakszyn P; Kaaks R; Kühn T; Khaw KT; Laouali N; Masala G; Nilsson PM; Overvad K; Olsen A; Panico S; Quirós JR; Rolandsson O; Rodríguez-Barranco M; Sacerdote C; Spijkerman AMW; Tong TYN; Tumino R; Tsilidis KK; Danesh J; Riboli E; Butterworth AS; Langenberg C; Forouhi NG; Wareham NJ,PLoS medicine,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33064751/,0,0,0,1,0,0
33053603,Medicinal plants and bioactive natural compounds as inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase: A literature review.,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are one of the most important causes for mortality worldwide. Elevated levels of total cholesterol, and particularly LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) are the main risk factor for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and ischemic heart disease. The risk of CVDs could be reduced by decreasing the elevated cholesterol levels. β-hydroxy β-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCoAR) is the primary and rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Recently, the crucial role of nutraceuticals in maintaining normal physiological function was established. Nutraceuticals play an important role in preventing several non-communicable diseases such as obesity, CVDs, cancer, diabetes, and reducing hyperlipidemia. Although the effect of nutraceuticals and herbal medicine on CVDs and dyslipidemia was previously investigated thoroughly, the effect of these natural products on HMGCoAR as one of the important enzymes involved in CVDs etiopathogenesis has not yet been investigated. Therefore, the major aim of this paper was to review the effects of nutraceuticals and medicinal plants on HMGCoAR. Results indicate that different types of natural foods, isolated nutrients, herbal products, and dietary supplements as nutraceuticals decrease the expression and activity of HMGCoAR. This review shows that medicinal plants and nutraceuticals could be used to decrease HMGCoAR activity as accessible and convenient and economical natural compounds to prevent dyslipidemia and CVDs.",Mahdavi A; Bagherniya M; Fakheran O; Reiner Ž; Xu S; Sahebkar A,"BioFactors (Oxford, England)",2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33053603/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33050862,Engineered Probiotic and Prebiotic Nutraceutical Supplementations in Combating Non-communicable Disorders: A Review.,"Nutritional supplementations are a form of nutrition sources that may help in improving the health complexities of a person throughout his or her life span. Being also categorized as food supplementations, nutraceuticals are products that are extracted from edible sources with medical benefits as well as primary nutritional values. Nutraceuticals can be considered as functional foods. There are evidences that nutraceutical supplementations can alter the commensal gut microbiota and help to prevent or fight against chronic non-communicable degenerative diseases in adults, including neurological disorders (Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD], Parkinson's disease [PD], Multiple sclerosis [MS]) and metabolic disorders (Type-II diabetes, obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease). They can even lessen the complexities of preterm babies like extra-uterine growth restriction, necrotizing enterocolitis, infant eczema and allergy (during pregnancy) as well as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Molecular perception of inflammatory and apoptotic modulators regulating the pathogenesis of these health risks, their control and management by probiotics and prebiotics could further emphasize the scientific overview of their utility. In this study, the pivotal role of nutraceutical supplementations in regulating or modulating molecular pathways in the above non-communicable diseases is briefly described. This work also gives an overall introduction of the sophisticated genome-editing techniques and advanced delivery systems in therapeutic activities applicable under these health risks.",Kerry RG; Das G; Golla U; Del Pilar Rodriguez-Torres M; Shin HS; Patra JK,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33050862/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33047412,Revisiting pharmacological potentials of Nigella sativa seed: A promising option for COVID-19 prevention and cure.,"Nigella sativa seed and its active compounds have been historically recognized as an effective herbal panacea that can establish a balanced inflammatory response by suppressing chronic inflammation and promoting healthy immune response. The essential oil and other preparations of N. sativa seed have substantial therapeutic outcomes against immune disturbance, autophagy dysfunction, oxidative stress, ischemia, inflammation, in several COVID-19 comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, Kawasaki-like diseases, and many bacterial and viral infections. Compelling evidence in the therapeutic efficiency of N. sativa along with the recent computational findings is strongly suggestive of combating emerged COVID-19 pandemic. Also, being an available candidate in nutraceuticals, N. sativa seed oil could be immensely potential and feasible to prevent and cure COVID-19. This review was aimed at revisiting the pharmacological benefits of N. sativa seed and its active metabolites that may constitute a potential basis for developing a novel preventive and therapeutic strategy against COVID-19. Bioactive compounds of N. sativa seed, especially thymiquinone, α-hederin, and nigellidine, could be alternative and promising herbal drugs to combat COVID-19. Preclinical and clinical trials are required to delineate detailed mechanism of N. sativa's active components and to investigate their efficacy and potency under specific pathophysiological conditions of COVID-19.",Islam MN; Hossain KS; Sarker PP; Ferdous J; Hannan MA; Rahman MM; Chu DT; Uddin MJ,Phytotherapy research : PTR,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33047412/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33047170,"The effect of probiotics, prebiotics or synbiotics on metabolic outcomes in individuals with diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","The aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials assessing the effect of probiotic, prebiotic or synbiotic supplementation on gut microbiota and glucose control and lipid levels in individuals with diabetes. MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library were searched. The eligibility criteria for the studies was involvement of participants with a diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Metabolic outcomes (glucose control, insulinaemia, and lipid profile) of any probiotic, prebiotic or synbiotic supplementation related to modification of gut microbiota (prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics) were analysed. We provided a narrative synthesis and meta-analysis of the findings on metabolic outcomes from the studies. Metabolic outcomes were extracted post-intervention and expressed as mean differences (MDs) and 95% CIs between treatment and comparator groups. We pooled the results using a random-effects meta-analysis. The meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager (RevMan) software. After the removal of duplicates and ineligible studies, 5219 studies were retained for review of titles and abstracts. The number of articles was reduced to 130 by review, for which the full-text articles were obtained and reassessed, 38 of which were included in the final meta-analysis. Overall, the use of prebiotics, probiotics or synbiotics reduced HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels, but did not reach the threshold for significance (-2.17 mmol/mol, 95% CI -4.37, 0.03; p = 0.05, [-0.20%, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.00; p = 0.05, I<sup>2</sup> = 66%]) and had no effect on LDL-cholesterol levels (-0.05 mmol/l; 95% CI -0.14, 0.05, p = 0.35, I<sup>2</sup> = 37%). However, their consumption decreased levels of fasting blood glucose (-0.58 mmol/l; 95% CI -0.86, -0.30; p < 0.01, I<sup>2</sup> = 60%), total cholesterol (-0.14 mmol/l; 95% CI -0.26, -0.02, p = 0.02, I<sup>2</sup> = 39%), triacylglycerols (-0.11 mmol/l; 95% CI -0.20, -0.02, p = 0.01, I<sup>2</sup>= 21%) and insulinaemia (-10.51 pmol/l; 95% CI -16.68,-4.33, p < 0.01, I<sup>2</sup> = 74%), and increased HDL-cholesterol levels (0.04 mmol/l; 95% CI 0.01, 0.07, p < 0.01, I<sup>2</sup>= 24%). In individuals with diabetes mellitus, supplementation with probiotics, prebiotics or synbiotics improved metabolic variables, although the magnitude of this effect is low.

33045979,Vitamin D Supplementation in Diabetic Foot Ulcers: A Current Perspective.,"Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a major complication of diabetes mellitus, as it can physically and emotionally impact the person. Its management can be challenging and expensive, depending on the severity of the wound and the presence of infection. The fat-soluble molecule, vitamin D, has gained great importance ever since its pleiotropism has been recognized. Its efficacy could be attributed to the presence of vitamin D receptors in most of the body tissues. Vitamin D plays a significant role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and immune modulation. It modulates the T and B cells resulting in the suppression of the immunoglobulins, autoimmunity, and inflammation. We performed a literature search with the objective to highlight the role of vitamin D in peripheral vascular disease and peripheral neuropathy, which are the major risk factors for DFU, as well as evidences of its role in wound healing and management of DFU. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that vitamin D influences multiple phases of wound healing and thereby accelerates the process. It modulates various cells involved in proliferation and remodelling phases. Vitamin D also enhances the expression of antimicrobial peptides that help to eliminate the microbes, as well as suppress the proinflammatory responses while enhancing the anti-inflammatory responses. This review concludes vitamin D to have a protective role in the immune and vascular system, improve glycaemic outcomes, and wound healing. Therefore, vitamin D could be a preferred adjuvant in the management of DFU.",Kurian SJ; Miraj SS; Benson R; Munisamy M; Saravu K; Rodrigues GS; Rao M,Current diabetes reviews,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33045979/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Manipulation of cellular metabolism could be beneficial to immunity and prevent metabolic and degenerative diseases including obesity, diabetes, and cancer. Maintenance of a normal metabolism depends on symbiotic consortium of gut microbes. Gut microbiota contributes to certain xenobiotic metabolisms and bioactive metabolites production. Gut microbiota-derived metabolites have been shown to be involved in inflammatory activation of macrophages and contribute to metabolic diseases. Recent studies have focused on how nutrients affect immunometabolism. Polyphenols, the secondary metabolites of plants, are presented in many foods and beverages. Several studies have demonstrated the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of polyphenols. Many clinical trials and epidemiological studies have also shown that long-term consumption of polyphenol-rich diet protects against chronic metabolic diseases. It is known that polyphenols can modulate the composition of core gut microbiota and interact with the immunometabolism. In the present article, we review the mechanisms of gut microbiota and its metabolites on immunometabolism, summarize recent findings on how the interaction between microbiota and polyphenol modulates host immunometabolism, and discuss future research directions.",Man AWC; Zhou Y; Xia N; Li H,Nutrients,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33036205/,1,0,0,0,0,0

However, both their biological relevance and potential properties make them an attractive group deserving increasing scientific interest. The use of efficient extraction and, in some cases, purification techniques can provide novel bioactives useful for food, nutraceutical, cosmeceutical and pharmaceutical applications. The bioactivity of marine phenolics is the consequence of their enzyme inhibitory effect and antimicrobial, antiviral, anticancer, antidiabetic, antioxidant, or anti-inflammatory activities. This review presents a survey of the major types of phenolic compounds found in marine sources, as well as their reputed effect in relation to the occurrence of dietary and lifestyle-related diseases, notably type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, metabolic syndrome, cancer and Alzheimer's disease.

Obesity has been related to disorders such as type-2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular diseases, among others, which has made of obesity the second cause of preventable death, only behind smoking. Bearing this in mind, it is necessary to find new strategies to overcome overweight/obesity and its associated pathologies. In this context, nutraceuticals and dietary supplements have become interesting tools thanks to their composition, rich in bioactive compounds beneficial to health. Among bioactive compounds, this study will focus on β-glucans, a type of soluble dietary fiber, and hydroxycinnamic acids, a group of phenols. Both types of compounds show complex and multifactorial effects, acting as hypolipemic, hypoglycemic, antioxidant, prebiotic and satiating agents. They act by modulating different metabolic pathways, affecting the absorption and metabolism of lipids and carbohydrates, reducing oxidative damage, promoting the proliferation of beneficial bacterial species, and reducing dietary intake.

32938758,"Relationships between hyperinsulinaemia, magnesium, vitamin D, thrombosis and COVID-19: rationale for clinical management.","Risk factors for COVID-19 patients with poorer outcomes include pre-existing conditions: obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease (CVD), heart failure, hypertension, low oxygen saturation capacity, cancer, elevated: ferritin, C reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer. A common denominator, hyperinsulinaemia, provides a plausible mechanism of action, underlying CVD, hypertension and strokes, all conditions typified with thrombi. The underlying science provides a theoretical management algorithm for the frontline practitioners.Vitamin D activation requires magnesium. Hyperinsulinaemia promotes: magnesium depletion via increased renal excretion, reduced intracellular levels, lowers vitamin D status via sequestration into adipocytes and hydroxylation activation inhibition. Hyperinsulinaemia mediates thrombi development via: fibrinolysis inhibition, anticoagulation production dysregulation, increasing reactive oxygen species, decreased antioxidant capacity via nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide depletion, haem oxidation and catabolism, producing carbon monoxide, increasing deep vein thrombosis risk and pulmonary emboli. Increased haem-synthesis demand upregulates carbon dioxide production, decreasing oxygen saturation capacity. Hyperinsulinaemia decreases cholesterol sulfurylation to cholesterol sulfate, as low vitamin D regulation due to magnesium depletion and/or vitamin D sequestration and/or diminished activation capacity decreases sulfotransferase enzyme SULT2B1b activity, consequently decreasing plasma membrane negative charge between red blood cells, platelets and endothelial cells, thus increasing agglutination and thrombosis.Patients with COVID-19 admitted with hyperglycaemia and/or hyperinsulinaemia should be placed on a restricted refined carbohydrate diet, with limited use of intravenous dextrose solutions. Degree/level of restriction is determined by serial testing of blood glucose, insulin and ketones. Supplemental magnesium, vitamin D and zinc should be administered. By implementing refined carbohydrate restriction, three primary risk factors, hyperinsulinaemia, hyperglycaemia and hypertension, that increase inflammation, coagulation and thrombosis risk are rapidly managed.",Cooper ID; Crofts CAP; DiNicolantonio JJ; Malhotra A; Elliott B; Kyriakidou Y; Brookler KH,Open heart,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32938758/,1,0,0,0,0,0

32890967,Propolis and its potential against SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms and COVID-19 disease: Running title: Propolis against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19.,"Propolis, a resinous material produced by honey bees from plant exudates, has long been used in traditional herbal medicine and is widely consumed as a health aid and immune system booster. The COVID-19 pandemic has renewed interest in propolis products worldwide; fortunately, various aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanism are potential targets for propolis compounds. SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is characterized by viral spike protein interaction with cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and serine protease TMPRSS2. This mechanism involves PAK1 overexpression, which is a kinase that mediates coronavirus-induced lung inflammation, fibrosis, and immune system suppression. Propolis components have inhibitory effects on the ACE2, TMPRSS2 and PAK1 signaling pathways; in addition, antiviral activity has been proven in vitro and in vivo. In pre-clinical studies, propolis promoted immunoregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including reduction in IL-6, IL-1 beta and TNF-α. This immunoregulation involves monocytes and macrophages, as well as Jak2/STAT3, NF-kB, and inflammasome pathways, reducing the risk of cytokine storm syndrome, a major mortality factor in advanced COVID-19 disease. Propolis has also shown promise as an aid in the treatment of various of the comorbidities that are particularly dangerous in COVID-19 patients, including respiratory diseases, hypertension, diabetes, and cancer. Standardized propolis products with consistent bioactive properties are now available. Given the current emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and limited therapeutic options, propolis is presented as a promising and relevant therapeutic option that is safe, easy to administrate orally and is readily available as a natural supplement and functional food.",Berretta AA; Silveira MAD; Cóndor Capcha JM; De Jong D,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32890967/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Despite promising data from animal studies in this scenario, the efficacy of taurine supplementation in human studies has been inconsistent. The main objective of this meta-analysis was to appraise the effects of taurine supplementation on liver markers and, secondarily, to explore anthropometric measures as well. Pubmed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched from inception to April 2020. There were 12 eligible peer-reviewed studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Most studies were conducted in patients with liver or metabolic dysregulation (diabetes, hepatitis, fatty liver, obesity, cystic fibrosis, chronic alcoholism, and cardiac surgery). The taurine dosage varied from 0.5 to 6 g/d for 15 days to 6 months. Pooled effect sizes suggested a significant effect of taurine administration on systolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference (WMD): -4.67 mm Hg; 95%CI, -9.10 to -0.25), diastolic blood pressure (WMD: -2.90 mm Hg; 95%CI, -4.29 to -1.52), total cholesterol (WMD: -10.87 mg/dl; 95%CI, -16.96 to -4.79), and triglycerides (WMD: -13.05 mg/dl; 95%CI, -25.88 to -0.22); however, it had no effect on fasting blood glucose (WMD: 0.06 mg/dl), HDL-C (WMD: 0.90 mg/dl), LDL-C (WMD: -6.17 mg/dl), as well as on body mass index (WMD: -0.46 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and body weight (WMD: -0.47 kg) as the anthropometric measures.

32860943,Butyrate generated by gut microbiota and its therapeutic role in metabolic syndrome.,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) and the associated incidence of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes represents a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality worldwide. Butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid produced by the gut microbiome, has long been known to promote growth in farmed animals and more recently has been reported to improve body weight and composition, lipid profile, insulin sensitivity and glycaemia in animal models of MetS. In vitro studies have examined the influence of butyrate on intestinal cells, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, hepatocytes, pancreatic islets and blood vessels, highlighting genes and pathways that may contribute to its beneficial effects. Butyrate's influences in these cells have been attributed primarily to its epigenetic effects as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, as well as its role as an agonist of free fatty acid receptors, but clear mechanistic evidence is lacking. There is also uncertainty whether results from animal studies can translate to human trials due to butyrate's poor systemic availability and rapid clearance. Hitherto, several small-scale human clinical trials have failed to show significant benefits in MetS patients. Further trials are clearly needed, including with formulations designed to improve butyrate's availability. Regardless, dietary intervention to increase the rate of butyrate production may be a beneficial addition to current treatment. This review outlines the current body of evidence on the suitability of butyrate supplementation for MetS, looking at mechanistic effects on the various components of MetS and highlighting gaps in the knowledge and roadblocks to its use in humans.",Bridgeman SC; Northrop W; Melton PE; Ellison GC; Newsholme P; Mamotte CDS,Pharmacological research,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32860943/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Recently, several trials have reported on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on diabetes prevention in people with prediabetes. A comprehensive literature review was performed using PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify: (1) recent meta-analyses of longitudinal observational studies that report on the association between blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) level and incident diabetes, and (2) clinical trials of adults with prediabetes that have reported on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on incident diabetes. Longitudinal observational studies report highly consistent associations between higher blood 25(OH)D levels and a lower risk of incident diabetes in diverse populations, including populations with prediabetes. Trials in persons with prediabetes show risk reduction in incident diabetes with vitamin D supplementation. In the 3 large trials that were specifically designed and conducted for the prevention of diabetes, vitamin D supplementation, when compared with placebo, reduced the risk of developing diabetes by 10% to 13% in persons with prediabetes not selected for vitamin D deficiency. Results from recent trials are congruent with a large body of evidence from observational studies indicating that vitamin D has a role in modulating diabetes risk. Participant-level meta-analysis of the 3 largest trials should provide a more refined estimate of risk reduction and identify patient populations that are likely to benefit the most from vitamin D supplementation.",Pittas AG; Jorde R; Kawahara T; Dawson-Hughes B,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32844212/,1,0,0,0,0,1

This body of evidence has not yet been quantitatively reviewed. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of DHA and EPA on several markers of systemic inflammation by pairwise and network meta-analyses of RCTs. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library were searched through to September 2019. We included RCTs of ≥7 d on adults regardless of health status that directly compared the effects of DHA with EPA and RCTs of indirect comparisons, in which the effects of DHA or EPA were compared individually to a control fatty acid. Differences in circulating concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and adiponectin were the primary outcome measures. Data were pooled by pairwise and network meta-analysis and expressed as mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs. Heterogeneity was assessed (Cochran Q statistic) and quantified (I2 statistic) in the pairwise meta-analysis. Inconsistency and transitivity were evaluated in the network meta-analysis. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Eligibility criteria were met by 5 RCTs (N = 411) for the pairwise meta-analysis and 20 RCTs (N = 1231) for the network meta-analysis. In the pairwise meta-analysis, DHA and EPA had similar effects on plasma CRP [MDDHA versus EPA = 0.14 mg/L (95% CI: -0.57, 0.85); I2 = 61%], IL-6 [MDDHA versus EPA = 0.10 pg/mL (-0.15, 0.34); I2 = 40%], and TNF-α [MDDHA versus EPA = -0.10 pg/mL (-0.37, 0.18); I2 = 40%].

This approval is based on the 25% CVD event risk reduction observed with IPE in the pre-specified primary composite endpoint (cardiovascular [CV] death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable angina) in the landmark Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial (REDUCE-IT). Notably, this reduction in CVD event risk with IPE was an incremental benefit to well-controlled low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; patients in REDUCE-IT had elevated triglyceride (TG) levels (135-499 mg/dL) and either had a history of atherosclerotic CVD or diabetes with additional CV risk factors. Given the CVD event risk reduction in REDUCE-IT, within a year following trial results, several global medical societies added IPE to their clinical guidelines. IPE is a stable, highly purified, FDA-approved prescription EPA ethyl ester. In contrast, mixed omega-3 products (docosahexaenoic acid + EPA combinations) have limited or no evidence for CVD event risk reduction, and nonprescription fish oil dietary supplements are not regulated as medicine by the FDA. We offer our perspective and rationale for why this evidence-based EPA-only formulation, IPE, should be added to the 'E' in the ABCDEF methodology for CV prevention. We provide multiple lines of evidence regarding an unmet need for CVD prevention beyond statin therapy, IPE clinical trials, IPE cost-effectiveness analyses, and proposed pleiotropic (non-lipid) mechanisms of action of EPA, as well as other relevant clinical considerations.

Here, we attempt to unravel the association of astaxanthin consumption with selected health benefits by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. Online literature search databases including Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed/Medline, Embase and Google Scholar were searched to discover relevant articles available up to 17 March 2020. We used mean changes and SD of the outcomes to assess treatment response from baseline and mean difference, and 95 % CI were calculated to combined data and assessment effect sizes in astaxanthin and control groups. 14 eligible articles were included in the final quantitative analysis. Current study revealed that astaxanthin consumption was not associated with FBS, HbA1c, TC, LDL-C, TG, BMI, BW, DBP, and SBP. We did observe an overall increase in HDL-C (WMD: 1.473 mg/dl, 95 % CI: 0.319-2.627, p = 0.012). As for the levels of CRP, only when astaxanthin was administered (i) for relatively long periods (≥ 12 weeks) (WMD: -0.528 mg/l, 95 % CI: -0.990 to -0.066), and (ii) at high dose (> 12 mg/day) (WMD: -0.389 mg/dl, 95 % CI: -0.596 to -0.183), the levels of CRP would decrease. In summary, our systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that astaxanthin consumption was associated with increase in HDL-C and decrease in CRP. Significant associations were not observed for other outcomes.",Xia W; Tang N; Kord-Varkaneh H; Low TY; Tan SC; Wu X; Zhu Y,Pharmacological research,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32755613/,0,1,0,1,0,0
32751906,Efficacy of Dietary Supplements to Reduce Liver Fat.,"Liver fat accumulation is an important pathophysiological feature of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease that may be modulated by dietary supplements (DS). A systematic search of the literature was conducted for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) pertaining to the effect of a DS on liver fat as assessed using quantitative tomographic imaging in human adults. Where feasible, data were pooled, and meta-analyses conducted using random-effect model. Quality assessment was done according the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias. Twenty RCTs, involving 1171 overweight and obese adults, of which 36% were females, with or without comorbidities, were included. Only RCTs assessing omega-3 fatty acids (<i>n</i> = 4) and resveratrol (<i>n</i> = 4) qualified for meta-analysis. Results did neither favor omega-3 (effect size -1.17; weighted mean difference (WMD) (95% confidence interval (CI)) -3.62, 1.28; <i>p</i> < 0.001) nor resveratrol supplementation (0.18; 95% CI -1.08, 1.43; <i>p</i> = 0.27). The findings of the qualitatively summarized RCTs suggested that catechins (<i>n</i> = 1), <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i> (<i>n</i> = 1), and carnitine (<i>n</i> = 1) may reduce liver fat. All other DS did not show any influence. The current evidence is scarce, of limited quality and does not support DS use to reduce liver fat. Further well-designed trials are warranted.",Kilchoer B; Vils A; Minder B; Muka T; Glisic M; Bally L,Nutrients,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32751906/,0,1,0,1,0,0
32738903,Myricetin bioactive effects: moving from preclinical evidence to potential clinical applications.,"Several flavonoids have been recognized as nutraceuticals, and myricetin is a good example. Myricetin is commonly found in plants and their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities is well demonstrated. One of its beneficial biological effects is the neuroprotective activity, showing preclinical activities on Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Huntington diseases, and even in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Also, myricetin has revealed other biological activities, among them as antidiabetic, anticancer, immunomodulatory, cardiovascular, analgesic and antihypertensive. However, few clinical trials have been performed using myricetin as nutraceutical. Thus, this review provides new insights on myricetin preclinical pharmacological activities, and role in selected clinical trials.",Taheri Y; Suleria HAR; Martins N; Sytar O; Beyatli A; Yeskaliyeva B; Seitimova G; Salehi B; Semwal P; Painuli S; Kumar A; Azzini E; Martorell M; Setzer WN; Maroyi A; Sharifi-Rad J,BMC complementary medicine and therapies,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32738903/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32735111,"Dietary Nitrate and Nitric Oxide Metabolism: Mouth, Circulation, Skeletal Muscle, and Exercise Performance.","Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous signaling molecule that plays an important role in myriad physiological processes, including the regulation of vascular tone, neurotransmission, mitochondrial respiration, and skeletal muscle contractile function. NO may be produced via the canonical NO synthase-catalyzed oxidation of l-arginine and also by the sequential reduction of nitrate to nitrite and then NO. The body's nitrate stores can be augmented by the ingestion of nitrate-rich foods (primarily green leafy vegetables). NO bioavailability is greatly enhanced by the activity of bacteria residing in the mouth, which reduce nitrate to nitrite, thereby increasing the concentration of circulating nitrite, which can be reduced further to NO in regions of low oxygen availability. Recent investigations have focused on promoting this nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway to positively affect indices of cardiovascular health and exercise tolerance. It has been reported that dietary nitrate supplementation with beetroot juice lowers blood pressure in hypertensive patients, and sodium nitrite supplementation improves vascular endothelial function and reduces the stiffening of large elastic arteries in older humans. Nitrate supplementation has also been shown to enhance skeletal muscle function and to improve exercise performance in some circumstances. Recently, it has been established that nitrate concentration in skeletal muscle is much higher than that in blood and that muscle nitrate stores are exquisitely sensitive to dietary nitrate supplementation and deprivation. In this review, we consider the possibility that nitrate represents an essential storage form of NO and discuss the integrated function of the oral microbiome, circulation, and skeletal muscle in nitrate-nitrite-NO metabolism, as well as the practical relevance for health and performance.",Jones AM; Vanhatalo A; Seals DR; Rossman MJ; Piknova B; Jonvik KL,Medicine and science in sports and exercise,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32735111/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32733487,Role of Immune Dysregulation in Increased Mortality Among a Specific Subset of COVID-19 Patients and Immune-Enhancement Strategies for Combatting Through Nutritional Supplements.,"<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic has been causing varying severities of illness. Some are asymptomatic and some develop severe disease leading to mortality across ages. This contrast triggered us explore the causes, with the background that a vaccine for effective immunization or a drug to tackle COVID-19 is not too close to reality. We have discussed strategies to combat COVID-19 through immune enhancement, using simple measures including nutritional supplements. <b>Discussion:</b> A literature search on mortality-related comorbid conditions was performed. For those conditions, we analyzed the pro-inflammatory cytokines, which could cause the draining of the immune reservoir. We also analyzed the immune markers necessary for the defense mechanism/immune surveillance against COVID-19, especially through simple means including immune enhancing nutritional supplement consumption, and we suggest strategies to combat COVID-19. Major comorbid conditions associated with increased mortality include cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, being immunocompromised by cancer, and severe kidney disease with a senile immune system. Consumption of <i>Aureobasidium pullulans</i> strain (AFO-202) beta 1,3-1,6 glucan supported enhanced IL-8, sFAS macrophage activity, and NK cells' cytotoxicity, which are major defense mechanisms against viral infection. <b>Conclusion:</b> People with co-morbid conditions who are more prone to COVID-19-related deaths due to immune dysregulation are likely to benefit from consuming nutritional supplements that enhance the immune system. We recommend clinical studies to validate AFO-202 beta glucan in COVID-19 patients to prove its efficacy in overcoming a hyper-inflammation status, thus reducing the mortality, until a definite vaccine is made available.",Rao KS; Suryaprakash V; Senthilkumar R; Preethy S; Katoh S; Ikewaki N; Abraham SJK,Frontiers in immunology,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32733487/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32730903,Effects of chromium supplementation on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"We aimed to investigate the effect of chromium supplementation on glycemic control indices in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Randomized controlled trials examining the effect of chromium supplementation on glycemic control indices and published before February 2020 were detected by searching online databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of sciences and The Cochrane Library, using a combination of suitable keywords. Mean change and standard deviation (SD) of the outcome measures were used to estimate the mean difference between the supplementation group and the control group at follow-up. Twenty-eight studies reported fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin, hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) as an outcome measure. Results revealed significant reduction in FPG (weighted mean difference (WMD): -19.00 mg/dl, 95% CI: -36.15, -1.85, P = 0.030; I<sup>2</sup>: 99.8%, p < 0.001), insulin level (WMD: -12.35 pmol/l, 95% CI: -17.86, -6.83, P < 0.001), HbA1C (WMD: -0.71 %, 95% CI: -1.19, -0.23, P = 0.004) and HOMA-IR (WMD: -1.53, 95% CI: -2.35, -0.72, P < 0.001; I<sup>2</sup>: 89.9%, p < 0.001) after chromium supplementation.

32730862,Vitamin D and pregnancy outcomes: Overall results of the FEPED study.,"Vitamin D insufficiency is highly prevalent in children and adults including pregnant women. During pregnancy, maternal vitamin D insufficiency could increase risks of several pregnancy complications and adverse birth outcomes. The FEPED study was designed to assess the effects of maternal vitamin D status in the first trimester during pregnancy on risks of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), preterm birth and small-for-gestational age (SGA) at birth. This observational prospective cohort included 3129 women with a singleton pregnancy between April 2012 and July 2014 in six maternity units in France and Belgium. The aim of this review is to summarize the results of the FEPED study. At the first trimester the mean 25(OH)D concentration was 21.9 ± 10.4 ng/mL and 25(OH)D concentration was <20 ng/mL in 46.5 % of patients. After matching 83 cases of preeclampsia with 319 controls, a significant decrease in the risk of preeclampsia was associated with maternal vitamin D levels ≥ 30 ng/mL in the third trimesters (OR = 0.34; 95 % CI: 0.13-0.86. P = 0.023). In the first trimester, the risk for preeclampsia was decreased in these patients, but did not achieve statistical significance (OR = 0.57 95 % CI, 0.30-1.01; p = 0.09). For the 250 cases with GDM matched with 941 controls, no linear relationship was found between GDM and 25OHD levels in the first trimester of pregnancy. Finally, 2813 pregnant women were included in analyses of risks of preterm and SGA birth. No association was found between low maternal vitamin D levels in the first trimester and the risks of preterm birth (aOR = 1.53; 95 % CI: 0.97-2.43) or SGA (aOR = 1.07; 95 % CI: 0.75-1.54).

32729431,Vitamin D as a Potential Therapeutic Option in Cancer Treatment: Is There a Role for Chemoprevention?,"Vitamin D (Vit D) serves as a precursor to the potent steroid hormone calcitriol, which regulates numerous genes that control homeostasis, epithelial cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Low level of Vit D is implicated in the development and progression of several diseases including bone fractures, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and cancers. The present review highlights the role of vitamin D in cancer with a particular emphasis on genetic variants related to Vit D metabolism as well as clinical trials of Vit D supplementation as a potential therapeutic option in the treatment of cancer patients. Data were collected following an electronic search in the Web of Science, Medline, PubMed, and Scopus databases by using some keywords such as ""cancer"", ""tumor"", ""malignancy"", ""vitamin D"", ""cholecalciferol"" and ""calcitriol"". The collected evidence from the studies revealed a consistent and strong association between Vit D status and cancer risk and survival. The associations between Vit D-related genetic variants and cancer survival support the hypothesis that Vit D may affect cancer outcomes. The mechanisms whereby Vit D reduces cancer risk and increases survival are regulation of cellular differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis as well as decreased angiogenesis in tumor microenvironment and inhibition of metastasis. There is a paucity of evidence-based recommendations for the optimal 25(OH)D levels in patients with cancer and the role of Vit D supplementation for primary or secondary prevention of cancer. Well-designed and sufficiently powered randomized clinical trials are necessary to assess the clinical application of Vit D in enhancing the clinical efficacy of standard and adjuvant chemotherapy regimens.",Bahrami A; Sahebkar A,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32729431/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32708036,The Importance of the Fatty Acid Transporter L-Carnitine in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD).,"L-carnitine transports fatty acids into the mitochondria for oxidation and also buffers excess acetyl-CoA away from the mitochondria. Thus, L-carnitine may play a key role in maintaining liver function, by its effect on lipid metabolism. The importance of L-carnitine in liver health is supported by the observation that patients with primary carnitine deficiency (PCD) can present with fatty liver disease, which could be due to low levels of intrahepatic and serum levels of L-carnitine. Furthermore, studies suggest that supplementation with L-carnitine may reduce liver fat and the liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) in patients with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). L-carnitine has also been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and elevate pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) flux. Studies that show reduced intrahepatic fat and reduced liver enzymes after L-carnitine supplementation suggest that L-carnitine might be a promising supplement to improve or delay the progression of NAFLD.",Savic D; Hodson L; Neubauer S; Pavlides M,Nutrients,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32708036/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32702899,Effectiveness of niacin supplementation for patients with type 2 diabetes: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Lipid profiles and glycemic control play a critical role in subsequent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of niacin supplementation on lipid profiles and glycemic control for patients with T2DM. The PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effects of niacin supplementation for patients with T2DM throughout December 2019. The weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were applied to calculate the pooled effect estimates using a random-effects model. Eight RCTs comprised a total of 2110 patients with T2DM who were selected for final quantitative analysis. The patients' niacin supplementation was associated with lower levels of total cholesterol (WMD, -0.28; 95% CI, -0.44 to -0.12; P = .001), triglyceride (WMD, -0.37; 95% CI, -0.52 to -0.21; P < .001), and low-density lipoprotein (WMD, -0.42; 95% CI, -0.50 to -0.34; P < .001). Moreover, the level of high-density lipoprotein was significantly increased when niacin supplementation (WMD, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.44; P < .001) was provided. However, niacin supplementation produced no significant effects on plasma glucose (WMD, 0.18; 95% CI, -0.14 to 0.50; P = .275) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels (WMD, 0.39; 95% CI, -0.15 to 0.94; P = .158). This study found that niacin supplementation could improve lipid profiles without affecting the glycemic levels for patients with T2DM. Additional large-scale RCTs should be conducted to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of niacin supplementation.",Xiang D; Zhang Q; Wang YT,Medicine,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32702899/,0,0,0,1,0,0
32679784,Immunologic Effects of Vitamin D on Human Health and Disease.,"Vitamin D is responsible for regulation of calcium and phosphate metabolism and maintaining a healthy mineralized skeleton. It is also known as an immunomodulatory hormone. Experimental studies have shown that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active form of vitamin D, exerts immunologic activities on multiple components of the innate and adaptive immune system as well as endothelial membrane stability. Association between low levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and increased risk of developing several immune-related diseases and disorders, including psoriasis, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis, sepsis, respiratory infection, and COVID-19, has been observed. Accordingly, a number of clinical trials aiming to determine the efficacy of administration of vitamin D and its metabolites for treatment of these diseases have been conducted with variable outcomes. Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that some individuals might benefit from vitamin D more or less than others as high inter-individual difference in broad gene expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to vitamin D supplementation has been observed. Although it is still debatable what level of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D is optimal, it is advisable to increase vitamin D intake and have sensible sunlight exposure to maintain serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at least 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L), and preferably at 40-60 ng/mL (100-150 nmol/L) to achieve the optimal overall health benefits of vitamin D.",Charoenngam N; Holick MF,Nutrients,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32679784/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32677037,Nutritional interventions for treating foot ulcers in people with diabetes.,"Foot ulcers in people with diabetes are non-healing, or poorly healing, partial, or full-thickness wounds below the ankle. These ulcers are common, expensive to manage and cause significant morbidity and mortality. The presence of a wound has an impact on nutritional status because of the metabolic cost of repairing tissue damage, in addition to the nutrient losses via wound fluid. Nutritional interventions may improve wound healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. To evaluate the effects of nutritional interventions on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. In March 2020 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta-analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effect of nutritional interventions on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. Two review authors, working independently, assessed included RCTs for their risk of bias and rated the certainty of evidence using GRADE methodology, using pre-determined inclusion and quality criteria. We identified nine RCTs (629 participants). Studies explored oral nutritional interventions as follows: a protein (20 g protein per 200 mL bottle), 1 kcal/mL ready-to-drink, nutritional supplement with added vitamins, minerals and trace elements; arginine, glutamine and β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate supplement; 220 mg zinc sulphate supplements; 250 mg magnesium oxide supplements; 1000 mg/day omega-3 fatty acid from flaxseed oil; 150,000 IU of vitamin D, versus 300,000 IU of vitamin D; 250 mg magnesium oxide plus 400 IU vitamin E and 50,000 IU vitamin D supplements. The comparator in eight studies was placebo, and in one study a different dose of vitamin D. Eight studies reported the primary outcome measure of ulcer healing; only two studies reported a measure of complete healing. Six further studies reported measures of change in ulcer dimension, these studies reported only individual parameters of ulcer dimensions (i.e. length, width and depth) and not change in ulcer volume. All of the evidence identified was very low certainty. We downgraded it for risks of bias, indirectness and imprecision. It is uncertain whether oral nutritional supplement with 20 g protein per 200 mL bottle, 1 kcal/mL, nutritional supplement with added vitamins, minerals and trace elements, increases the proportion of ulcers healed at six months more than placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 1.53). It is also uncertain whether arginine, glutamine and β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate supplement increases the proportion of ulcers healed at 16 weeks compared with placebo (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.40). It is uncertain whether the following interventions change parameters of ulcer dimensions over time when compared with placebo; 220 mg zinc sulphate supplement containing 50 mg elemental zinc, 250 mg magnesium oxide supplement, 1000 mg/day omega-3 fatty acid from flaxseed oil supplement, magnesium and vitamin E co-supplementation and vitamin D supplementation. It is also uncertain whether 150,000 IU of vitamin D, impacts ulcer dimensions when compared with 300,000 IU of vitamin D. Two studies explored some of the secondary outcomes of interest for this review. It is uncertain whether oral nutritional supplement with 20 g protein per 200 mL bottle, 1 kcal/mL, nutritional supplement with added vitamins, minerals and trace elements, reduces the number of deaths (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.06 to 14.60) or amputations (RR 4.82, 95% CI 0.24 to 95.88) more than placebo. It is uncertain whether arginine, glutamine and β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate supplement increases health-related quality of life at 16 weeks more than placebo (MD -0.03, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.03). It is also uncertain whether arginine, glutamine and β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate supplement reduces the numbers of new ulcers (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.51), or amputations (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.69) more than placebo. None of the included studies reported the secondary outcomes cost of intervention, acceptability of the intervention (or satisfaction) with respect to patient comfort, length of patient hospital stay, surgical interventions, or osteomyelitis incidence. One study exploring the impact of arginine, glutamine and β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate supplement versus placebo did not report on any relevant outcomes. Evidence for the impact of nutritional interventions on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes compared with no nutritional supplementation, or compared with a different dose of nutritional supplementation, remains uncertain, with eight studies showing no clear benefit or harm. It is also uncertain whether there is a difference in rates of adverse events, amputation rate, development of new foot ulcers, or quality of life, between nutritional interventions and placebo. More research is needed to clarify the impact of nutritional interventions on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes.",Moore ZE; Corcoran MA; Patton D,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32677037/,0,1,0,1,0,0

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the effect of garlic supplementation on inflammatory biomarkers. PubMed/Medline, Scopus and ISI web of science were searched up to February 2019. Random effects model was used to calculate the overall effects on C-reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and Tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF-α). 17 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the meta-analyses. Garlic supplementation significantly reduced the level of circulating CRP (P < 0.05), whereas it did not have any significant effect on IL-6 level (p > 0.05). Sub-group analysis showed that aged garlic extract (AGE) was able to reduce CRP and TNF-α significantly (P < 0.05). This meta-analysis showed that supplementation with garlic could reduce the level of circulating CRP and AGE could reduce the level of TNF-α and CRP, whereas it had no significant effect on the IL-6 level.",Mirzavandi F; Mollahosseini M; Salehi-Abargouei A; Makiabadi E; Mozaffari-Khosravi H,Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32673835/,0,1,0,1,0,0

Leaves, seeds and pods are the main parts used as food or food supplements. Nutritionally rich and with a high polyphenol content in the form of phenolic acids, flavonoids and glucosinolates, MO has been shown to exert numerous in vitro activities and in vivo effects, including hypoglycemic activity. A systematic search was carried out in the PubMed database and reference lists on the effects of MO on glucose metabolism. Thirty-three animal studies and eight human studies were included. Water and organic solvent extracts of leaves and, secondly, seeds, have been extensively assayed in animal models, showing the hypoglycemic effect, both under acute conditions and in long-term administrations and also prevention of other metabolic changes and complications associated to the hyperglycemic status. In humans, clinical trials are scarce, with variable designs and testing mainly dry leaf powder alone or mixed with other foods or MO aqueous preparations.

32659245,Use of Dietary Supplements in Living Kidney Donors: A Critical Review.,"Dietary supplement use is high among US adults, with the intention by users to promote overall health and wellness. Kidney donors, who are selected based on their overall good health and wellness, can have high utilization rates of dietary supplements. We provide a framework for the evaluation of living kidney donors and use of dietary supplements. In this review, dietary supplements will include any orally administered dietary or complementary nutritional products, but excluding micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), food, and cannabis. Use of dietary supplements can influence metabolic parameters that mask future risk for chronic illness such as diabetes and hypertension. Dietary supplements can also alter bleeding risk, anesthesia and analgesic efficacy, and safety in a perioperative period. Finally, postdonation monitoring of kidney function and risk for supplement-related nephrotoxicity should be part of a kidney donor educational process. For practitioners evaluating a potential kidney donor, we provide a list of the most commonly used herbal supplements and the effects on evaluation in a predonation, perioperative donation, and postoperative donation phase. Finally, we provide recommendations for best practices for integration into a comprehensive care plan for kidney donors during all stages of evaluation. We recommend avoidance of dietary supplements in a kidney donor population, although there is a paucity of data that identifies true harm. Rather, associations, known mechanisms of action, and common sense suggest that we avoid use in this population.",Leonberg-Yoo AK; Johnson D; Persun N; Bahrainwala J; Reese PP; Naji A; Trofe-Clark J,American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32659245/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32650482,Nutraceutical Compounds Targeting Inflammasomes in Human Diseases.,"The macromolecular complex known as ""inflammasome"" is defined as an intracellular multi-protein complex composed of a sensor receptor (PRR), an adaptor protein and an effector enzyme (caspase-1), which oligomerize when they sense danger, such as how the NLR family, AIM-2 and RIG-1 receptors protect the body against danger via cytokine secretion. Within the NLR members, NLRP3 is the most widely known and studied inflammasome and has been linked to many diseases. Nowadays, people's interest in their lifestyles and nutritional habits is increasing, mainly due to the large number of diseases that seem to be related to both. The term ""nutraceutical"" has recently emerged as a hybrid term between ""nutrition"" and ""pharmacological"" and it refers to a wide range of bioactive compounds contained in food with relevant effects on human health. The relationship between these compounds and diseases based on inflammatory processes has been widely exposed and the compounds stand out as an alternative to the pathological consequences that inflammatory processes may have, beyond their defense and repair action. Against this backdrop, here we review the results of studies using several nutraceutical compounds in common diseases associated with the inflammation and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasomes complex. In general, it was found that there is a wide range of nutraceuticals with effects through different molecular pathways that affect the activation of the inflammasome complex, with positive effects mainly in cardiovascular, neurological diseases, cancer and type 2 diabetes.",Castejón-Vega B; Giampieri F; Alvarez-Suarez JM,International journal of molecular sciences,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32650482/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Elevated total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels have a lead role in the development of coronary heart disease (CHD), while high levels of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) seem to have a protective role.The current treatment for dyslipidemia consists of lifestyle modification or drug therapy even if not pharmacological treatment should be always considered in addition to lipid-lowering medications.The use of lipid-lowering nutraceuticals alone or in association with drug therapy may be considered when the atherogenic cholesterol goal was not achieved.These substances can be classified according to their mechanisms of action into natural inhibitors of intestinal cholesterol absorption, inhibitors of hepatic cholesterol synthesis and enhancers of the excretion of LDL-C. Nevertheless, many of them are characterized by mixed or unclear mechanisms of action.The use of these nutraceuticals is suggested in individuals with borderline lipid profile levels or with drug intolerance, but cannot replace standard lipid-lowering treatment in patients at high, or very high CVD risk.Nutraceuticals can also have vascular effects, including improvement in endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness, as well as antioxidative properties. Moreover, epidemiological and clinical studies reported that in patients intolerant of statins, many nutraceuticals with demonstrated hypolipidemic effect are well tolerated.",Derosa G; Colletti A; Maffioli P; D'Angelo A; Lupi A; Zito GB; Mureddu GF; Raddino R; Fedele F; Cicero AFG,"Journal of cardiovascular medicine (Hagerstown, Md.)",2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32639326/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32599787,"Iron and Physical Activity: Bioavailability Enhancers, Properties of Black Pepper (Bioperine<sup>®</sup>) and Potential Applications.","Black pepper (<i>Piper nigrum</i> L.) has been employed in medicine (epilepsy, headaches, and diabetes), where its effects are mainly attributed to a nitrogen alkaloid called piperidine (1-(1-[1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl]-1-oxo-2,4 pentenyl) piperidine). Piperine co-administered with vitamins and minerals has improved its absorption. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the impact of the joint administration of iron (Fe) plus black pepper in physically active healthy individuals. Fe is a micronutrient that aids athletic performance by influencing the physiological functions involved in endurance sports by improving the transport, storage, and utilization of oxygen. Consequently, athletes have risk factors for Fe depletion, Fe deficiency, and eventually, anemia, mainly from mechanical hemolysis, gastrointestinal disturbances, and loss of Fe through excessive sweating. Declines in Fe stores have been reported to negatively alter physical capacities such as aerobic capacity, strength, and skeletal muscle recovery in elite athletes. Thus, there is a need to maintain Fe storage, even if Fe intake meets the recommended daily allowance (RDA), and Fe supplementation may be justified in physically active individuals, in states of Fe deficiency, with or without anemia. Females, in particular, should monitor their Fe hematological profile. The recommended oral Fe supplements are ferrous or ferric salts, sulfate, fumarate, and gluconate. These preparations constitute the first line of treatment; however, the high doses administered have gastrointestinal side effects that reduce tolerance and adherence to treatment. Thus, a strategy to counteract these adverse effects is to improve the bioavailability of Fe. Therefore, piperine may benefit the absorption of Fe through its bioavailability enhancement properties. Three research studies of Fe associated with black pepper have reported improvements in parameters related to the metabolism of Fe, without adverse effects. Although more research is needed, this could represent an advance in oral Fe supplementation for physically active individuals.",Fernández-Lázaro D; Mielgo-Ayuso J; Córdova Martínez A; Seco-Calvo J,Nutrients,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32599787/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32595258,PROOXIDANT ACTIVITIES OF ANTIOXIDANTS AND THEIR IMPACT ON HEALTH.,"This review article is focused on the impact of antioxidants and prooxidants on health with emphasis on the type of antioxidants that should be taken. Medical researchers suggest that diet may be the solution for the control of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular complications, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and different cancers. In this survey, we found scientific evidence that the use of antioxidants should be limited only to the cases where oxidative stress has been identified. This is often the case of specific population groups such as postmenopausal women, the elderly, infants, workers exposed to environmental pollutants, and the obese. Before starting any supplementation, it is necessary to measure oxidative stress and to identify and eliminate the possible sources of free radicals and thus increased oxidative stress.",Sotler R; Poljšak B; Dahmane R; Jukić T; Pavan Jukić D; Rotim C; Trebše P; Starc A,Acta clinica Croatica,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32595258/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32585000,Rheumatoid arthritis and dietary interventions: systematic review of clinical trials.,"The impact of various dietary interventions on rheumatoid arthritis (RA), characterized by immune-inflammatory response, has been subject to increased attention. A systematic review was conducted to update the current knowledge on the effects of nutritional, dietary supplement, and fasting interventions on RA outcomes. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, with prespecification of all methods, Medline and Embase were systematically searched for relevant articles. Data were extracted by 2 independent reviewers. A total of 70 human studies were identified. Administration of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids at high doses resulted in a reduction in RA disease activity and a lower failure rate of pharmacotherapy. Vitamin D supplementation and dietary sodium restriction were beneficial on some RA outcomes. Fasting resulted in significant but transient subjective improvements. While the Mediterranean diet demonstrated improvements in some RA disease activity measures, outcomes from vegetarian, elimination, peptide, or elemental diets suggested that responses are very individualized. Some dietary approaches may improve RA symptoms and thus it is recommended that nutrition should be routinely addressed.",Philippou E; Petersson SD; Rodomar C; Nikiphorou E,Nutrition reviews,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32585000/,0,1,0,0,0,0
32578904,Emerging use of senolytics and senomorphics against aging and chronic diseases.,"Senescence is a state of cell cycle arrest that plays an important role in embryogenesis, wound healing and protection against cancer. Senescent cells also accumulate during aging and contribute to the development of age-related disorders and chronic diseases, such as atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and liver disease. Molecules that induce apoptosis of senescent cells, such as dasatinib, quercetin, and fisetin, produce health benefits and extend lifespan in animal models. We describe here the mechanism of action of senolytics and senomorphics, many of which are derived from plants and fungi. We also discuss the possibility of using such compounds to delay aging and treat chronic diseases in humans.",Martel J; Ojcius DM; Wu CY; Peng HH; Voisin L; Perfettini JL; Ko YF; Young JD,Medicinal research reviews,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32578904/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32577225,Appropriate and inappropriate vitamin supplementation in children.,"The vitamin status of a child depends on many factors and most of the clinical studies do not take into account the different access to adequate nutrition of children coming from different countries and the consequent major differences in micronutrients or vitamin deficits between low-income and high-income countries. Vitamin supplements are included in the general field of dietary supplements. There is a large amount of not always factual material concerning vitamin supplements, and this may sometimes create confusion in clinicians and patients. Inadequate information may lead to the risk of attributing beneficial properties leading to their over-use or misuse in the paediatric field. Vitamin supplementation is indicated in all those conditions in which a vitamin deficiency is found, either because of a reduced intake due to reduced availability of certain foods, restrictive diets or inadequate absorption. The lack of guidelines in these fields may lead paediatricians to an improper use of vitamins, both in terms of excessive use or inadequate use. This is due to the fact that vitamin supplementation is often intended as a therapy of support rather than an essential therapeutic tool able to modify disease prognosis. In fact, various vitamins and their derivatives have therapeutic potential in the prevention and treatment of many diseases, especially in emerging conditions of paediatric age such as type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. The aim of the present article is to analyse the state of the art and consider new perspectives on the role of vitamin supplements in children.",Martini L; Pecoraro L; Salvottini C; Piacentini G; Atkinson R; Pietrobelli A,Journal of nutritional science,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32577225/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32531957,The Role of Vitamin D in the Development of Diabetes Post Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Literature Review.,"Women diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are more likely to later develop diabetes. Evidence from some previous reviews suggests that low vitamin D status during pregnancy increases the risk of developing GDM, but whether vitamin D during pregnancy also influences the risk of diabetes post GDM is less well studied. Thus, the aim of this systematic literature review was to summarize the current available literature on that topic. This review considered observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Five databases were searched. The risk of bias of the included studies was assessed. A total of six studies were included: three observational studies and three RCTs. Findings were inconsistent across the six included studies. However, when considering RCTs only, the findings more strongly suggested that vitamin D supplementation during and after pregnancy did not have an influence on markers of diabetes development or diabetes development post GDM. This systematic review highlights inconsistent findings on the associations between vitamin D supplementation or concentration during and after pregnancy and markers of diabetes development or diabetes development post GDM; and although results from randomized interventional studies more strongly suggested no associations, the conclusion holds a high degree of uncertainty.",Keller A; Varela Vazquez C; Dangol R; Damm P; Heitmann BL; Händel MN,Nutrients,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32531957/,0,1,0,0,0,0
32526091,Interventions to prevent women from developing gestational diabetes mellitus: an overview of Cochrane Reviews.,"The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing, with approximately 15% of pregnant women affected worldwide, varying by country, ethnicity and diagnostic thresholds. There are associated short- and long-term health risks for women and their babies. We aimed to summarise the evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews on the effects of interventions for preventing GDM. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (6 August 2019) with key words 'gestational diabetes' OR 'GDM' to identify reviews pre-specifying GDM as an outcome. We included reviews of interventions in women who were pregnant or planning a pregnancy, irrespective of their GDM risk status. Two overview authors independently assessed eligibility, extracted data and assessed quality of evidence using ROBIS and GRADE tools. We assigned interventions to categories with graphic icons to classify the effectiveness of interventions as: clear evidence of benefit or harm (GRADE moderate- or high-quality evidence with a confidence interval (CI) that did not cross the line of no effect); clear evidence of no effect or equivalence (GRADE moderate- or high-quality evidence with a narrow CI crossing the line of no effect); possible benefit or harm (low-quality evidence with a CI that did not cross the line of no effect or GRADE moderate- or high-quality evidence with a wide CI); or unknown benefit or harm (GRADE low-quality evidence with a wide CI or very low-quality evidence). We included 11 Cochrane Reviews (71 trials, 23,154 women) with data on GDM. Nine additional reviews pre-specified GDM as an outcome, but did not identify GDM data in included trials. Ten of the 11 reviews were judged to be at low risk of bias and one review at unclear risk of bias. Interventions assessed included diet, exercise, a combination of diet and exercise, dietary supplements, pharmaceuticals, and management of other health problems in pregnancy. The quality of evidence ranged from high to very low. Diet Unknown benefit or harm: there was unknown benefit or harm of dietary advice versus standard care, on the risk of GDM: risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.04; 5 trials; 1279 women; very low-quality evidence. There was unknown benefit or harm of a low glycaemic index diet versus a moderate-high glycaemic index diet on the risk of GDM: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.31; 4 trials; 912 women; low-quality evidence. Exercise Unknown benefit or harm: there was unknown benefit or harm for exercise interventions versus standard antenatal care on the risk of GDM: RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.84; 3 trials; 826 women; low-quality evidence. Diet and exercise combined Possible benefit: combined diet and exercise interventions during pregnancy versus standard care possibly reduced the risk of GDM: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.01; 19 trials; 6633 women; moderate-quality evidence. Dietary supplements Clear evidence of no effect: omega-3 fatty acid supplementation versus none in pregnancy had no effect on the risk of GDM: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.26; 12 trials; 5235 women; high-quality evidence. Possible benefit: myo-inositol supplementation during pregnancy versus control possibly reduced the risk of GDM: RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.64; 3 trials; 502 women; low-quality evidence. Possible benefit: vitamin D supplementation versus placebo or control in pregnancy possibly reduced the risk of GDM: RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; 4 trials; 446 women; low-quality evidence. Unknown benefit or harm: there was unknown benefit or harm of probiotic with dietary intervention versus placebo with dietary intervention (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.89; 1 trial; 114 women; very low-quality evidence), or probiotic with dietary intervention versus control (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.92; 1 trial; 111 women; very low-quality evidence) on the risk of GDM. There was unknown benefit or harm of vitamin D + calcium supplementation versus placebo (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.84; 1 trial; 54 women; very low-quality evidence) or vitamin D + calcium + other minerals versus calcium + other minerals (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.73; 1 trial; 1298 women; very low-quality evidence) on the risk of GDM. Pharmaceutical Possible benefit: metformin versus placebo given to obese pregnant women possibly reduced the risk of GDM: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.19; 3 trials; 892 women; moderate-quality evidence. Unknown benefit or harm:eight small trials with low- to very low-quality evidence showed unknown benefit or harm for heparin, aspirin, leukocyte immunisation or IgG given to women with a previous stillbirth on the risk of GDM. Management of other health issues Clear evidence of no effect: universal versus risk based screening of pregnant women for thyroid dysfunction had no effect on the risk of GDM: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.25; 1 trial; 4516 women; moderate-quality evidence. Unknown benefit or harm: there was unknown benefit or harm of using fractional exhaled nitrogen oxide versus a clinical algorithm to adjust asthma therapy on the risk of GDM: RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.77; 1 trial; 210 women; low-quality evidence. There was unknown benefit or harm of pharmacist led multidisciplinary approach to management of maternal asthma versus standard care on the risk of GDM: RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.25 to 99.82; 1 trial; 58 women; low-quality evidence. No interventions to prevent GDM in 11 systematic reviews were of clear benefit or harm. A combination of exercise and diet, supplementation with myo-inositol, supplementation with vitamin D and metformin were of possible benefit in reducing the risk of GDM, but further high-quality evidence is needed. Omega-3-fatty acid supplementation and universal screening for thyroid dysfunction did not alter the risk of GDM. There was insufficient high-quality evidence to establish the effect on the risk of GDM of diet or exercise alone, probiotics, vitamin D with calcium or other vitamins and minerals, interventions in pregnancy after a previous stillbirth, and different asthma management strategies in pregnancy. There is a lack of trials investigating the effect of interventions prior to or between pregnancies on risk of GDM.",Griffith RJ; Alsweiler J; Moore AE; Brown S; Middleton P; Shepherd E; Crowther CA,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32526091/,0,1,0,0,0,0
32507431,The effect of barberry (Berberis vulgaris L.) on glycemic indices: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of barberry (Berberis vulgaris L.) supplementation on glycemic indices in adults. A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and ISI Web of Science from inception up to January 2020, to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of barberry supplementation on glycemic markers including fasting blood sugar (FBS) concentrations, insulin levels, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) percentage. The results of this meta-analysis were reported, based on the random effects model. In total, 7 studies, comprising 452 participants, were included in the systematic review. The meta-analysis revealed that barberry significantly reduces insulin levels (Hedges's: -0.67; 95% CI: -1.31 to -0.03, P = 0.04, I<sup>2</sup> = 73.3%). However, no considerable changes was observed for FBS levels (WMD: -8.06 mg/dL; 95% CI: -20.46 to 4.33, P = 0.23, I<sup>2</sup> = 96.1%), HbA1c percentage (WMD: -0.83 %; 95% CI: -2.33 to 0.67, P = 0.27, I<sup>2</sup> = 88.3%), and HOMA-IR index (WMD: -0.55; 95% CI: -1.60 to 0.50, P = 0.30, I<sup>2</sup> = 99.4%). The present study suggests that although barberry supplementation significantly improves insulin levels; however, other glycemic indices might not be affected. However, more high-quality RCTs with longer duration are needed to further clarify the effects of barberry on blood glucose control, especially among patients with diabetes.",Safari Z; Farrokhzad A; Ghavami A; Fadel A; Hadi A; Rafiee S; Mokari-Yamchi A; Askari G,Complementary therapies in medicine,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32507431/,0,1,0,1,0,0
32491181,Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation on the Incidence of Diabetes Mellitus.,"The effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains controversial because most randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been small or have reported low doses of vitamin D. To conduct a meta-analysis of RCTs testing vitamin D supplementation in the prevention of T2DM. Database search of PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library was performed by 2 reviewers from inception through September 15, 2019. We included RCTs that reported the effect of vitamin D supplementation for at least 1 year on T2DM prevention. Two independent reviewers extracted the data. The risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. Primary outcome of the meta-analysis was the incidence of T2DM. Nine RCTs were included (43 559 participants). The mean age (standard deviation) was 63.5 (6.7) years. The RR for vitamin D compared with placebo was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.90-1.03); P = 0.30. In trials testing moderate to high doses of supplementation (≥1000 IU/day), all conducted among participants with prediabetes, the RR for vitamin D compared with placebo was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.79-0.99). In contrast, the trials testing lower doses, which were conducted in general population samples, showed no risk reduction (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.94-1.10; P, interaction by dose = 0.04). In patients with prediabetes, vitamin D supplementation at moderate to high doses (≥1000 IU/day), significantly reduced the incidence risk of T2DM, compared with placebo.",Barbarawi M; Zayed Y; Barbarawi O; Bala A; Alabdouh A; Gakhal I; Rizk F; Alkasasbeh M; Bachuwa G; Manson JE,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32491181/,0,0,0,1,0,0
32487800,Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy: an overview.,"Examine recent evidence of randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses regarding the effect of maternal vitamin D status and supplementation over obstetrical and offspring outcomes. Maternal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin [25(OH)D] progressively declines during pregnancy because of fetal physiological demands and adjustments. Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy in women with low vitamin D status may improve fetal growth and reduce the risks for small-for-gestational-age, preeclampsia, preterm birth, and gestational diabetes. Mothers with sufficient vitamin D levels have offsprings with less enamel defects and less attention deficit and hyperactive disorders and autism. All pregnant women should be supplemented with 600 IU/day of vitamin D3. We discuss evidence indicating that higher vitamin D doses (1000-4000 IU/day) may be convenient to achieve better maternal and infant outcomes. Low maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy may be associated in infants with a higher risk for lower bone mineral content, enamel defects and attention deficit hyperactive disorder. Recent evidence from vitamin D intervention studies and meta-analyses of a large number of studies support vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy to improve maternal, fetal and, immediate and later offspring health.",Pérez-López FR; Pilz S; Chedraui P,Current opinion in obstetrics & gynecology,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32487800/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32487384,Marine collagen and its derivatives: Versatile and sustainable bio-resources for healthcare.,"In the last two decades, marine collagen has attracted great scientific and industrial interest as a 'blue resource', with potential for use in various health-related sectors, such as food, medicine, pharmaceutics and cosmetics. In particular, the large availability of polluting by-products from the fish processing industry has been the key factor driving the research towards the conversion of these low cost by-products (e.g. fish skin and scales) into collagen-based products with high added value and low environmental impact. After addressing the extraction of collagen from aquatic sources and its physicochemical properties, this review focuses on the use of marine collagen and its derivatives (e.g. gelatin and peptides) in different healthcare sectors. Particular attention is given to the bioactive properties of marine collagen that are being explored in preclinical and clinical studies, and pave the way to an increased demand for this biomaterial in the next future. In this context, in addition to the use of native collagen for the development of tissue engineering or wound healing devices, particularly relevant is the use of gelatin and peptides for the development of dietary supplements and nutraceuticals, specifically directed to weight management and glycemic control. The marine collagen market is also briefly discussed to highlight the opportunities and the most profitable areas of interest.",Salvatore L; Gallo N; Natali ML; Campa L; Lunetti P; Madaghiele M; Blasi FS; Corallo A; Capobianco L; Sannino A,"Materials science & engineering.

32485837,Antidiabetic Effects of Flavan-3-ols and Their Microbial Metabolites.,"Diet is one of the pillars in the prevention and management of diabetes mellitus. Particularly, eating patterns characterized by a high consumption of foods such as fruits or vegetables and beverages such as coffee and tea could influence the development and progression of type 2 diabetes. Flavonoids, whose intake has been inversely associated with numerous negative health outcomes in the last few years, are a common constituent of these food items. Therefore, they could contribute to the observed positive effects of certain dietary habits in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Of all the different flavonoid subclasses, flavan-3-ols are consumed the most in the European region. However, a large proportion of the ingested flavan-3-ols is not absorbed. Therefore, the flavan-3-ols enter the large intestine where they become available to the colonic bacteria and are metabolized by the microbiota. For this reason, in addition to the parent compounds, the colonic metabolites of flavan-3-ols could take part in the prevention and management of diabetes. The aim of this review is to present the available literature on the effect of both the parent flavan-3-ol compounds found in different food sources as well as the specific microbial metabolites of diabetes in order to better understand their potential role in the prevention and treatment of the disease.",Márquez Campos E; Jakobs L; Simon MC,Nutrients,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32485837/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32468295,"[Selenium and zinc: ""antioxidants"" for healthy aging?].","Selenium and zinc are essential trace elements and an inadequate dietary intake has been implicated in the decline of immune and cognitive functions in aged persons and in the pathogenesis of age-related disorders. Both micronutrients are often marketed as ""antioxidants"" in mineral supplements; however, neither selenium nor zinc are antioxidants per se but they may exert beneficial effects as components of enzymes and other proteins that catalyze redox reactions and/or are involved in the maintenance of redox homeostasis. According to epidemiological data older individuals have an increased risk of developing deficiencies in the selenium and zinc status; however, such statistical correlations in epidemiological studies do not imply a causal association. Intervention trials are scarce and have yielded inconsistent and sometimes even adverse results. It should also be noted that the observed deficiencies in micronutrients may not necessarily be attributable to inadequate dietary intake as the absorption and distribution within the body might also be influenced by factors such as medications or interaction with other food ingredients. Thus, any dietary supplementation should be implemented with caution and persons who wish to take mineral supplements should first seek medical advice.

32468224,The Effects of Magnesium Supplementation on Lipid Profile Among Type 2 Diabetes Patients: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the effects of magnesium (Mg) supplementation on the lipid profile in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients. Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and Embase databases were searched to infinity until 30 January 2020. Weighted mean differences (WMD) were pooled using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis, and publication bias were reported using standard methods. The pooled analysis of 12 randomized controlled trial s indicated that Mg administration led to significant reduction of serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels (p = 0.006). However, our results revealed that Mg supplementation did not have any effect on triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) serum concentrations among T2DM patients in comparison with the control group. Subgroup analysis based on duration of study suggested that more than 12 weeks of Mg supplementation significantly decreased the serum TC levels (p = 0.002). Subgroup analysis comparing the dose of intervention indicated that Mg supplementation less than 300 mg significantly decreased the serum LDL concentrations (p < 0.001), while more than 300 mg of Mg supplementation significantly increased the serum HDL levels (p = 0.026). In a subgroup analysis comparing the type of intervention, it displayed that inorganic Mg supplementation decreased the LDL (p < 0.001) and TC (p = 0.003) levels, while organic Mg supplementation showed no difference. Mg supplementation has a beneficial effect on lowering LDL level in T2DM patients. However, we have to note that any research performed so far is not sufficient for making robust guidelines to use Mg supplementation in clinical practice.",Asbaghi O; Moradi S; Nezamoleslami S; Moosavian SP; Hojjati Kermani MA; Lazaridi AV; Miraghajani M,Biological trace element research,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32468224/,0,1,0,1,0,0
32451277,Effects of zinc supplementation on lipid profile in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Findings on the effects of zinc supplementation on the lipid profile in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are conflicting. The current comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to summarize available evidence in this regard. After a systematic search in the online databases, we included the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of zinc supplementation on lipid profile [total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG)] in patients with T2DM. Altogether, 9 studies with a total sample size of 424 patients with T2DM were included in the analysis. Combining 9 effect sizes from 9 RCTs, we found a significant lowering effect of zinc supplementation on serum levels of TG (weighted mean difference (WMD): -17.08, 95% CI: -30.59, -3.58 mg/dL, P = 0.01) and TC (WMD: -26.16, 95% CI: -49.69, -2.62 mg/dL, P = 0.02). Although the overall effect of zinc supplementation on LDL-C levels was not significant, a beneficial effect was seen in studies that administered <100 mg/d zinc. Based on the non-linear dose-response analysis, a greater reduction in serum levels of TC and LDL-C following zinc supplementation was seen at <12 weeks' duration of intervention. Unlike the overall effect size, we found a significant increasing effect of zinc supplementation on serum HDL-C concentrations in most subgroups of RCTs according to the subgroup analyses.

32445957,Clinical approach to the inflammatory etiology of cardiovascular diseases.,"Inflammation is an obligatory marker of arterial disease, both stemming from the inflammatory activity of cholesterol itself and from well-established molecular mechanisms. Raised progenitor cell recruitment after major events and clonal hematopoiesis related mechanisms have provided an improved understanding of factors regulating inflammatory phenomena. Trials with inflammation antagonists have led to an extensive evaluation of biomarkers such as the high sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP), not exerting a causative role, but frequently indicative of the individual cardiovascular (CV) risk. Aim of this review is to provide indication on the anti-inflammatory profile of agents of general use in CV prevention, i.e. affecting lipids, blood pressure, diabetes as well nutraceuticals such as n-3 fatty acids. A crucial issue in the evaluation of the benefit of the anti-inflammatory activity is the frequent discordance between a beneficial activity on a major risk factor and associated changes of hsCRP, as in the case of statins vs PCSK9 antagonists. In hypertension, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors exert an optimal anti-inflammatory activity, vs the case of sartans. The remarkable preventive activity of SLGT-2 inhibitors in heart failure is not associated with a clear anti-inflammatory mechanism. Finally, icosapent ethyl has been shown to reduce the CV risk in hypertriglyceridemia, with a 27 % reduction of hsCRP.

Plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) are currently being considered as a critical risk factor for the diseases mentioned above, especially atherosclerosis. Because of the heterogeneous nature of LDL, many studies have already been conducted on its subclasses, especially small dense LDL (sdLDL). According to available evidence, sdLDL levels can be considered as an ideal alternative to LDL levels for monitoring CVD and early diagnosis of atherosclerosis. Recently, several researchers have focused on factors that are able to decrease sdLDL levels and improve health quality. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to describe the production process of sdLDL particles and review the effects of pharmaceutical and dietary agents as well as lifestyle on sdLDL plasma levels. In brief, their mechanisms of action are discussed. Apparently, cholesterol and LDL-lowering compounds are also effective in the reduction of sdLDL levels. In addition, improving lipid profile, especially the reduction of triglyceride levels, appropriate regimen, and lifestyle can decrease sdLDL levels. Therefore, all the aforementioned parameters should be taken into consideration simultaneously in sdLDL levels reducing strategies.",Alizadeh-Fanalou S; Nazarizadeh A; Alian F; Faraji P; Sorori B; Khosravi M,Biological chemistry,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32427116/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The literature search was performed with two databases, namely Medline/PubMed and Web of Science, until 20 May 2019 for both observational and experimental studies concerning relationships between vitamin D and polycystic ovary syndrome. A total of ten studies with randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled trial design from 2008 to 2019 were selected for this review. The inclusion criteria were women 18-45 years of age with polycystic ovary syndrome and comparing the metabolic or endocrine parameters between placebo and vitamin D supplementation groups. A total of ten studies were selected for this review. We found that vitamin D supplementation had a significant effect on insulin metabolism, total serum testosterone, hirsutism, C-reactive protein, and total antioxidant capacity in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Evidence from available randomized controlled trials suggests that patients with polycystic ovary syndrome should take vitamin D supplementation for the beneficial effect of metabolic profiles.

NAFLD is a chronic disease and results from a combination of genetic, environmental and predominantly lifestyle-related causes. Therefore, NAFLD, similarly to cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and many different types of cancer, can be considered a noncommunicable disease. Consequently, lifestyle intervention, particularly if associated with a large amount of weight loss, is considered highly effective and safe to treat NAFLD. For patients with advanced-stage NAFLD or that cannot lose weight, metabolically-based pharmacotherapy is effective to improve liver histology and cardiometabolic risk profile.

32405356,Flavonoid-rich foods (FRF): A promising nutraceutical approach against lifespan-shortening diseases.,"It is well documented that life expectancy in developed countries at birth is going to surpass the 20<sup>th</sup> century. However, regrettably, a potential decline in life expectancy has been proposed for these nations in the 21st century due to a rapid upsurge in the prevalence of fatal degenerative diseases like cardiovascular diseases (CVD), cancer and diabetes. Collectively, these three diseases accounted for 65% of all deaths in urbanized societies and were considered as a dynamic issue for shortening the genetically determined lifespan through increased mortalities, morbidities, disabilities, immense sufferings, and premature aging. These fatal degenerative diseases and premature aging are closely associated with oxidative stress produced by the free radicals in the body. In epidemiologic studies, flavonoid-rich foods (FRF) like fruits, vegetables, and beverages have been associated as protective agents against these diseases. These also have been observed for their geroprotective effects and help in preventing premature aging and deterioration of brain function, which is related to Alzheimer's disease and dementia. In this review, we presented a comprehensive overview of the FRF for their potential role against lifespan-shortening complications, i.e., CVD, cancer, and diabetes. We also have drawn the future perspective and dietary guidelines to reduce the fatal disease burden in urban populations.",Waheed Janabi AH; Kamboh AA; Saeed M; Xiaoyu L; BiBi J; Majeed F; Naveed M; Mughal MJ; Korejo NA; Kamboh R; Alagawany M; Lv H,Iranian journal of basic medical sciences,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32405356/,1,0,0,0,0,0

32397145,Polyphenols as Caloric-Restriction Mimetics and Autophagy Inducers in Aging Research.,"It has been thought that caloric restriction favors longevity and healthy aging where autophagy plays a vital role. However, autophagy decreases during aging and that can lead to the development of aging-associated diseases such as cancer, diabetes, neurodegeneration, etc. It was shown that autophagy can be induced by mechanical or chemical stress. In this regard, various pharmacological compounds were proposed, including natural polyphenols. Apart from the ability to induce autophagy, polyphenols, such as resveratrol, are capable of modulating the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors, neutralizing free radical species, affecting mitochondrial functions, chelating redox-active transition metal ions, and preventing protein aggregation. Moreover, polyphenols have advantages compared to chemical inducers of autophagy due to their intrinsic natural bio-compatibility and safety. In this context, polyphenols can be considered as a potential therapeutic tool for healthy aging either as a part of a diet or as separate compounds (supplements). This review discusses the epigenetic aspect and the underlying molecular mechanism of polyphenols as an anti-aging remedy. In addition, the recent advances of studies on NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) regulation of autophagy, the role of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in cells senescence and their regulation by polyphenols have been highlighted as well. Apart from that, the review also revised the latest information on how polyphenols can help to improve mitochondrial function and modulate apoptosis (programmed cell death).",Yessenkyzy A; Saliev T; Zhanaliyeva M; Masoud AR; Umbayev B; Sergazy S; Krivykh E; Gulyayev A; Nurgozhin T,Nutrients,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32397145/,1,0,0,0,0,0

32385715,The Effects of Magnesium Supplementation on Blood Pressure and Obesity Measure Among Type 2 Diabetes Patient: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"In this study, we aimed to systematically review the literature to evaluate the effects of magnesium (Mg) supplementation on blood pressure (BP) and obesity measure among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Major electronic databases of Web of Science, the Cochrane library, PubMed, and Scopus were searched completely from the inception until 15 October 2019 to identify randomized clinical trials (RCTs) pertaining to the topic of interest. All outcomes were pooled using a random-effects model and expressed as weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidential intervals (CI). Heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis, and publication bias were also assessed using standard methods. The pooled analysis of five RCTs showed that Mg supplementation did not affect body weight (WMD: - 0.01 kg, 95% CI: - 0.36 to 0.33), BMI (WMD: - 0.07, 95% CI: - 0.18 to 0.04), and waist circumference (WMD: 0.12, 95% CI: - 1.24 to 1.48) in T2DM patients compared to the control groups of the patients who received placebo. However, pooling seven RCTs together showed significant reduction of systolic blood pressure (WMD: - 5.78 mmHg, 95% CI: - 11.37 to - 0.19) and diastolic blood pressure (WMD: - 2.50 mmHg, 95% CI: - 4.58 to - 0.41) in T2DM patients. Furthermore, subgroup analysis by dose of intervention, intervention duration, and type of intervention suggested that Mg supplementation for > 12 weeks, in doses higher than 300 mg/day or inorganic forms, could significantly decrease both systolic and diastolic BP in T2DM patients. Based on the findings, Mg supplementation has beneficial effects on BP in type 2 diabetes patients independent of body weight status.

32384902,Effects of fish oil supplementation on glucose control and lipid levels among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Previous studies have yielded inconsistent findings on the role of fish oil in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We systematically summarized the available evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCT) and aimed to investigate the effects of fish oil supplementation on glucose control and lipid levels among patients with T2DM. A comprehensive literature search was performed in electronic databases (PubMed, ProQuest, Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang) to identify all relevant RCTs which were published up to May 31st, 2019. We used Modified Jadad Score system to evaluate the quality of each included RCT. The pooled effects were estimated using random-effects model and presented as standardized mean differences with 95% confidence intervals. A total of 12 RCTs were included in this meta-analysis. There was no significant difference in glucose control outcomes comparing fish oil supplementation to placebo. The effect size of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was 0.13 (95% CI: - 0.03 to 0.28, p > 0.05). No marked change was observed in fasting insulin (FINS), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and HOMA of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) levels. Fish oil supplementation was associated with a decrease of triglyceride (TG) level by - 0.40 (95%CI: - 0.53 to - 0.28, p < 0.05), and an increase of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level by 0.21 (95%CI: 0.05 to 0.37, p < 0.05). In subgroup analysis, HDL cholesterol level was higher among Asian and low-dose(< 2 g/d n-3 PUFA) subgroups compared to their counterparts (p < 0.05). TG level was lower in mid and long duration groups, along with an inconspicuous difference in short duration group. This meta-analysis shows that among patients with T2DM, fish oil supplementation leads to a favorable blood lipids profile but does not improve glucose control.",Gao C; Liu Y; Gan Y; Bao W; Peng X; Xing Q; Gao H; Lai J; Liu L; Wang Z; Yang Y,Lipids in health and disease,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32384902/,0,0,0,1,0,0
32377517,Antidiabetic Potential of Marine Brown Algae-a Mini Review.,"Marine algae are an important source of bioactive metabolites in drug development and nutraceuticals. Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder and the third leading cause of death worldwide due to lifestyle changes associated with rapid urbanization. Due to the adverse side effects of currently available antidiabetic drugs, search for an effective natural-based antidiabetic drug is important to combat diabetes and its complications. Therefore, in lieu with herbal drug development, it is important to find the potential benefits of seaweeds for the management of type 2 diabetes as they are underexplored yet in Sri Lanka. Among the marine seaweeds, natural bioactive compounds are abundant in brown algae with potentials in application as active ingredients in drug leads and nutraceuticals. Bioactive secondary metabolites are derived from numerous biosynthetic pathways of marine algae which contribute to various chemical and biological properties. Phlorotannins present in marine brown algae exhibited antidiabetic activities through different mechanisms such as the inhibitory effect of enzyme targets mainly by inhibiting the enzymes such as <i>α</i>-amylase, <i>α</i>-glucosidase, angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE), aldose reductase, dipeptidyl peptidase-4, and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP 1B) enzyme. In addition, phlorotannins derived from brown algae have the ability to reduce diabetic complications. Hence, the present review focuses on the different antidiabetic mechanisms of secondary bioactive compounds present in marine brown algae.",Gunathilaka TL; Samarakoon K; Ranasinghe P; Peiris LDC,Journal of diabetes research,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32377517/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Leucine, a branched amino acid, has anti-obesity effects on glucose tolerance, lipid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity. Leucine also modulates mitochondrial dysfunction, representing a new strategy to target aging, neurodegenerative disease, obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Although various studies have been carried out, much uncertainty still exists and further studies are required to fully elucidate the relationship between leucine and lipid metabolism. This review offers an up-to-date report on leucine, as key roles in both lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis in vivo and in vitro by acceleration of fatty acid oxidation, lipolysis, activation of the adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-silent information regulator of transcription 1 (SIRT1)-proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) pathway, synthesis, and/or secretion of adipokines and stability of the gut microbiota.",Zhang L; Li F; Guo Q; Duan Y; Wang W; Zhong Y; Yang Y; Yin Y,Nutrients,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32370170/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32370073,Valorisation of By-Products from Soybean (<i>Glycine max</i> (L.) Merr.) Processing.,"In recent years, increased awareness of the health benefits associated with consuming soy-based foods, knowledge of milk-related allergies and a move towards more sustainable food production have led to an increase in the number of available soy-based products. The biggest producers in the world, the USA, South America and China, are from the Pacific region. This enormous production is accompanied by the accumulation of related by-products, in particular, a substance that is known as okara. Okara is a paste that is rich in fibre (50%), protein (25%), fat (10%), vitamins and trace elements. Its proper use would lead to economic advantages and a reduction in the potential for polluting the environment. Its high fibre content and low production costs mean that it could also be used as a dietary supplement to prevent diabetes, obesity and hyperlipidaemia. Chemical or enzymatic treatment, fermentation, extrusion, high pressure and micronisation can all increase the soluble fibre content, and thus improve nutritional quality and processing properties. However, the product also degrades rapidly due to its high moisture content (70-80%), which makes it difficult to handle and expensive to dry by conventional means. The aim of this paper is therefore to thoroughly study the existing literature on this subject in order to develop a general protocol for okara exploitation and valorisation. A cost/benefit analysis could drive the design of eco-friendly, sustainable protocols for the preparation of high-value nutritional products.",Colletti A; Attrovio A; Boffa L; Mantegna S; Cravotto G,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32370073/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32341338,Use and abuse of dietary supplements in persons with diabetes.,"The dietary supplement industry has estimated sales of over $30 billion in the US and over $100 billion globally. Many consumers believe that dietary supplements are safer and possibly more effective than drugs to treat diabetes. The sheer volume of the literature in this space makes compiling them into one review challenging, so much so that primarily narrative reviews currently exist. By applying the interactive database supplied by the Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health, we identified the top 100 ingredients that appeared most often in dietary supplement products. One-hundred different keyword searches using the ingredient name and the word diabetes were performed using a program developed to automatically scrape PubMed. Each search was retained in a separate Excel spreadsheet, which was then reviewed for inclusion or exclusion. The studies that met the inclusion criteria were evaluated for effect of reducing and controlling diabetes. The PubMed scrape resulted in 6217 studies. For each keyword search only the most recent 100 were retained, which refined the total to 1823 studies. Of these 425 met the screening criteria. The ingredients, fiber, selenium and zinc had the most studies associated with improvement in diabetes. Several popular supplement ingredients (phosphorus, pantothenic acid, calcium, magnesium, glutamine, isoleucine, tyrosine, choline, and creatine monohydrate) did not result in any studies meeting our screening criteria. Our study demonstrates how to automate reviews to filter and collapse literature in content areas that have an enormous volume of studies. The aggregated set of studies suggest there is little clinical evidence for the use of dietary supplements to reduce or control diabetes.",Hannon BA; Fairfield WD; Adams B; Kyle T; Crow M; Thomas DM,Nutrition & diabetes,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32341338/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32338202,Regulation of Apolipoprotein B by Natural Products and Nutraceuticals: A Comprehensive Review.,"Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is the most important and the number one cause of mortality in both developing and industrialized nations. The co-morbidities associated with CVD are observed from infancy to old age. Apolipoprotein B100 (Apo B) is the primary apolipoprotein and structural protein of all major atherogenic particles derived from the liver including Very-Low- Density Lipoproteins (VLDL), Intermediate-density Lipoprotein (IDL), and Low-density Lipoprotein (LDL) particles. It has been suggested that measurement of the Apo B concentration is a superior and more reliable index for the prediction of CVD risk than is the measurement of LDL-C. Nutraceuticals and medicinal plants have attracted significant attention as it pertains to the treatment of non-communicable diseases, particularly CVD, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). The effect of nutraceuticals and herbal products on CVD, as well as some of its risk factors such as dyslipidemia, have been investigated previously. However, to the best of our knowledge, the effect of these natural products, including herbal supplements and functional foods (e.g. fruits and vegetables as either dry materials, or their extracts) on Apo B has not yet been investigated. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper was to review the effect of bioactive natural compounds on plasma Apo B concentrations. It is concluded that, in general, medicinal plants and nutraceuticals can be used as complementary medicine to reduce plasma Apo B levels in a safe, accessible, and inexpensive manner in an attempt to prevent and treat CVD.",Bagherniya M; Johnston TP; Sahebkar A,Current medicinal chemistry,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32338202/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The aim of our study is to investigate the role of probiotics support therapy in blood pressure and, as a kind of convenient and economic drugs for prevention and auxiliary treatment of hypertension. We performed a systemic review and meta-analysis to examine the effect of probiotics consumption on blood pressure. Databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Clinical trials, CNKI and the Cochrane library were searched. Also, the grey literature and references were searched. Twenty-three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 2037 participants met the inclusion criteria and were included. Probiotic consumption significantly changed systolic blood pressure (SBP) by - 3.05 mmHg (95%CI: - 4.67, - 1.44; P < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by - 1.51 mmHg (95%CI: - 2.38, - 0.65; P = 0.001). Subgroup analysis indicated that the benefit effect of probiotics supplementation in SBP was only observed in hypertension [weight mean difference (WMD) = - 3.31 mmHg, 95%CI: - 5.71, - 0.92; P = 0.007] or type 2 diabetes (WMD = -4.85 mmHg, 95%CI: - 9.28, - 0.42; P = 0.032) patients, and the decreased DBP level by probiotics supplementation was only observed in hypertension patients (WMD = -2.02 mmHg, 95%CI: - 3.68, - 0.36; P = 0.017).This effect could only last for a short-term time of 8 or 10 weeks, but not for a long-term time. This meta-analysis found a moderate and statistically significant reduction for either SBP or DBP with probiotics supplement compared with controls.

Studies were considered eligible if they were controlled trials in humans, measuring immunological parameters, on viral and respiratory infections. Clinical trials on vitamins, minerals, nutraceuticals and probiotics were included. A total of 640 records were identified initially and 22 studies were included from other sources. After excluding duplicates and articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria, 43 studies were obtained (vitamins: 13; minerals: 8; nutraceuticals: 18 and probiotics: 4). Among vitamins, A and D showed a potential benefit, especially in deficient populations. Among trace elements, selenium and zinc have also shown favourable immune-modulatory effects in viral respiratory infections. Several nutraceuticals and probiotics may also have some role in enhancing immune functions. Micronutrients may be beneficial in nutritionally depleted elderly population. We summaries possible benefits of some vitamins, trace elements, nutraceuticals and probiotics in viral infections. Nutrition principles based on these data could be useful in possible prevention and management of COVID-19.",Jayawardena R; Sooriyaarachchi P; Chourdakis M; Jeewandara C; Ranasinghe P,Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32334392/,0,1,0,0,0,0
32329358,Benefits of micronutrient supplementation for reducing the risk of wet age-related macular disease and diabetic retinopathy: An update.,"Age-related macular disease and diabetic retinopathy are chronic degenerative diseases characterised by progressive visual impairment. In Europe, age-related macular disease accounts for over 15% of blindness in adults over 50 years of age, and although the burden of diabetic retinopathy in terms of vision impairment is lower, vision loss associated with diabetic retinopathy is increasing with the rising prevalence of diabetes mellitus and the ageing of the population. Late-stage age-related macular disease can be subdivided into dry (non-neovascular) or wet (neovascular or exudative) forms. The large Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 showed that supplementation with antioxidant nutrients reduces choroids neovascularisation and reduces the risk of progression of neovascular age-related macular disease. Antioxidant micronutrient supplements have also shown promising results in preventing the pathogenesis of retinopathy in animal models of diabetes. Age-related macular disease and diabetic retinopathy are understood to share some common pathophysiological characteristics, suggesting that micronutrients have an important role in ocular health in both conditions. This article will review the current evidence for the utility of micronutrients in preventing the development and progression of neovascular age-related macular disease and diabetic retinopathy.",Battaglia Parodi M; Brunoro A; Tomasso L; Scuderi G,European journal of ophthalmology,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32329358/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32316418,Effects of Acute Dietary Polyphenols and Post-Meal Physical Activity on Postprandial Metabolism in Adults with Features of the Metabolic Syndrome.,"Approximately 22% of U.S. adults and 25% of adults globally have metabolic syndrome (MetS). Key features, such as dysglycemia and dyslipidemia, predict type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, premature disability, and death. Acute supplementation of dietary polyphenols and post-meal physical activity hold promise in improving postprandial dysmetabolism. To our knowledge, no published review has described the effects of either intervention on postprandial glucose, insulin, lipids, and markers of oxidative damage and inflammation in adults with features of MetS. Thus, we conducted this review of controlled clinical trials that provided dietary polyphenols from oils, fruits, teas, and legumes during a dietary challenge, or implemented walking, cycling, and stair climbing and descending after a dietary challenge. Clinical trials were identified using ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed, and Google Scholar and were published between 2000 and 2019. Dietary polyphenols from extra virgin olive oil, grapes, blackcurrants, strawberries, black tea, and black beans improved postprandial glucose, insulin, and markers of oxidative damage and inflammation, but results were not consistent among clinical trials. Freeze-dried strawberry powder distinctly improved postprandial insulin and markers of oxidative damage and inflammation. Post-meal physical activity attenuated postprandial glucose, but effects on postprandial lipids and markers of oxidative damage and inflammation were inconclusive. Consuming dietary polyphenols with a meal and completing physical activity after a meal may mitigate postprandial dysmetabolism in adults with features of MetS.",Davis DW; Navalta JW; McGinnis GR; Serafica R; Izuora K; Basu A,Nutrients,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32316418/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32315653,Nutraceutical characteristics of the brown seaweed carotenoid fucoxanthin.,"Fucoxanthin (Fx), a major carotenoid found in brown seaweed, is known to show a unique and wide variety of biological activities. Upon absorption, Fx is metabolized to fucoxanthinol and amarouciaxanthin, and these metabolites mainly accumulate in visceral white adipose tissue (WAT). As seen in other carotenoids, Fx can quench singlet oxygen and scavenge a wide range of free radicals. The antioxidant activity is related to the neuroprotective, photoprotective, and hepatoprotective effects of Fx. Fx is also reported to show anti-cancer activity through the regulation of several biomolecules and signaling pathways that are involved in either cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, or metastasis suppression. Among the biological activities of Fx, anti-obesity is the most well-studied and most promising effect. This effect is primarily based on the upregulation of thermogenesis by uncoupling protein 1 expression and the increase in the metabolic rate induced by mitochondrial activation. In addition, Fx shows anti-diabetic effects by improving insulin resistance and promoting glucose utilization in skeletal muscle.",Miyashita K; Beppu F; Hosokawa M; Liu X; Wang S,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32315653/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32307880,Adulterants in selected dietary supplements and their detection methods.,"At present, there is a growing trend toward the intentional adulteration of dietary supplements (DS) with synthetic pharmaceuticals, which represents an alarming emerging risk to consumers and a serious problem for regulatory agencies. An amazing array of synthetic drugs and their analogues have been reported as adulterants in DS. Mainly, the presence of analogues represents a serious health risk as their efficacy and toxic effects have not been clinically assessed yet and may result in unpredictable adverse effects. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview, over the period 2009-2019, of the most frequently reported adulterants in DS for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, obesity/overweight, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension and the analytical methods used for their detection.",Muschietti L; Redko F; Ulloa J,Drug testing and analysis,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32307880/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32298985,Overview of dietary supplements on patients with type 2 diabetes.,"The primary approach for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) involves lifestyle modification and diet therapy along with pharmacologic interventions. Many patients are interested to identify nutritional supplements that may provide benefit in prevention and management of diabetes. However, the efficacy and safety of nutritional supplements such as chromium, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), vitamin D, zinc and magnesium in disease treatment is a worrying and controversial matter. In this narrative review, patients and health care providers are introduced to the effects of mentioned dietary supplements that may help in choosing or not choosing these supplements in treatment of diabetes. This review was carried out using comprehensive and systematic literature reports on the dietary supplements in the management of diabetes. Empirical searches were conducted using Google Scholar, Science Direct and PubMed databases. Searches were also undertaken using keywords, in English, such as ""chromium"" OR ""vitamin D"" OR ""omega-3 fatty acids"" OR ""zinc"" OR ""magnesium"" in combination with ""type 2 diabetes"". The available evidence is insufficient to create a definite conclusion that nutritional supplements including chromium, n-3 PUFAs, vitamin D, zinc and magnesium might be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of T2DM and therefore, the general recommendation to use these supplements in the management of diabetes cannot be justified. The results of most studies lack uniformity across multiple aspects, including different dose and formation of supplements, duration, and subjects under intervention. There is a need for well-designed, high quality, large and long-term studies to strengthen the available evidence and ensure the safety and efficacy of products.",Behrouz V; Dastkhosh A; Sohrab G,Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32298985/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32290029,New Frontiers for the Use of IP6 and Inositol Combination in Treating Diabetes Mellitus: A Review.,"Inositol, or myo-inositol, and associated analog molecules, including myo-inositol hexakisphosphate, are known to possess beneficial biomedical properties and are now being widely studied. The impact of these compounds in improving diabetic indices is significant, especially in light of the high cost of treating diabetes mellitus and associated disorders globally. It is theorized that, within ten years, the global population of people with the disease will reach 578 million individuals, with the cost of care projected to be approximately 2.5 trillion dollars. Natural alternatives to pharmaceuticals are being sought, and this has led to studies involving inositol, and myo-inositol-hexakisphosphate, also referred to as IP6. It has been reported that IP6 can improve diabetic indices and regulate the activities of some metabolic enzymes involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Current research activities have been focusing on the mechanisms of action of inositol and IP6 in the amelioration of the indices of diabetes mellitus. We demonstrated that an IP6 and inositol combination supplement may regulate insulin secretion, modulate serum leptin concentrations, food intake, and associated weight gain, which may be beneficial in both prediabetic and diabetic states. The supplement attenuates vascular damage by reducing red cell distribution width. Serum HDL is increased while serum triglycerides tend to decrease with consumption of the combination supplement, perhaps due to the modulation of lipogenesis involving reduced serum lipase activity. We also noted increased fecal lipid output following combination supplement consumption. Importantly, liver function was found to be preserved. Concurrently, serum reactive oxygen species production was reduced, indicating that inositol and IP6 supplement consumption may reduce free radical damage to tissues and organs as well as serum lipids and blood glucose by preserving liver function. This review provides an overview of the findings associated with inositol and IP6 supplementation in the effective treatment of diabetes with a view to proposing the potential mechanisms of action.",Omoruyi FO; Stennett D; Foster S; Dilworth L,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32290029/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32260262,Effects of Bilberry Supplementation on Metabolic and Cardiovascular Disease Risk.,"Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of interrelated conditions that is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Oxidative stress may impair normal physiological functions, leading to various illnesses. T2DM is considered to be associated with increased oxidative stress, inflammation, and dyslipidemia, which may play a significant role in the development of cardiovascular complications, cancer and vision loss through cataracts and retinopathy. While conventional therapies are a cornerstone for the management of the major risk factors of metabolic syndrome, increasing antioxidant defense by increasing intake of antioxidant-rich foods may improve long term prospects in CVD, obesity and T2DM. Bilberry (<i>Vaccinium</i> <i>myrtillus</i> <i>L.</i>) is one of the richest natural sources of anthocyanins which give berries their red/purple/blue coloration. Anthocyanins are powerful antioxidants and are reported to play an important role in the prevention of metabolic disease and CVD as well as cancer and other conditions. This review focuses on the potential effects of bilberry supplementation on metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors. Although there is evidence to support the use of bilberry supplementation as part of a healthy diet, the potential benefits from the use of bilberry supplementation in patients with T2DM or CVD needs to be clarified in large clinical trials.",Chan SW; Tomlinson B,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32260262/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32244496,Role of Vitamin D in Preventing and Treating Selected Extraskeletal Diseases-An Umbrella Review.,"Evidence is accumulating that vitamin D may have beneficial effects on respiratory tract, autoimmune, neuro-degenerative, and mental diseases. The present umbrella review of systematic reviews (SRs) of cohort studies and randomised controlled trials (RCTs), plus single Mendelian randomisation studies aims to update current knowledge on the potential role of vitamin D in preventing and treating these extraskeletal diseases. Altogether, 73 SRs were identified. Observational data on primary prevention suggest an inverse association between vitamin D status and the risk of acute respiratory tract infections (ARI), dementia and cognitive decline, and depression, whereas studies regarding asthma, multiple sclerosis (MS), and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) are scarce. SRs of RCTs support observational data only for the risk of ARI. No respective RCTs are available for the prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), MS, and T1DM. SRs of RCTs indicate beneficial therapeutic effects in vitamin D-deficient patients with asthma and COPD, while effects on major depression and T1DM need to be further elucidated. Mendelian randomisation studies do not consistently support the results of SRs. Since several limitations of the included SRs and existing RCTs do not permit definitive conclusions regarding vitamin D and the selected diseases, further high-quality RCTs are warranted.",Maretzke F; Bechthold A; Egert S; Ernst JB; Melo van Lent D; Pilz S; Reichrath J; Stangl GI; Stehle P; Volkert D; Wagner M; Waizenegger J; Zittermann A; Linseisen J,Nutrients,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32244496/,0,1,0,0,0,0
32235743,"Histidine in Health and Disease: Metabolism, Physiological Importance, and Use as a Supplement.","L-histidine (HIS) is an essential amino acid with unique roles in proton buffering, metal ion chelation, scavenging of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, erythropoiesis, and the histaminergic system. Several HIS-rich proteins (e.g., haemoproteins, HIS-rich glycoproteins, histatins, HIS-rich calcium-binding protein, and filaggrin), HIS-containing dipeptides (particularly carnosine), and methyl- and sulphur-containing derivatives of HIS (3-methylhistidine, 1-methylhistidine, and ergothioneine) have specific functions. The unique chemical properties and physiological functions are the basis of the theoretical rationale to suggest HIS supplementation in a wide range of conditions. Several decades of experience have confirmed the effectiveness of HIS as a component of solutions used for organ preservation and myocardial protection in cardiac surgery. Further studies are needed to elucidate the effects of HIS supplementation on neurological disorders, atopic dermatitis, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, uraemic anaemia, ulcers, inflammatory bowel diseases, malignancies, and muscle performance during strenuous exercise. Signs of toxicity, mutagenic activity, and allergic reactions or peptic ulcers have not been reported, although HIS is a histamine precursor. Of concern should be findings of hepatic enlargement and increases in ammonia and glutamine and of decrease in branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine, and isoleucine) in blood plasma indicating that HIS supplementation is inappropriate in patients with liver disease.",Holeček M,Nutrients,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32235743/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32222291,Diabetes-specific formulas high in monounsaturated fatty acids and metabolic outcomes in patients with diabetes or hyperglycaemia. A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The aim of this study was to compare the metabolic benefits of diabetes-specific formulas (DSF) high in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) with standard formulas (STDF) in adult patients with type 1, type 2 diabetes or stress-induced hyperglycaemia. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted through a literature search using different electronic databases from the index date to December 2018. We included randomised controlled trials that assessed the health benefits of high MUFA DSF vs STDF. Included outcomes were glycaemic control, lipid metabolism and tolerance. Effect sizes were calculated as standardised mean differences (SMDs) (<0.4 were considered small, 0.4-0.7 moderate and >0.7 large). This systematic review was registered as CRD42018108931 on Prospero. Of 385 references reviewed, 18 studies involving 845 adults met our inclusion criteria and contributed to the meta-analysis. Use of a high MUFA DSF compared with a STDF was associated with a statistically significant decrease in peak of postprandial glucose [SMD -1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.44 to -0.61], incremental glucose response (SMD -1.19, 95% CI -1.71 to -0.68), area under the curve of plasma insulin (SMD -0.65, 95% CI -1.03 to -0.26), mean blood glucose level (SMD -0.41, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.19), glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) change (SMD -0.63, 95% CI -1.21 to -0.05), glucose variability (SMD -0.93, -1.55 to -0.31), mean administered insulin dose (SMD -0.49, 95% CI -0.85 to -0.14), mean blood triglycerides (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.03) and increase of mean blood high-density lipoproteins (SMD +0.42, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.76). Non-significant differences were found for tolerance [odds ratio (OR) 0.95, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.05]. This meta-analysis shows that a DSF (oral supplements and tube feeds) high in MUFAs can improve glucose control and metabolic risk factors among patients with diabetes or stress-induced hyperglycaemia compared with a STDF.",Sanz-París A; Matía-Martín P; Martín-Palmero Á; Gómez-Candela C; Camprubi Robles M,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32222291/,0,1,0,1,0,0
32212849,Emerging Mechanisms of Cardiovascular Protection for the Omega-3 Fatty Acid Eicosapentaenoic Acid.,"Patients with well-controlled LDL (low-density lipoprotein) levels still have residual cardiovascular risk associated with elevated triglycerides. Epidemiological studies have shown that elevated fasting triglyceride levels associate independently with incident cardiovascular events, and abundant recent human genetic data support the causality of TGRLs (triglyceride-rich lipoproteins) in atherothrombosis. Omega-3 fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), lower blood triglyceride concentrations but likely exert additional atheroprotective properties at higher doses. Omega-3 fatty acids modulate T-cell differentiation and give rise to various prostaglandins and specialized proresolving lipid mediators that promote resolution of tissue injury and inflammation. The REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial) with an EPA-only formulation lowered a composite of cardiovascular events by 25% in patients with established cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus and other cardiovascular risk factors. This clinical benefit likely arises from multiple molecular mechanisms discussed in this review. Indeed, human plaques readily incorporate EPA, which may render them less likely to trigger clinical events. EPA and DHA differ in their effects on membrane structure, rates of lipid oxidation, inflammatory biomarkers, and endothelial function as well as tissue distributions. Trials that have evaluated DHA-containing high-dose omega-3 fatty acids have thus far not shown the benefits of EPA alone demonstrated in REDUCE-IT. This review will consider the mechanistic evidence that helps to understand the potential mechanisms of benefit of EPA.",Mason RP; Libby P; Bhatt DL,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32212849/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32200440,Effects of Probiotics on Patients with Hypertension: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"This meta-analysis and systematic review was conducted to evaluate the effect of probiotics on blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and blood glucose changes in patients with hypertension. We searched the PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and ProQuest databases using a combination of MeSH and free text, from the inception of these databases to 20 January 2020, with no language restrictions. The quantitative PEDro scale method was used to assess the quality of the included studies. We used the random effects models to estimate the outcomes, with heterogeneity among the studies assessed using Cochran's Q statistic. Fourteen included studies published between 2002 and 2019 were included in the meta-analysis, reporting results of 846 hypertension participants. A significant reduction in SBP by - 2.05 mmHg (95% CI - 3.87, -0.24, P = 0.03), DBP by - 1.26 mmHg (95% CI - 2.51, - 0.004, P = 0.047), BMI by - 1.03 (95% CI - 1.28, - 0.97, P < 0.01), and blood glucose by - 0.18 mmol/L (95% CI - 0.30 - 0.05, P = 0.007) was observed following probiotics intervention. Our meta-analysis showed a modest but a significant reduction in SBP and DBP in patients with hypertension, particularly in those with diabetes mellitus, following probiotic supplementation. This effect was associated with treatment duration, dosage, and the age of subject but was not associated with single or multiple strains usage. Additionally, probiotic supplement had a beneficial effect in reducing BMI and blood glucose.",Chi C; Li C; Wu D; Buys N; Wang W; Fan H; Sun J,Current hypertension reports,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32200440/,0,1,0,1,0,0
32198674,Effect of viscous fiber supplementation on obesity indicators in individuals consuming calorie-restricted diets: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Dietary fiber has played a consistent role in weight management, with efficacy potentially attributed to increased viscous fiber consumption. To summarize the effects of viscous fiber on body weight and other anthropometric parameters, along with a calorie-deficient diet, through a systematic review and meta-analysis. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library were searched through July 24, 2019 for randomized controlled trials that assessed the effect of viscous fiber supplementation as part of a restricted calorie diet for ≥ 4 weeks relative to comparator diets. Data were pooled using the generic inverse-variance method with random-effects models and expressed as mean differences with 95% confidence intervals. Inter-study heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q and quantified with I<sup>2</sup>. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to evaluate the overall certainty of evidence. Findings from 15 studies (n = 1347) showed viscous fiber supplementation significantly decreased body weight (- 0.81 kg [- 1.20, - 0.41]; p < 0.0001), BMI (- 0.25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> [- 0.46, - 0.05]; p = 0.01), and body fat (- 1.39% [- 2.61, - 0.17]; p = 0.03), compared to control. No effect on waist circumference was found. The certainty of evidence was graded as ""moderate"" for body weight, BMI, and body fat based on downgrades for imprecision. Waist circumference was graded ""low"" for downgrades of inconsistency and imprecision. Viscous fiber within a calorie-restricted diet significantly improved body weight and other markers of adiposity in overweight adults and those with additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

32185236,Effects of Nutritional Strategies on Glucose Homeostasis in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common complications of pregnancy, and nutritional therapy is the basis of GDM treatment. However, the effects of different forms of nutritional supplementation on improving gestational diabetes are uncertain. We conducted a network meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of supplementation with different nutrients on glucose metabolism in women with GDM. We conducted a literature search using PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the differences between different nutritional strategies in women with GDM. The Cochrane tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis were used to compare and rank the effects of nutritional strategies for the improvement of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), serum insulin, and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). We included thirteen RCTs with a total of 754 participants. Compared with placebo, omega-3, magnesium, vitamin D, zinc, and probiotics were more beneficial for improving FPG, serum insulin, and HOMA-IR. Network analysis showed that vitamin D supplementation was superior to omega-3 (-3.64 mg/dL, 95% CI: -5.77 to -1.51), zinc (-5.71 mg/dL, 95% CI: -10.19 to -1.23), probiotics (-6.76 mg/dL, 95% CI: -10.02 to -3.50), and placebo (-12.13 mg/dL, 95% CI: -14.55 to -9.70) for improving FPG. Magnesium supplementation was more beneficial for decreasing serum insulin compared with probiotics (-5.10 <i>μ</i>IU/mL, 95% CI: -9.32 to -0.88) and placebo (-7.80 <i>μ</i>IU/mL, 95% CI: -9.32 to -0.88) and placebo (-7.80 . Vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced FPG and regulated HOMA-IR. Magnesium supplementation was superior in decreasing serum insulin than supplementation with other nutrients. Nutrient supplementation seemed to have an effect on glucose homeostasis maintenance in patients with GDM and may be considered an adjunctive therapy.",Jin S; Sha L; Dong J; Yi J; Liu Y; Guo Z; Hu B,Journal of diabetes research,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32185236/,0,1,0,0,0,0
32183680,Could Antioxidant Supplementation Delay Progression of Cardiovascular Disease in End-Stage Renal Disease Patients?,"In end-stage renal disease patients, the leading causes of mortality are of cardiovascular (CV) origin. The underlying mechanisms are complex, given that sudden heart failure is more common than acute myocardial infarction. A contributing role of oxidative stress is postulated, which is increased even at early stages of chronic kidney disease, is gradually augmented in parallel to progression to endstage renal disease and is further accelerated by renal replacement therapy. Oxidative stress ensues when there is an imbalance between reactive pro-oxidants and physiologically occurring electron donating antioxidant defence systems. During the last decade, a close association of oxidative stress with accelerated atherosclerosis and increased risk for CV and all-cause mortality has been established. Lipid peroxidation has been identified as a trigger for endothelial dysfunction, the first step towards atherogenesis. In order to counteract the deleterious effects of free radicals and thereby ameliorate, or delay, CV disease, exogenous administration of antioxidants has been proposed. Here, we attempt to summarize existing data from studies that test antioxidants for CV protection, such as vitamins E and C, statins, omega-3 fatty acids and N-acetylcysteine.",Roumeliotis S; Roumeliotis A; Gorny X; Mertens PR,Current vascular pharmacology,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32183680/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32180081,Consensus statement from 2<sup>nd</sup> International Conference on Controversies in Vitamin D.,"The 2<sup>nd</sup> International Conference on Controversies in Vitamin D was held in Monteriggioni (Siena), Italy, September 11-14, 2018. The aim of this meeting was to address ongoing controversies and timely topics in vitamin D research, to review available data related to these topics and controversies, to promote discussion to help resolve lingering issues and ultimately to suggest a research agenda to clarify areas of uncertainty. Several issues from the first conference, held in 2017, were revisited, such as assays used to determine serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration, which remains a critical and controversial issue for defining vitamin D status. Definitions of vitamin D nutritional status (i.e. sufficiency, insufficiency and deficiency) were also revisited. New areas were reviewed, including vitamin D threshold values and how they should be defined in the context of specific diseases, sources of vitamin D and risk factors associated with vitamin D deficiency. Non-skeletal aspects related to vitamin D were also discussed, including the reproductive system, neurology, chronic kidney disease and falls. The therapeutic role of vitamin D and findings from recent clinical trials were also addressed. The topics were considered by 3 focus groups and divided into three main areas: 1) ""Laboratory"": assays and threshold values to define vitamin D status; 2) ""Clinical"": sources of vitamin D and risk factors and role of vitamin D in non-skeletal disease and 3) ""Therapeutics"": controversial issues on observational studies and recent randomized controlled trials.

32168855,Exploring the Comparative Efficacy of Metformin and Resveratrol in the Management of Diabetes-associated Complications: A Systematic Review of Preclinical Studies.,"Food-derived bioactive compounds such as resveratrol are increasingly explored for their protective effects against metabolic complications. Evidence supports the strong antioxidant properties and therapeutic effects of resveratrol in managing diabetes and its associated complications. However, evidence informing on the comparative or combination effects of this natural compound with an accomplished and well-characterized antidiabetic agent like metformin has not been revised. Thus, we conducted a comprehensive systematic search of the major electronic databases which included MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE. The cumulative evidence strongly supports the comparative effects of metformin and resveratrol in ameliorating diabetes-associated complications in preclinical settings. In particular, both compounds showed strong ameliorative effects against hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, a pro-inflammatory response, and lipid peroxidation in various experimental models of diabetes. Enhancing intracellular antioxidant capacity in addition to activating NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) are the prime mechanisms involved in the therapeutic effects of these compounds. Of interest, preclinical evidence also demonstrates that the combination treatment with these compounds may have a greater efficacy in protecting against diabetes. Thus, confirmation of such evidence in well-organized clinical trials remains crucial to uncover novel therapeutic strategies to manage diabetes and its linked complications.",Dludla PV; Silvestri S; Orlando P; Gabuza KB; Mazibuko-Mbeje SE; Nyambuya TM; Mxinwa V; Mokgalaboni K; Johnson R; Muller CJF; Tiano L; Louw J; Nkambule BB,Nutrients,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32168855/,0,1,0,1,0,0
32165592,The Role of Dietary Antioxidants on Oxidative Stress in Diabetic Nephropathy.,"Diabetic nephropathy (ND) is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease and oxidative stress (OS) has been recognized as a key factor in the pathogenesis and progression.

32161549,Relationship Between Ginsenoside Rg3 and Metabolic Syndrome.,"Metabolic syndrome is an important public health issue and is associated with a more affluent lifestyle. Many studies of metabolic syndrome have been reported, but its pathogenesis remains unclear and there is no effective treatment. The ability of natural compounds to ameliorate metabolic syndrome is currently under investigation. Unlike synthetic chemicals, such natural products have proven utility in various fields. Recently, ginsenoside extracted from ginseng and ginseng root are representative examples. For example, ginseng is used in dietary supplements and cosmetics. In addition, various studies have reported the effects of ginsenoside on metabolic syndromes such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. In this review, we describe the potential of ginsenoside Rg3, a component of ginseng, in the treatment of metabolic syndrome.",Lee H; Kong G; Tran Q; Kim C; Park J; Park J,Frontiers in pharmacology,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32161549/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32145487,Influence of omega-3 fatty acid and vitamin co-supplementation on metabolic status in gestational diabetes: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies.,"Omega-3 fatty acid and vitamin E or D co-supplementation may be an important approach to improve metabolic status in gestational diabetes, but the results are conflicting. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of omega-3 fatty acid and vitamin co-supplementation on metabolic status in gestational diabetes. PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the influence of omega-3 fatty acid and vitamin co-supplementation compared with placebo on metabolic status in gestational diabetes were included. Two investigators independently searched articles, extracted data, and assessed the quality of included studies. Four RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with control interventions for gestational diabetes, omega-3 fatty acid and vitamin E or D co-supplementation was associated with significantly reduced fasting plasma glucose [mean difference (MD) -10.47, 95 % confidence interval (CI) -15.33 to -5.61, p < 0.0001], homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (MD -1.6, 95 % CI=-2.44 to -0.77, p = 0.0002), malondialdehyde (MD -1.00, 95 % CI -1.05 to -0.95, p < 0.00001) and triglycerides (MD 26.22, 95 % CI -38.94 to -13.51, p < 0.0001), as well as increased antioxidant capacity (MD 173.51, 95 % CI 164.72-182.30, p < 0.00001), but showed no obvious effect on nitric oxide (MD 5.95, 95 % CI -7.48 to 19.37, p = 0.39) or total cholesterol (MD 1.63, 95 % CI -13.46 to 16.72, p = 0.83).

32140423,United States Pharmacopeia (USP) comprehensive review of the hepatotoxicity of green tea extracts.,"As part of the United States Pharmacopeia's ongoing review of dietary supplement safety data, a new comprehensive systematic review on green tea extracts (GTE) has been completed. GTEs may contain hepatotoxic solvent residues, pesticide residues, pyrrolizidine alkaloids and elemental impurities, but no evidence of their involvement in GTE-induced liver injury was found during this review. GTE catechin profiles vary significantly with manufacturing processes. Animal and human data indicate that repeated oral administration of bolus doses of GTE during fasting significantly increases bioavailability of catechins, specifically EGCG, possibly involving saturation of first-pass elimination mechanisms. Toxicological studies show a hepatocellular pattern of liver injury. Published adverse event case reports associate hepatotoxicity with EGCG intake amounts from 140 mg to ∼1000 mg/day and substantial inter-individual variability in susceptibility, possibly due to genetic factors. Based on these findings, USP included a cautionary labeling requirement in its Powdered Decaffeinated Green Tea Extract monograph that reads as follows: ""<i>Do not take on an empty stomach. Take with food. Do not use if you have a liver problem and discontinue use and consult a healthcare practitioner if you develop symptoms of liver trouble, such as abdominal pain, dark urine, or jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes</i>).""",Oketch-Rabah HA; Roe AL; Rider CV; Bonkovsky HL; Giancaspro GI; Navarro V; Paine MF; Betz JM; Marles RJ; Casper S; Gurley B; Jordan SA; He K; Kapoor MP; Rao TP; Sherker AH; Fontana RJ; Rossi S; Vuppalanchi R; Seeff LB; Stolz A; Ahmad J; Koh C; Serrano J; Low Dog T; Ko R,Toxicology reports,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32140423/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32134090,Insight into the potential application of polyphenol-rich dietary intervention in degenerative disease management.,"In recent times, a great number of plants have been studied in order to identify new components with nutraceutical properties, among which are polyphenols. Dietary polyphenols represent a large group of bioactive molecules widely found in the food of plant origin and they have been found able to prevent the onset and progression of degenerative diseases, and to reduce and control their symptoms. These health protective effects have been mainly related to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, it must be considered that the application of isolated polyphenols as nutraceuticals is quite limited due to their poor systemic distribution and relative bioavailability. The present review highlights the potential effect of dietary intervention with polyphenol-rich food and plant extracts in patients with cancer, diabetes and neurodegenerative, autoimmune, cardiovascular and ophthalmic diseases, as well as the possible molecular mechanisms of action suggested in numerous studies with animal models.",Quero J; Mármol I; Cerrada E; Rodríguez-Yoldi MJ,Food & function,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32134090/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32096539,Why a d-β-hydroxybutyrate monoester?,"Much of the world's prominent and burdensome chronic diseases, such as diabetes, Alzheimer's, and heart disease, are caused by impaired metabolism. By acting as both an efficient fuel and a powerful signalling molecule, the natural ketone body, d-β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB), may help circumvent the metabolic malfunctions that aggravate some diseases. Historically, dietary interventions that elevate βHB production by the liver, such as high-fat diets and partial starvation, have been used to treat chronic disease with varying degrees of success, owing to the potential downsides of such diets. The recent development of an ingestible βHB monoester provides a new tool to quickly and accurately raise blood ketone concentration, opening a myriad of potential health applications. The βHB monoester is a salt-free βHB precursor that yields only the biologically active d-isoform of the metabolite, the pharmacokinetics of which have been studied, as has safety for human consumption in athletes and healthy volunteers. This review describes fundamental concepts of endogenous and exogenous ketone body metabolism, the differences between the βHB monoester and other exogenous ketones and summarises the disease-specific biochemical and physiological rationales behind its clinical use in diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, heart failure, sepsis related muscle atrophy, migraine, and epilepsy. We also address the limitations of using the βHB monoester as an adjunctive nutritional therapy and areas of uncertainty that could guide future research.",Soto-Mota A; Norwitz NG; Clarke K,Biochemical Society transactions,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32096539/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32093297,Possible Involvement of Vitamin C in Periodontal Disease-Diabetes Mellitus Association.,"Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is an important water-soluble vitamin found in many fruits and vegetables. It has well-documented beneficial effects on the human body and is used as a supplement, alone or in combination with other vitamins and minerals. Over recent years, research has focused on possible new therapeutic actions in chronic conditions including periodontal disease (PD). We conducted a systematic review on clinical trials from four databases (PubMed, Clinical Trials, Cochrane, Web of Science) which measured plasmatic/salivary levels of ascorbic acid in PD-diabetes mellitus (DM) association. Six studies were included in our review, three of them analyzing patients with different grades of PD and DM who received vitamin C as a treatment (500 mg vitamin C/day for 2 months and 450 mg/day for 2 weeks) or as part of their alimentation (guava fruits), in combination with standard therapies and procedures. Decreased levels of vitamin C were observed in PD patients with DM but data about efficacy of vitamin C administration are inconclusive. Given the important bidirectional relationship between PD and DM, there is a strong need for more research to assess the positive effects of ascorbic acid supplementation in individuals suffering from both diseases and also its proper regimen for these patients.",Bogdan M; Meca AD; Boldeanu MV; Gheorghe DN; Turcu-Stiolica A; Subtirelu MS; Boldeanu L; Blaj M; Botnariu GE; Vlad CE; Foia LG; Surlin P,Nutrients,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32093297/,0,1,0,0,0,0
32093220,Beneficial Effects of Walnuts on Cognition and Brain Health.,"Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation have important roles in the aging process, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and other brain disorders. Amyloid beta protein (Aβ) is the main component of amyloid plaques in the brains of people with AD. Several studies suggest that Aβ increases the generation of free radicals in neurons, which leads to oxidative damage and cell death. Aβ can also induce neuroinflammation by increasing pro-inflammatory cytokines and enzymes. Walnuts contain several components that have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Animal and human studies from our and other groups suggest that supplementation with walnuts in the diet may improve cognition and reduce the risk and/or progression of MCI and AD. In the transgenic AD mouse model (AD-tg), we have reported the beneficial effects of a diet with walnuts on memory, learning, motor coordination, anxiety, and locomotor activity. Human clinical trials have also suggested an association of walnut consumption with better cognitive performance and improvement in memory when compared to baseline in adults. Our recent study in AD-tg mice has shown that a walnut-enriched diet significantly improves antioxidant defense and decreases free radicals' levels, lipid peroxidation, and protein oxidation when compared to a control diet without walnuts. These findings suggest that a diet with walnuts can reduce oxidative stress by decreasing the generation of free radicals and by boosting antioxidant defense, thus resulting in decreased oxidative damage to lipids and proteins. An in vitro study with synthetic Aβ showed that walnut extract can inhibit Aβ fibrillization and solubilize the preformed Aβ fibrils, suggesting an anti-amyloidogenic property of walnuts. Because it takes many years for cognitive impairment and dementia to develop, we suggest that early and long-term dietary supplementation with walnuts may help to maintain cognitive functions and may reduce the risk of developing, or delay the onset and/or slow the progression of, MCI and dementia by decreasing Aβ fibrillization, reducing oxidative damage, increasing antioxidant defense, and decreasing neuroinflammation. Furthermore, several animal and human studies have suggested that walnuts may also decrease the risk or progression of other brain disorders such as Parkinson's disease, stroke, and depression, as well as of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Together, these reports suggest the benefits of a walnut-enriched diet in brain disorders and in other chronic diseases, due to the additive or synergistic effects of walnut components for protection against oxidative stress and inflammation in these diseases.",Chauhan A; Chauhan V,Nutrients,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32093220/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32089370,A systematic review on the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation on diabetic peripheral neuropathy.,"Vitamin D deficiency is known to be prevalent in patients with diabetes and in particular in those having symptoms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DN). Thus, it is worthy to investigate whether a supplementation of vitamin D would improve pain among those having diabetes and DN. A systematic literature search was performed to identify studies that reported the impact of vitamin D supplementation on the signs and symptoms of DN. Random effect models were used to meta-analyze effect sizes. Quality assessment was also performed. Four studies including 364 patients met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analytical results were as follows: Serum Vitamin D level change of 1.39 (95% CI = 1.220 to 1.573, p = 0.008), HbA1c change of 0.134 (95% CI = -0.153 to 0.418, p = 0.3), McGill Pain Questionnaire score of 1.14 (95% CI = 1.222 to 1.672, p < 0.0001), all in favor of the vitamin D supplementation group. Non-meta-analytical results of all individual studies showed significant amelioration of pain scores. One study reported no significant change in nerve conduction study. Pain improvement was not correlated to baseline or change in serum vitamin D level. Vitamin D supplementation could be an added value in the treatment of painful peripheral diabetic neuropathy. Amelioration in pain might be related to the absolute value of vitamin D attained following supplementation. The findings of this review are promising and further research with large sample randomized trials is warranted.",Yammine K; Wehbe R; Assi C,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32089370/,0,1,0,0,0,0
32088261,Phytohormones: Multifunctional nutraceuticals against metabolic syndrome and comorbid diseases.,"Metabolic syndrome is characterized by the co-occurrence of diverse symptoms initiating the development of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and a variety of comorbid diseases. The complex constellation of numerous comorbidities makes it difficult to develop common therapeutic approaches that ameliorate these pathological features simultaneously. The plant hormones abscisic acid, salicylic acid, auxin, and cytokinins, have shown promising anti-inflammatory and pro-metabolic effects that could mitigate several disorders relevant to metabolic syndrome. Intriguingly, besides plants, human cells and gut microbes also endogenously produce these molecules, indicating a role in the complex interplay between inflammatory responses associated with metabolic syndrome, the gut microbiome, and nutrition. Here, we introduce how bioactive phytohormones can be generated endogenously and through the gut microbiome. These molecules subsequently influence immune responses and metabolism. We also elaborate on how phytohormones can beneficially modulate metabolic syndrome comorbidities, and propose them as nutraceuticals.",Kim SW; Goossens A; Libert C; Van Immerseel F; Staal J; Beyaert R,Biochemical pharmacology,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32088261/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32085882,Dietary plant flavonoids in prevention of obesity and diabetes.,"Obesity and diabetes are the most prevailing chronic metabolic diseases worldwide from mainly lipid and glucose metabolic dysfunctions and their incidence is increasing at an alarming high rate. Obesity is characterized by excess fat accumulation in WAT and liver and is the central player of insulin resistance in the peripheral tissues from chronic inflammation, lipotoxicity and gut dysbiosis, and plays a key role for development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and vascular diseases. Diabetes mellitus, known as diabetes, is chiefly characterized by hyperglycaemia from impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance. Several identified mutant genes in insulin secretion and resistance and various environmental factors are considered responsible for the onset of this disease. Currently available oral synthetic drugs, biguanides, incretin mimetic, GLP-1R and PPAR agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors for management of obesity and diabetes have several adverse effects in patients on long-term use. Emerging evidence supports the efficacy of dietary plant flavonoids in prevention and attenuation of obesity and diabetes by the protection and proliferation of pancreatic beta-cells and improvement of their insulin secretory function via activation of cAMP/PKA signaling pathway as well as in the improvement of insulin sensitivity in the peripheral metabolic tisssues for glucose uptake and utilization via inhibition of inflammation, lipotoxicity and oxidative stress. These flavonoids improve GLUT-4 expression and translocation to plasma membrane by activation of insulin-sensitive PI3K/Akt signaling and insulin-independent AMPK, SIRT-1 and MOR activation pathways for regulation of glucose homeostasis, and improve fat oxidation and reduce lipid synthesis by regulation of related genes for lipid homeostasis in the body of obese diabetic animals. In this chapter, we have highlighted all these beneficial anti-obesity and antidiabetic potentials of some dietary plant flavonoids along with their molecular actions, bioavailability and pharmacokinetics. In addition, the present understanding and management of obesity and diabetes are also focused.",Dinda B; Dinda M; Roy A; Dinda S,Advances in protein chemistry and structural biology,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32085882/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32067842,Etiology of atherosclerosis informs choice of animal models and tissues for initial functional genomic studies of resveratrol.,"Resveratrol, a phytoalexin, is a natural polyphenol synthesized exclusively by plants in response to environmental stresses. However, the molecule has also many exogenous bioactivities in animal cells. These bioactivities may lead to anti-cancer and cardio-protective health benefits. Because cellular responses to the treatment with resveratrol include the changes of expression patterns, functional genomics is an attractive tool to study them. In recent and today's experimental practice, this mostly means microarray profiling of gene expression (using RNAs isolated from bulk tissues). Herein, we review such published studies undertaken in the context of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). CVDs are a number one public health problem in developed countries, outweighing in magnitude even cancer. In particular, we review the studies of resveratrol in several animal models relevant to CVDs. These models included: normal and pre-mature aging in mice, as well as atherogenic diet in mice / pigs / non-human primates. Additionally, there were few clinical studies published in the context of the comorbidities of atherosclerosis in humans (e.g. obesity, diabetes, hypertension). For the purposes of these studies, three types of samples were most commonly profiled with microarrays: the liver, the skeletal muscle, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Resveratrol-induced changes of gene expression typically mimicked those associated with calorie restriction and lifespan extension. They also opposed changes induced by the atherogenic diet. We conclude by discussing few experimental factors that were relatively neglected thus far, but which could be interesting to investigate in the future. These factors include sex and the exact formulation of resveratrol (plant extract, or synthetic chemical).",Huminiecki L; Atanasov AG; Horbańczuk J,Pharmacological research,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32067842/,0,1,0,0,0,0

Therefore, the aim of the study was systematically review and meta-analyze the effect of psyllium supplementation on blood pressure of hypertensive patients in randomized controlled trials. We searched six universal databases including; Pubmed/Medline, Ovid, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Embase, and Scopus until November 2018. Both combined and stratiﬁed analyzes were conducted. A fixed-effects or random- effects model was used to assess the mean effect sizes. An eventual 11 trials with 592 participants were considered as eligible for inclusion in the present meta-analysis. The meta-analysis revealed a significant reduction of 2.04 mmHg in systolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference, -2.04; 95% confidence interval, -2.82 to -1.63; p < 0.001). Whilst meta-regression highlighted that the hypotensive effect of psyllium was stronger in subjects with higher baseline blood pressure. Given the overarching benefits and lack of reported side effects, particularly for hypertensive patients, health care providers and clinicians should consider the use of psyllium supplementation for the treatment or abatement of hypertension, or hypertensive symptoms.",Clark CCT; Salek M; Aghabagheri E; Jafarnejad S,The Korean journal of internal medicine,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32066221/,0,1,0,1,0,0

PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane Library were systematically searched to find relevant records up to 22 August 2019. Standard mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to evaluate the effect of cinnamon supplementation on the outcomes of this study. In the case of heterogeneity, fixed and random effect models were used. The obtained data were analyzed by Stata 13. After excluding irrelevant records, 9 eligible articles were included.

32013822,Potential Therapeutic Effects of Exogenous Ketone Supplementation for Type 2 Diabetes: A Review.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is among the most prevalent non-communicable lifestyle diseases. We propose that overnutrition and low levels of physical activity can contribute to a vicious cycle of hyperglycemia, inflammation and oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction. The pathophysiological manifestations of T2D have a particular impact on the vasculature and individuals with T2D are at high risk of cardiovascular disease. Targeting aspects of the vicious cycle represent therapeutic approaches for improving T2D and protecting against cardiovascular complications. The recent advent of exogenous oral ketone supplements represents a novel, non-pharmacological approach to improving T2D pathophysiology and potentially protecting against cardiovascular disease risk.

32009777,Hesperidin: A Therapeutic Agent For Obesity.,"Obesity is a chronic metabolic disease caused by multiple factors and is considered to be a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, stroke and various cancers. Hesperidin, a flavanone glycoside, is a natural phenolic compound with a wide range of biological effects. Mounting evidence has demonstrated that hesperidin possesses inhibitory effect against obesity diseases. Our review discusses mechanisms of hesperidin in the treatment of obesity. Hesperidin regulates lipid metabolism and glucose metabolism by mediating AMPK and PPAR signaling pathways, directly regulates antioxidant index and anti-apoptosis, and indirectly mediates NF-κB signaling pathway to regulate inflammation to play a role in the treatment of obesity. In addition, hesperidin-enriched dietary supplements can significantly improve symptoms such as postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia.

32004236,Dietary management of blood glucose in medical critically ill patients with overweight/obesity.,"As the obesity epidemic continues, there is a greater proportion of patients with overweight, obesity, and other forms of adiposity-based chronic disease that require intensive care. Nutrition therapy in the ICU is a vital part of critical care but can be challenging in this setting because of the increased risk of stress hyperglycemia and adverse impact of obesity- and diabetes-related complications. Current guidelines favor early nutritional therapy with a hypocaloric, high-protein diet in patients with overweight/obesity. More aggressive protein intake may be useful in those with greater severity of overweight/obesity with an upper limit of 3 g/kg ideal body weight per day. Although there is no specific recommendation, choosing enteral formulas with higher fat content and slower digesting carbohydrates may assist with glucose control. Supplementation with immunonutrients is recommended, given their known benefits in obesity and in reducing inflammation, but must be done in an individualized manner. Aggressive nutritional therapy is crucial in patients with overweight/obesity to support ongoing metabolic demands. Although a hypocaloric high-protein feeding strategy is a starting point, nutritional therapy should be approached in an individualized manner taking into account age, weight and BMI, basal metabolism, nutrition status, complications, and comorbidities.",Srinath R; Mechanick JI,Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32004236/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Researchers found significant benefits in reducing risk of acute respiratory tract infections, many types of cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, premature death, and adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. In addition, 25(OH)D concentrations are low for various reasons in several categories of people, including the obese, those with dark skin living at higher latitudes, the elderly, and those who do not eat much eggs, fish, meat, or vitamin D fortified milk. Measuring 25(OH)D concentrations is one way to both increase the awareness of vitamin D's importance in maintaining good health and to encourage vitamin D supplementation or increased solar ultraviolet-B exposure to sustain well-being throughout life by reducing disease incidence. Although 20 ng/ml seems adequate to reduce risk of skeletal problems and acute respiratory tract infections, concentrations above 30 ng/ml have been associated with reduced risk of cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. Thus, judicious testing of 25(OH)D concentrations could reduce disease incidence and make treatment expenditures more cost-effective.",Grant WB; Al Anouti F; Moukayed M,European journal of clinical nutrition,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31996793/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31991435,Vitamin B12: An Intergenerational Story.,"Vitamin B12 is a fascinating nutrient in that it is made by microbes but is essential for human metabolism. Humans can get it only from animal origin foods. Dietary deficiency rather than an absorption defect (Pernicious anemia, intrinsic factor defect) is the commonest cause of deficiency in the world, contributed by cultural and economic imperatives. Indians have a large prevalence of subclinical B12 deficiency due to vegetarianism. Birth cohort with long-term serial follow-up (Pune Maternal Nutrition Study) has helped reveal the life-course evolution of B12 deficiency: genetics, transplacental and lactational transfer from the mother, influence of family environment, rapid childhood and adolescent growth, and low consumption of milk all made a contribution. A novel association of low maternal B12 status was with fetal growth restriction and increased risk factors of diabetes in the baby. After demonstrating adequate absorption of small (2 μg) dose of vitamin B12, and a noticeable improvement of metabolic parameters in a pilot trial, we planned a supplementation trial in adolescents to improve outcomes in their babies (a primordial prevention called Pune Rural Intervention in the Young Adolescent).

31991425,Vegan Diet in Young Children.,"The prevalence of restrictive diets, mainly vegetarian and vegan, is markedly on the increase in Europe and other Western countries. In young children and adolescents, not only weight and height but also neurocognitive and psychomotor development are all strongly influenced by the source, quantity, and quality of their nutrition. In studies done mainly in adult populations, a plant-based diet showed benefits in the reduced risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and some types of cancer. However, there is no clear evidence that a vegan diet started in early childhood confers a lasting health benefit. On the other hand, a vegan diet can be potentially critical for young children with risks of inadequate supply in terms of protein quality and energy as well as long-chain fatty acids, iron, zinc, vitamin D, iodine, calcium, and particularly vitamin B12. Deficiencies in these nutrients can lead to severe and sometimes irreversible developmental disorders. If such a diet is chosen for ethical, ecological, or health reasons, a well-planned, diversified diet with additional supplementation of vitamin B12, vitamin D, iodine, and potentially other micronutrients is crucial to ensure a healthy and nutritious intake during childhood.",Müller P,Nestle Nutrition Institute workshop series,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31991425/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31989713,Ginger and avocado as nutraceuticals for obesity and its comorbidities.,"Obesity is a worldwide epidemic and is one of the factors involved in the etiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Obesity induces low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress. The treatment for obesity involves changes in diet, physical activity, and even medication and surgery. Currently, the use of nutraceutical compounds is associated with health benefits. Ginger and avocado are used for many people all around the world; however, its effect as a nutraceutical compound is less known by the general population. For this reason, we searched information of the literature to point its effects on distinct mechanisms of defense against the obesity its comorbidities. The present review aimed showing that these nutraceuticals may be useful in obesity treatment. Reports have shown that ginger and avocado induce antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects by improving enzymatic activity and modulating obesity-related impairments in the anti-inflammatory system in different tissues, without side effects. Furthermore, ginger and avocado were found to be effective in reversing the harmful effects of obesity on blood lipids. In conclusion, on the basis of the positive effects of ginger and avocado in in vitro, animal, and human studies, these nutraceuticals may be useful in obesity treatment.",Tramontin NDS; Luciano TF; Marques SO; de Souza CT; Muller AP,Phytotherapy research : PTR,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31989713/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31964667,Vitamin D supplementation to improve pregnancy and perinatal outcomes: an overview of 42 systematic reviews.,"To review the evidence to assess effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy and associations of serum vitamin D levels with perinatal outcomes. Overview of systematic reviews (SRs). Searches conducted in January 2019: Ovid Medline (1946-), Cochrane Library databases. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, and full texts using predefined inclusion criteria: SRs evaluating vitamin D supplementation in pregnant women and/or examining the association between serum vitamin D levels reporting at least one predefined perinatal outcome. Only SRs with high AMSTAR scores were analysed. Data were extracted independently by one reviewer and checked by a second. Results were assessed for quality independently by two reviewers using GRADE criteria. Thirteen SRs were included, synthesising evidence from 204 unique primary studies. SRs of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with the highest level of evidence showed no significant benefit from vitamin D in terms of preterm birth (RR 1.00 (95% CI 0.77, 1.30); high quality), pre-eclampsia (RR 0.91 (0.45, 1.86); low quality), gestational diabetes (RR 0.65 (0.39, 1.08); very low quality), stillbirth (RR 0.75 (0.50, 1.12); high quality), low birth weight (RR 0.74 (0.47, 1.16); low quality), caesarean section (RR 1.02 (0.93, 1.12); high quality). A significant difference was found for small for gestational age (RR 0.72 (0.52, 0.99); low quality). SRs of observational studies showed associations between vitamin D levels and preterm birth (RR 1.19 (1.08, 1.31); moderate quality), pre-eclampsia (RR 1.57 (1.21, 2.03) for 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25 (OH)D)<50 nmol/L subgroup; low quality), gestational diabetes (RR 1.12 (1.02, 1.22) for 25 (OH)D<50 nmol/L and RR 1.09 (1.03, 1.15)<75 nmol/L; moderate quality) and small for gestational age (RR 1.35 (1.18, 1.54)<50 nmol/L; low quality). SRs showed mixed results for associations between vitamin D and low birth weight (very low quality) and caesarean section (very low quality). There is some evidence from SRs of observational studies for associations between vitamin D serum levels and some outcomes; however SRs examining effectiveness from RCTs showed no effect of vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy with the exception of one predefined outcome, which had low quality evidence. Credibility of the evidence in this field is compromised by study limitations (in particular, the possibility of confounding among observational studies), inconsistency, imprecision and potential for reporting and publication biases.",Bialy L; Fenton T; Shulhan-Kilroy J; Johnson DW; McNeil DA; Hartling L,BMJ open,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31964667/,0,1,0,0,0,0
31963899,Regulation of Skeletal Muscle Function by Amino Acids.,"Amino acids are components of proteins that also exist free-form in the body; their functions can be divided into (1) nutritional, (2) sensory, and (3) biological regulatory roles. The skeletal muscle, which is the largest organ in the human body, representing ~40% of the total body weight, plays important roles in exercise, energy expenditure, and glucose/amino acid usage-processes that are modulated by various amino acids and their metabolites. In this review, we address the metabolism and function of amino acids in the skeletal muscle. The expression of PGC1<i>α</i>, a transcriptional coactivator, is increased in the skeletal muscle during exercise. PGC1<i>α</i> activates branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism and is used for energy in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Leucine, a BCAA, and its metabolite, <i>β</i>-hydroxy-<i>β</i>-methylbutyrate (HMB), both activate mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and increase protein synthesis, but the mechanisms of activation appear to be different. The metabolite of valine (another BCAA), <i>β</i>-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA), is increased by exercise, is secreted by the skeletal muscle, and acts on other tissues, such as white adipose tissue, to increase energy expenditure. In addition, several amino acid-related molecules reportedly activate skeletal muscle function. Oral 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) supplementation can protect against mild hyperglycemia and help prevent type 2 diabetes. <i>β</i>-alanine levels are decreased in the skeletal muscles of aged mice. <i>β</i>-alanine supplementation increased the physical performance and improved the executive function induced by endurance exercise in middle-aged individuals. Further studies focusing on the effects of amino acids and their metabolites on skeletal muscle function will provide data essential for the production of food supplements for older adults, athletes, and individuals with metabolic diseases.",Kamei Y; Hatazawa Y; Uchitomi R; Yoshimura R; Miura S,Nutrients,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31963899/,1,0,0,0,0,0

31950031,Do Probiotics Improve the Health Status of Individuals with Diabetes Mellitus? A Review on Outcomes of Clinical Trials.,"Probiotics are now considered as an adjuvant and complementary therapeutic agent for several health complications, especially for metabolic and gastrointestinal disorders because of the influential impact of probiotic consumption on gut microbiota and immunity. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is fourth, in noncommunicable disease category, leading cause of mortality, morbidity, and economic crises in the world. Though several progressions are added in the medical field in recent decades, the treatment and management of diabetic-related health issues are still challenging. The present study summarizes the effects of probiotic supplementation on the health status of diabetic patients. The relevant information was collected from Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar. The detailed literature survey revealed that the consumption of probiotic supplementation significantly improved the overall health condition of diabetic patients. Especially, the probiotic intervention improved the fasting blood glucose, insulin sensitivity, and systemic inflammatory and antioxidant status in type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients. Moreover, improvement of gut microbial composition and prevention of bacterial translocation has also been observed in probiotic-supplemented T2D people. Some of the studies evidenced that the supplementation of probiotics can prevent and improve the gestational DM. Nevertheless, some of the studies reported negative results and limitations in the results of clinical trials. However, further studies are mandatory to develop a concrete probiotic-based adjuvant treatment procedure to treat DM.",Kesika P; Sivamaruthi BS; Chaiyasut C,BioMed research international,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31950031/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Several studies have demonstrated that they may also serve as a useful adjunct to pharmaceuticals to better manage chronic conditions or offset negative side effects. Individuals are advised to consult their physician before using nutraceuticals, but this advice is often overlooked. Thus, the community pharmacist plays an increasingly important role in assisting consumers with selecting a nutraceutical that is safe and for which there is evidence of therapeutic efficacy.

This is of particular relevance for chronic kidney disease (CKD), as the gut is a source of uremic retention solutes, which accumulate as a result of impaired kidney function and can exert nephrotoxic and other harmful effects. Kidney dysfunction is also associated with changes in the composition of the gut microbiota and the gastrointestinal tract. Diet modulates the gut microbiota, and there is much interest in the use of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics as dietary therapies in CKD, as well as dietary patterns that beneficially alter the microbiota. This review provides an overview of the gut microbiota and its measurement, its relevance in the context of CKD, and the current state of knowledge regarding dietary manipulation of the microbiota.",Snelson M; Biruete A; McFarlane C; Campbell K,Journal of renal nutrition : the official journal of the Council on Renal Nutrition of the National Kidney Foundation,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31928802/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31919792,Critical Differences Between Dietary Supplement and Prescription Omega-3 Fatty Acids: A Narrative Review.,"Currently available omega-3 (OM-3) fatty acid products in the US are either nonprescription dietary supplements (e.g., fish oils) or prescription (Rx) medications. As such, we aimed to describe critical therapeutic differences among the OM-3 fatty acids, focusing on differences between fish oil supplements and Rx OM-3s. A narrative review of known papers salient to this topic was conducted. Despite the multiple purported clinical benefits, the published evidence for OM-3 dietary supplements is generally insufficient, inconsistent, or negative. Rx OM-3 products are indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglycerides (TG) in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia (TG ≥ 500 mg/dl). Recently, the Rx eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-only OM-3, icosapent ethyl, demonstrated cardiovascular (CV) risk reduction among statin-treated patients at high risk of CV disease in a large CV outcomes trial (CVOT), and is now also indicated as an adjunct to maximally tolerated statin therapy to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, and unstable angina requiring hospitalization in adult patients with elevated TG (≥ 150 mg/dL) and established CVD or diabetes mellitus and ≥ 2 additional risk factors for CVD. In contrast to the rigorous regulatory standards for safety, efficacy, and manufacturing of medications (whether Rx or over the counter), the Food and Drug Administration manages dietary supplements as food. Issues specific to OM-3 dietary supplements include variable content, labeling inconsistencies, and poor product quality/impurity. Given these issues, OM-3 dietary supplements should not be substituted for Rx OM-3 products. The efficacy of the EPA-only Rx OM-3 product in a large CVOT cannot be extrapolated to other OM-3 products. Consumers and health care providers need to recognize critical differences between Rx and OM-3 dietary supplements to ensure appropriate use of each OM-3 product.",Hilleman DE; Wiggins BS; Bottorff MB,Advances in therapy,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31919792/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Women diagnosed with GDM earlier in pregnancy had a worse metabolic profile than those diagnosed later. A combined physical activity (PA) and healthy eating (HE) lifestyle intervention improved both behaviours, limited gestational weight gain (GWG) and was cost-effective. Although GDM risk was unchanged, neonatal adiposity was reduced due to less sedentary time. Neither PA nor HE alone limited GWG or GDM risk.

A review.","Since the early 2010s, dietary trans-palmitoleic acid (trans-9-hexadecenoic acid, trans-9-C16:1 in the Δ-nomenclature, trans-C16:1 n-7 in the Ω-nomenclature, TPA) has been epidemiologically associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes in humans. Thanks to these findings, TPA has become a nutrient of interest. However, there is a lot of unresolved crucial questions about this dietary fatty acid. Is TPA a natural trans fatty acid? What kind of foods ensures intakes in TPA? What about its metabolism? How does dietary TPA act to prevent type 2 diabetes? What are the biological mechanisms involved in this physiological effect? Clearly, it is high time to answer all these questions with the very first review specifically dedicated to this intriguing fatty acid. Aiming at getting an overview, we shall try to give an answer to all these questions, relying on appropriate and accurate scientific results. Briefly, this review underlines that TPA is indeed a natural trans fatty acid which is metabolically linked to other well-known natural trans fatty acids. Knowledge on physiological impacts of dietary TPA is limited so far to epidemiological data, awaiting for supplementation studies. In this multidisciplinary review, we also emphasize on methodological topics related to TPA, particularly when it comes to the quantification of TPA in foods and human plasma.

The aim of this meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was to assess the effects of ITF supplementation on glycemic control. PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library were searched for eligible articles up to March 6, 2019. A random-effects model was used to analyze the pooled results, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system was applied to assess the quality of evidence. The dose-response model was used to recommend the daily dose and duration for ITF supplementation. Thirty-three trials involving 1346 participants were included. Overall, ITF supplementation could significantly reduce concentrations of fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting insulin (FINS) and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). In the prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) population, a more significant reduction in FBG [weighted mean difference (WMD): - 0.60 mmol/l; 95% CI - 0.71, - 0.48 mmol/l; high rate], HbA1c (WMD: - 0.58%; 95% CI - 0.83, - 0.32%; high rate), FINS (WMD: - 1.75 µU/ml; 95% CI - 2.87, - 0.63 µU/ml; low rate), and HOMA-IR (WMD: - 0.69; 95% CI - 1.10, - 0.28; low rate) were observed, and ITF supplementation with a daily dose of 10 g for a duration of 6 weeks and longer was recommended. Moreover, subgroup analyses suggested that the effects of glycemic control were significantly influenced by the sex of the subjects and the type and the method of intake of ITF. Our analyses confirmed that these four main glycemic indicators were significantly reduced by ITF supplementation, particularly in the prediabetes and T2DM population. Evidence supports that reasonable administration of ITF supplementation may have potential clinical value as an adjuvant therapy for prediabetes and T2DM management.

31805673,Vitamin E Supplementation and Mitochondria in Experimental and Functional Hyperthyroidism: A Mini-Review.,"Mitochondria are both the main sites of production and the main target of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction with harmful consequences for the cells and the whole organism, resulting in metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, dementia, and aging. To protect themselves from ROS, mitochondria are equipped with an efficient antioxidant system, which includes low-molecular-mass molecules and enzymes able to scavenge ROS or repair the oxidative damage. In the mitochondrial membranes, a major role is played by the lipid-soluble antioxidant vitamin E, which reacts with the peroxyl radicals faster than the molecules of polyunsaturated fatty acids, and in doing so, protects membranes from excessive oxidative damage. In the present review, we summarize the available data concerning the capacity of vitamin E supplementation to protect mitochondria from oxidative damage in hyperthyroidism, a condition that leads to increased mitochondrial ROS production and oxidative damage. Vitamin E supplementation to hyperthyroid animals limits the thyroid hormone-induced increases in mitochondrial ROS and oxidative damage. Moreover, it prevents the reduction of the high functionality components of the mitochondrial population induced by hyperthyroidism, thus preserving cell function.",Napolitano G; Fasciolo G; Di Meo S; Venditti P,Nutrients,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31805673/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The aim of this review was to critically assess nutritional interventions for their impact on healthcare costs to community-dwelling individuals regarding T2DM or obesity or both, specifically using CHEERS (Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards) criteria to assess the economic components of the evidence. Searches were executed in Embase, EconLit, AgEcon, PubMed, and Web of Science databases. Studies were included if they had a nutritional perspective, reported an economic evaluation that included healthcare costs, and focused on obesity or T2DM or both. Studies were excluded if they examined clinical nutritional preparations, dietary supplements, industrially modified dietary components, micronutrient deficiencies, or undernutrition; if they did not report the isolated impact of nutrition in complex or lifestyle interventions; or if they were conducted in animals or attempted to transfer findings from animals to humans. A systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Using predefined search terms, 21 studies evaluating food habit interventions or taxation of unhealthy foods and beverages were extracted and evaluated using CHEERS criteria. Overall, these studies showed that nutrition interventions and taxation approaches could lead to cost savings and improved health outcomes when compared with current practice. All of the included studies used external sources and economic modeling or risk estimations with population-attributable risks to calculate economic outcomes. Most evidence supported taxation approaches. The effect of nutritional interventions has not been adequately assessed.

Insulin resistance (IR) is a pathophysiological condition related to diabetes and obesity. RS could reduce blood glucose and ameliorate IR in animals, but its effect in human population is controversial. The authors conducted a systematic literature review to evaluate the effect of RS diet supplement on ameliorating IR in patients with T2DM and simple obesity. Databases that supplemented with RS in ameliorating IR in T2DM and simple obesity were queried for studies on or before August 15, 2018. Parameters including fasting insulin, fasting glucose, body mass index (BMI), homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) etc. were extracted from studies to systemically evaluate effects of RS. The database search yielded 14 parallel or crossover studies that met the inclusion criteria. The results indicated that there was no significant difference in the amelioration of BMI, HOMA-%S and HOMA-%B in T2DM patients between RS and the non-RS supplementation. However, the fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR in T2DM with obesity who supplemented RS were lower than control group, and the subgroup analysis according to the dose of RS supplementation was inconsistency. There was no significant difference between RS and non-RS supplements in patients with simple obesity. RS supplementation can ameliorate IR in T2DM, especially for the patients of T2DM with obesity, but not in simple obesity.",Gao C; Rao M; Huang W; Wan Q; Yan P; Long Y; Guo M; Xu Y; Xu Y,Lipids in health and disease,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31760943/,0,1,0,1,0,0
31758631,Association of magnesium consumption with type 2 diabetes and glucose metabolism: A systematic review and pooled study with trial sequential analysis.,"Prevention of type 2 diabetes (T2D) with diet or diet supplementation is challenging. This article aims to draw conclusive associations between magnesium intake and T2D incidence and evaluate the effect of magnesium supplementation on glucose metabolism. Databases were searched for related articles from inception to May 15, 2019. Prospective cohort studies investigating the relevant relationship as well as randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of magnesium supplementation were eligible. We conducted trial sequential analysis (TSA) to prove the sufficiency of the current evidence. Twenty-six publications involving 35 cohorts were included in the analysis. Compared to the lowest magnesium intake, the highest level was associated with a 22% lower risk for T2D; the risk was reduced by 6% for each 100 mg increment in daily magnesium intake. Additional analysis of 26 RCTs (1168 participants) was performed, revealing that magnesium supplementation significantly reduced the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level (SMD, -0.32 [95% CI, -0.59 to -0.05], 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (2-h OGTT) result (SMD, -0.30 [-0.58 to -0.02]), fasting insulin level (SMD, -0.17 [-0.30 to -0.04]), homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) score (SMD, -0.41 [-0.71 to -0.11]), triglyceride (TG) level, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). TSA showed an inverse association, with most benefits of magnesium supplementation on glucose metabolism being stable.

31732292,"The significant role of carnitine and fatty acids during pregnancy, lactation and perinatal period. Nutritional support in specific groups of pregnant women.","Pregnancy is characterized by a complexity of metabolic processes that may impact fetal health and development. Women's nutrition during pregnancy and lactation is considered important for both mother and infant. This review aims to investigate the significant role of fatty acids and carnitine during pregnancy and lactation in specific groups of pregnant and lactating women.

31722135,[Lipoic acid: physiological role and prospects for clinical application].,"α-Lipoic acid (also known as thioctic acid) is a natural vitamin-like compound. Lipoic acid contains asymmetrical carbon, which causes the presence of two possible optical isomers (enantiomers): R-lipoic acid (levogyrate isomer) and S-lipoic acid (rightspinning isomer). Lipoic acid functions as a cofactor for several important mitochondrial multienzyme complexes, enhances the uptake of glucose by the cells, and modulates the activity of various signaling molecules and transcription factors. It was shown that α-lipoic acid and its derivative, dihydrolipoic acid, have a direct antioxidant effect due to the neutralization of reactive oxygen species that are destructive to DNA, proteins and lipids of cells. Dihydrolipoic acid enhances the antioxidant properties of ascorbic acid, glutathione and ubiquinone. Available evidence suggests that supplementation with lipoic acid reduces the symptoms of peripheral diabetic neuropathy. Results from randomized controlled trials show that high doses of lipoic acid can improve the glycemic profile of subjects with metabolic disorders. Lipoic acid can be used to control body weight in people with obesity. R-Lipoic acid is synthesized in the human body and is contained in foods in a form covalently associated with lysine (lipoyllysine). Its dose in dietary supplements significantly exceeds the amount in the diet. Most dietary supplements contain a racemic mixture of R- and S-lipoic acid.",Tutelyan VA; Makhova AA; Pogozheva AV; Shikh EV; Elizarova EV; Khotimchenko SA,Voprosy pitaniia,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31722135/,1,0,0,0,0,0

There is growing evidence regarding the influence of selenium (Se) on pregnancy and fetus outcomes. However, due to as yet insufficient evidence, lack of measurable markers to assess the effect of Se supplementation on the human metabolism, and Se's narrow therapeutic index, the majority of experts and the current guidelines published by several scientific societies do not recommend the use of Se in pregnancy and in women of childbearing age.

31701489,Evidence for a manifold role of selenium in infertility.,"This review aimed to assess the evidence from observational and interventional studies in humans and animals regarding the role of selenium (Se) in male and female infertility. As oxidative stress can seriously impair male, and possibly also female, reproductive functions, it can be speculated that the antioxidant properties of Se could constitute one of the pathways by which this element is involved in fertility. Specifically, there are strong indications that Se influences the growth, maturation, and replication of oocytes, though the precise mechanisms have not as yet been fully elucidated. Given that it is not clear at present which tissue sample (blood, serum, seminal plasma, sperm, or follicular fluid) renders the most accurate picture of Se concentration in terms of its role in reproduction, the data are still insufficient to recommend routine assessment of Se status in men and women seeking fertility. Nevertheless, the existing evidence, despite being of limited quantity and somewhat low quality, suggests that Se supplementation (< 200 μg/d) is possibly beneficial in men through its improvement of sperm motility. Well-designed, randomized control studies are needed to reveal the seemingly diverse protective/positive role of Se supplementation in men and women seeking fertility treatment.",Mintziori G; Mousiolis A; Duntas LH; Goulis DG,"Hormones (Athens, Greece)",2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31701489/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31688095,"Effect of branched-chain amino acid supplementation, dietary intake and circulating levels in cardiometabolic diseases: an updated review.","Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are essential amino acids derived from diet. BCAA supplementation has been recommended in elderly and athletes, but recent studies suggest an association between high dietary BCAAs and blood levels of BCAAs with greater risk of cardiometabolic diseases (CMD). This review aims to integrate current epidemiological evidence analyzing the association between BCAAs and related-CMD risk factors. Most epidemiological studies consistently show that dietary BCAAs are associated with higher risk of type-2 diabetes (T2D) whereas there is limited evidence related with other cardiovascular risk factors. Evidence also exists showing an association between higher circulating BCAA levels and risk of T2D and cardiovascular disease, and also probably with metabolic syndrome and overweight/obesity. Several clinical trials suggest beneficial cardiometabolic effect of BCAAs supplementation, although with a small sample size and short follow-up. Studies show a weak correlation between dietary BCAAs and circulating BCAA levels. Protein quality sources and whole dietary pattern are key aspects to improve our understanding of the effect of BCAAs as well as factors associated with higher protein needs, such as age or frailty. Dietary and circulating BCAAs exhibit possible detrimental cardiometabolic effects, but BCAA supplementation may have some positive influence on target groups with nutritional deficiencies.",de la O V; Zazpe I; Ruiz-Canela M,Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31688095/,1,0,0,0,0,1
31669079,Vitamin D Supplementation during Pregnancy: An Evidence Analysis Center Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Given the high rates of vitamin D deficiency among pregnant women and possible effects on offspring health, a systematic review on this topic was conducted to help inform future practice guidelines. To evaluate associations between maternal vitamin D supplementation, maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations, and health outcomes. A PubMed literature search was conducted to identify studies that examined the health effects of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy on maternal and infant health outcomes published from 2000 to 2016. Among 976 identified publications, 20 randomized clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. The initial search was extended to include five studies published between July 2016 and September 2018. Maternal and infant 25(OH)D concentrations, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, cesarean section, maternal parathyroid hormone and calcium concentrations, and infant gestational age, birth weight, and birth length. Mean differences, odds ratios, and 95% CIs were calculated, only for the initial search, using separate random-effects meta-analyses for each outcome. Evidence was good or strong that maternal vitamin D supplementation significantly increased maternal (13 studies, n=18, mean difference, 14.1 ng/mL [35.2 nmol/L]; 95% CI=9.6-18.6 ng/mL [24.0-46.4 nmol/L]) and infant (nine studies, n=12; 9.7, 5.2, 14.2 ng/mL [24.2, 12.9, 35.5 nmol/L]) 25(OH)D concentrations, although heterogeneity was significant (I<sup>2</sup>=95.9% and I<sup>2</sup>=97.4, respectively, P<0.001). Evidence was fair that vitamin D supplementation significantly decreases maternal homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (five studies, n=7; -1.1, -1.5, -0.7) and increases infant birth weight (nine studies, n=11, 114.2, 63.4, 165.1 g), both had insignificant heterogeneity. A null effect of maternal supplementation on other maternal (preeclampsia, cesarean section) and infant (gestational age, birth length) outcomes was found. Results show vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy improves maternal and infant 25(OH)D concentrations and may play a role in maternal insulin resistance and fetal growth. To further inform practice and policies on the amount of vitamin D, which supports a healthy pregnancy, high quality dose-response randomized clinical trials, which assess pregnancy-specific 25(OH)D thresholds, and appropriately powered clinical outcomes are needed.",Gallo S; McDermid JM; Al-Nimr RI; Hakeem R; Moreschi JM; Pari-Keener M; Stahnke B; Papoutsakis C; Handu D; Cheng FW,Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31669079/,0,1,0,1,0,0
31666474,The Effects of BCAAs on Insulin Resistance in Athletes.,"The toxic catabolic intermediates of branched chain amino acids can cause insulin resistance, and are involved in different mechanisms in different metabolic tissues. In skeletal muscle, 3-hydroxy-isobutyrate produced by valine promotes skeletal muscle fatty acid uptake, resulting in the accumulation of incompletely oxidized lipids in skeletal muscle, causing skeletal muscle insulin resistance. In the liver, branched-chain α-keto acids decompose in large amounts, promote hepatic gluconeogenesis, and lead to the accumulation of multiple acylcarnitines, which damages the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle, resulting in the accumulation of incomplete oxidation products, oxidative stress in mitochondria, and hepatic insulin resistance. In adipose tissue, the expression of branched-chain amino acid catabolic enzymes (branched-chain amino acid transaminase, branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase) is reduced, resulting in an increased level of plasma branched-chain amino acids, thereby causing massive decomposition of branched-chain amino acids in tissues such as skeletal muscle and liver, and inducing insulin resistance. However, branched-chain amino acids, as a common nutritional supplement for athletes, do not induce insulin resistance. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that exercise can enhance the mitochondrial oxidative potential of branched-chain amino acids, alleviate or even eliminate the accumulation of branched-chain amino acid catabolic intermediates, and promotes branched-chain amino acids catabolism into beta-aminoisobutyric acid, increasing plasma beta-aminoisobutyric acid concentration, improving insulin resistance. This article reveals the mechanism of BCAA-induced insulin resistance and the relationship between exercise and BCAAs metabolism, adds a guarantee for the use of BCAAs, and provides a new explanation for the occurrence of diabetes and how exercise improves diabetes.",Shou J; Chen PJ; Xiao WH,Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31666474/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31652543,Improving Health-Promoting Effects of Food-Derived Bioactive Peptides through Rational Design and Oral Delivery Strategies.,"Over the last few decades, scientific interest in food-derived bioactive peptides has grown as an alternative to pharmacological treatments in the control of lifestyle-associated diseases, which represent a serious health problem worldwide. Interest has been directed towards the control of hypertension, the management of type 2 diabetes and oxidative stress. Many food-derived antihypertensive peptides act primarily by inhibiting angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), and to a lesser extent, renin enzyme activities. Antidiabetic peptides mainly inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) activity, whereas antioxidant peptides act through inactivation of reactive oxygen species, free radicals scavenging, chelation of pro-oxidative transition metals and promoting the activities of intracellular antioxidant enzymes. However, food-derived bioactive peptides have intrinsic weaknesses, including poor chemical and physical stability and a short circulating plasma half-life that must be addressed for their application as nutraceuticals or in functional foods. This review summarizes the application of common pharmaceutical approaches such as rational design and oral delivery strategies to improve the health-promoting effects of food-derived bioactive peptides. We review the structural requirements of antihypertensive, antidiabetic and antioxidant peptides established by integrated computational methods and provide relevant examples of effective oral delivery systems to enhance solubility, stability and permeability of bioactive peptides.",Manzanares P; Gandía M; Garrigues S; Marcos JF,Nutrients,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31652543/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31652143,Arginine supplementation and cardiometabolic risk.,"Because arginine is the substrate for nitric oxide synthesis, which is pivotal to vascular homeostasis and linked to the insulin response, it has long been posited that supplemental arginine could benefit cardiometabolic health. Recent data have supported the view that supplemental arginine could alleviate the initiation and development of endothelial dysfunction and also shown that it may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. One important finding is that these effects may indeed vary as a function of the amount of arginine, its form and notably the metabolic status of the population. Some studies have shown that low doses of slow-release arginine are better used for nitric oxide synthesis and beneficial in individuals with abnormal arginine metabolism/bioavailability. Pathophysiological data in rodents have emphasized the importance of arginase activation during the development of cardiometabolic risk, which lends credence to a potential benefit for arginine supplements. Likewise, epidemiological evidence suggests that alterations to arginine bioavailability are important regarding the cardiometabolic risk. However, other metabolic mechanisms linked to the multiple pathways of arginine metabolism may also play a role. Further studies are needed to confirm and analyze how and when supplemental arginine is beneficial to cardiometabolic health.",Mariotti F,Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31652143/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Vitamin D supplementation to adults who were vitamin D sufficient or insufficient did not reduce risk for developing cardiovascular disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes nor increases bone mineral density (BMD). Patients who were vitamin D deficient with cancer and received vitamin D reduced risk for mortality by 25% and prediabetic adults who were vitamin D deficient and received vitamin D reduced their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 62%. Older adults receiving 4000 and 10 000 IUs of vitamin D3 daily for 3 years had reduced radial BMD but had no change in either total hip areal bone density or bone strength in the radius and tibia.

Although the pathophysiology of CKD is complicated and has not been fully understood, the elevated oxidative stress is considered to play a central role in the development of this disease, thus it becomes an attractive target for CKD prevention or management. The grape extract is one of the rich sources of antioxidants. Literature demonstrates that the consumption of grape antioxidants has significant benefits to the reduction of oxidative stress in different health conditions. In this article, we reviewed the role of the oxidative stress in CKD pathophysiology, and both the preclinical and clinical findings of anti-oxidative activity of proanthocyanidins in grape extracts (catechin, epicatechin, procyanidin B1 and procyanidin), particularly in subjects with CKD.

31619648,Myo-Inositol for the Prevention of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus. A Brief Review.,"Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is one of the most frequent complications of pregnancy and is characterized by a carbohydrate intolerance which is diagnosed with the oral glucose tolerance test. The prevalence of GDM in our population is about 12%, but risk factors like a previous GDM, ethnicity, a parent with diabetes mellitus type 2 and maternal overweight may increase its occurrence. Complications of GDM are a pre-term birth (before 37 wk gestation), macrosomia (birth weight ≥4 kg) and gestational hypertension. Actually, GDM is principally treated with diet and, if it is necessary, with insulin; but the challenge is the prevention of GDM. Among the measures used, changes in life-style (diet+exercise) failed to prevent GDM whereas metformin showed conflicting results. A promising supplement is myo-inositol (MI) which was given from first trimester until delivery to women at risk for GDM reporting a significant decrease in GDM occurrence by more than 60% comparing to the placebo group. Recently, a secondary analysis from 3 randomized controlled trials demonstrated that MI may also significantly reduce some of GDM complications such as pre-term birth and macrosomia with a favorable impact on mother and fetus well being.",D'Anna R; Santamaria A; Alibrandi A; Corrado F; DI Benedetto A; Facchinetti F,Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31619648/,1,0,0,0,0,0

31615079,A Review of the Potential Benefits of Increasing Vitamin D Status in Mongolian Adults through Food Fortification and Vitamin D Supplementation.,"Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations are low in Mongolia, averaging 22 ng/mL in summer and only 8 ng/mL in winter. Mongolians have high incidence and/or prevalence of several diseases linked to low 25(OH)D concentrations, including ischemic heart disease, malignant neoplasms, cirrhosis of the liver, ischemic stroke, lower respiratory tract infections, preterm birth complications, and diabetes mellitus. Fortifying regularly consumed foods such as flour, milk, and edible oils with vitamin D<sub>3</sub> could raise 25(OH)D concentrations by about 10 ng/mL. However, to achieve 25(OH)D concentrations of 30-40 ng/mL in adults, vitamin D intakes of 1000 to 4000 IU/day would be required, making personal supplement use necessary. On the basis of prospective observational studies and clinical trials of disease incidence or known mortality rates and adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, raising mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations to 40 ng/mL would likely reduce incidence and mortality rates for those and other diseases, reduce the rate of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, and increase mean life expectancy by one year or more.",Grant WB; Boucher BJ,Nutrients,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31615079/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31612820,Plant- and Nutraceutical-based Approach for the Management of Diabetes and its Neurological Complications: A Narrative Review.,"Diabetes is an important metabolic disease affecting many organs and systems in the body. The nervous system is one of the body systems affected by diabetes and neuropathic complications are troublesome in diabetic patients with many consequences. As diabetes has deleterious influences almost on bodily systems, an integrative approach seems to be necessary accepting the body as a whole and integrating body systems with lifestyle and living environment. Like some traditional health systems such as Ayurveda, integrative approach includes additional modalities to overcome both diabetes and diabetic complications. In general, these modalities consist of nutraceuticals and plant products. Prebiotics and probiotics are two types of nutraceuticals having active ingredients, such as antioxidants, nutrient factors, microorganisms, etc. Many plants are indicated for the cure of diabetes. All of these may be employed in the prevention and in the non-pharmacological management of mildto- moderate diabetes. Severe diabetes should require appropriate drug selection. Being complementary, prebiotics, probiotics, plants and exercise may be additive for the drug therapy of diabetes. Similarly, there are complementary approaches to prevent and cure neurological and/or behavioral manifestations of diabetes, which may be included in therapy and prevention plans. A scheme is given for the prevention and therapy of comorbid depression, which is one of the most common behavioral complications of diabetes. Within this scheme, the main criterion for the selection of modalities is the severity of diseases, so that personalized management may be developed for diabetic patients using prebiotics and probiotics in their diets, plants and drugs avoiding possible interactions.",Öztürk Y; Öztürk N,Current pharmaceutical design,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31612820/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31611873,Therapeutic Potential of ω-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Human Autoimmune Diseases.,"The recognition of ω-3 polyunsaturated acids (PUFAs) as essential fatty acids to normal growth and health was realized more than 80 years ago. However, the awareness of the long-term nutritional intake of ω-3 PUFAs in lowering the risk of a variety of chronic human diseases has grown exponentially only since the 1980s (1, 2). Despite the overwhelming epidemiological evidence, many attempts of using fish-oil supplementation to intervene human diseases have generated conflicting and often ambiguous outcomes; null or weak supporting conclusions were sometimes derived in the subsequent META analysis. Different dosages, as well as the sources of fish-oil, may have contributed to the conflicting outcomes of intervention carried out at different clinics. However, over the past decade, mounting evidence generated from genetic mouse models and clinical studies has shed new light on the functions and the underlying mechanisms of ω-3 PUFAs and their metabolites in the prevention and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis, and type 1 diabetes.

31606349,Current and future aspects of several adjunctive treatment strategies in polycystic ovary syndrome.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age. PCOS is characterized by hyperandrogenism, menstrual disorders, and polycystic ovarian morphology. PCOS patients have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and infertility. The mechanism of PCOS is not yet fully understood, but insulin resistance and genetic factors may play distinct roles in the pathomechanism. There is ongoing research on new therapeutic modalities for women with PCOS. In this minireview, we assessed the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of selected adjunctive agents (metformin, statins, resveratrol, melatonin, and inositols) for the treatment of women with PCOS. Metformin is a safe medication used in PCOS for 25 years that is currently recommended in select PCOS subpopulations, such as adolescents, women with metabolic disorders, and infertility infertile women undergoing ovarian hyperstimulation. Statins are also suggested in PCOS therapy, as these compounds decrease testosterone concentrations, improve lipid profiles, and ameliorate inflammatory reactions. Despite promising results, the role of statins in PCOS management needs to be further validated. Dietary supplements have also been tested in PCOS patients. Resveratrol was shown to decrease total testosterone production and improve fasting insulin but, until recently, only in one randomized study. Data on the therapeutic efficacy of melatonin and inositols on endocrine and metabolic abnormalities are limited and inconclusive. The multifactorial etiology of PCOS makes tailoring of its treatment more demanding, and there is a constant need for causative and effective modes of PCOS therapy.",Banaszewska B; Pawelczyk L; Spaczynski R,Reproductive biology,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31606349/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31604414,Nopal (Opuntia spp.) and its Effects on Metabolic Syndrome: New Insights for the Use of a Millenary Plant.,"Nopal (Opuntia spp.) is by excellence the most utilized cactus in human and animal nutrition. It is also a very noble plant; its main physicochemical, nutritional and nutraceutical characteristics allow the use of nopal in diverse food applications. Special focus has been given over the past decades in the use of Opuntia for the treatment of metabolic syndrome (MetS), which is predominantly related to Diabetes Mellitus. In this sense, the prevalence of MetS is increasing at a worldwide level. This in turn has led to a notorious demand for natural and nutraceutical food sources. The objective of this work was to summarize the main contributions in the field of Opuntia spp. research highlighting the potential use of nopal fruits or cladodes in MetS treatment, providing the reader with historical and novel information in this field. Nevertheless, the present work is not a meta-analysis. We included mainly information from recognized scientific databases, such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar. No homeopathic based studies were included since they lack scientific validation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review that fairly categorizes the majority of the information in this field into subsections, which can be of interest for the reader, such as the effect of nopal against cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity among others. Nopal constitutes one of the most studied members of the Cactaceae family; its potential effects on human health have been described since ancient times, mostly through traditional medicine.

Lifestyle modifications such as energy restriction and increased physical activity are highly effective first-line treatment strategies used in the management of obesity. However, adherence to these behavioral changes is poor, with an increased reliance on synthetic drugs, which unfortunately are plagued by adverse effects. The identification of new and safer anti-obesity agents is thus of significant interest. In recent years, plants and their phenolic constituents have attracted increased attention due to their health-promoting properties. Amongst these, Cyclopia, an endemic South African plant commonly consumed as a herbal tea (honeybush), has been shown to possess modulating properties against oxidative stress, hyperglycemia, and obesity. Likewise, several studies have reported that some of the major phenolic compounds present in Cyclopia spp. exhibit anti-obesity effects, particularly by targeting adipose tissue. These phenolic compounds belong to the xanthone, flavonoid and benzophenone classes.

However, whether the effects are generalizable to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) remains uncertain. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of probiotic supplement in GDM. PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and EBSCO were systematically searched for relevant literature published through January 2019. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of probiotic supplement on one or more of the following in GDM were included: pregnancy outcome (the primary outcome), glycemic control, blood lipid profile, and inflammation and oxidative stress. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in studies. Meta-analysis was conducted by using the fixed effects model unless substantial heterogeneity was found among studies. Eleven randomized trials involving 719 participants were included for analysis. Eight of the trials were from Iran. Probiotics were given alone in eight trials and synbiotics in three trials. Though the components of probiotics varied, Lactobacillus was included in all trials and Bifidobacterium in all except one. The duration of intervention ranged from 4 to 8 weeks. Almost all trials (10/11) had a low risk of bias. Probiotic supplementation reduced the risk of a newborn's hyperbilirubinemia by 74% and improved four biomarkers for glycemic control (fasting blood glucose, fasting serum insulin, homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance, and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index), two biomarkers for lipid profile (triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol), and four biomarkers for inflammation and oxidative stress (total glutathione, malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, and total antioxidant capacity). But significant heterogeneity was observed in the meta-analyses on the four biomarkers related to glycemic control and on triglycerides, which could not be explained by prespecified subgroup analyses according to the mean age of participants and intervention type (i.e., probiotics or synbiotics). The effects on the risk of preterm delivery, macrosomia and a newborns' hypoglycemia, gestational age, total cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol were not statistically significant. Probiotic supplementation seemed to be able to reduce the risk of a newborn's hyperbilirubinemia and improve glycemic control, blood lipid profiles and inflammation and oxidative stress in pregnant women with GDM. However, due to the heterogeneity among existing studies, the surrogate nature of outcomes, and/or the fact that most studies were from Iran, the clinical significance and generalizability of the above findings remain uncertain. Further studies are warranted to address the limitations of existing evidence and better inform the management of GDM.",Zhang J; Ma S; Wu S; Guo C; Long S; Tan H,Journal of diabetes research,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31583250/,0,1,0,1,0,0
31582621,Prevention of Cardiovascular Events with Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and the Mechanism Involved.,"An epidemiological study of Greenlandic Inuit suggested that fish oil, or omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), was important in preventing atherosclerotic disease. After this landmark study, many large-scale epidemiological studies and meta-analyses have examined the health benefits of omega-3 PUFA as part of a fatty acid-rich diet to demonstrate its beneficial roles in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Recent research has also focused attention on the anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3 PUFA and on specialized pro-resolving mediators. Findings of these studies have led to the development of omega-3 PUFA preparations for the treatment of dyslipidemia, including a highly purified eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-ethyl ester product (Epadel<sup>®</sup>) in Japan and an EPA/docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) preparation (Lotriga<sup>®</sup>) in the United States and Europe. Although various large-scale clinical trials on the cardiovascular preventive effect of omega-3 PUFA were conducted and reported, the results were not always consistent. The issues of not targeting subjects with hypertriglyceridemia and using low dose of omega-3 PUFA have been suggested to contribute to the failure of demonstrating the preventive effect of omega-3 PUFA in these clinical trials. Taking into account the above issues, the REDUCE-IT trial evaluated a highly purified EPA preparation at a high dose of 4 g/day in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and high cardiovascular risk, and demonstrated an extraordinary outcome of 25% relative reduction in cardiovascular events. This article reviews studies on omega-3 fatty acids during the last 50 years, including the progress in elucidating molecular mechanisms and recent large-scale clinical studies.",Watanabe Y; Tatsuno I,Journal of atherosclerosis and thrombosis,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31582621/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31577913,"Imaging inflammation and its resolution in health and disease: current status, clinical needs, challenges, and opportunities.","Inflammation is a normal process in our body; acute inflammation acts to suppress infections and support wound healing. Chronic inflammation likely leads to a wide range of diseases, including cancer. Tools to locate and monitor inflammation are critical for developing effective interventions to arrest inflammation and promote its resolution. To identify current clinical needs, challenges, and opportunities in advancing imaging-based evaluations of inflammatory status in patients, the U.S. National Institutes of Health convened a workshop on imaging inflammation and its resolution in health and disease. Clinical speakers described their needs for image-based capabilities that could help determine the extent of inflammatory conditions in patients to guide treatment planning and undertake necessary interventions. The imaging speakers showcased the state-of-the-art <i>in vivo</i> imaging techniques for detecting inflammation in different disease areas. Many imaging capabilities developed for 1 organ or disease can be adapted for other diseases and organs, whereas some have promise for clinical utility within the next 5-10 yr. Several speakers demonstrated that multimodal imaging measurements integrated with serum-based measures could improve in robustness for clinical utility. All speakers agreed that multiple inflammatory measures should be acquired longitudinally to comprehend the dynamics of unresolved inflammation that leads to disease development. They also agreed that the best strategies for accelerating clinical translation of imaging inflammation capabilities are through integration between new imaging techniques and biofluid-based biomarkers of inflammation as well as already established imaging measurements.-Liu, C.

31574903,Health-Promoting Properties of Selected Cyclitols for Metabolic Syndrome and Diabetes.,"Cyclitols play a particularly important role in cell functioning because they are involved in ion channel physiology, phosphate storage, signal transduction, cell wall formation, membrane biogenesis, osmoregulation and they have antioxidant activity. They are involved in the cell membranes as a phosphatidyl <i>myo-</i>inositol, an inositol triphosphate precursor, which acts as a transmitter that regulates the activity of several hormones, such as follicle-stimulating hormone, thyrotropin, and insulin. The aim of this paper is to characterize the selected cyclitols: <i>myo</i>-inositol, D-<i>chiro</i>-inositol, and D-pinitol in type-2 metabolic syndrome and diabetes treatment. Results and discussion: Cyclitols have certain clinical applications in the treatment of metabolic syndromes and are considered to be an option as a dietary supplement for the treatment or prevention of gestational diabetes mellitus and type-2 diabetes. Improved metabolic parameters observed after using cyclitols, like <i>myo</i>-inositol, in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome and type-2 diabetes suggest that they may have a protective effect on the cardiovascular system. Pinitol, together with <i>myo-</i>inositol,maybe responsible for improving lipid profiles by reducing serum triglyceride and total cholesterol. Pinitol is also well-researched and documented for insulin-like effects. <i>Myo-</i>inositol, D<i>-chiro</i>-inositol, and D-pinitol indicate a number of therapeutic and health-promoting properties.",Antonowski T; Osowski A; Lahuta L; Górecki R; Rynkiewicz A; Wojtkiewicz J,Nutrients,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31574903/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31573736,A systematic review on the mechanisms of vitamin K effects on the complications of diabetes and pre-diabetes.,"Diabetes mellitus and pre-diabetes are prevalent endocrine disorders associated with substantial morbidity and premature mortality. Vitamin K is known to have several beneficial effects on complications of diabetes and pre-diabetes. However, systematic consolidation of evidence is required to quantify these effects in order to inform clinical practice and research. A systematic search in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, ProQuest, and Google Scholar databases was undertaken from database inception up to October 2018 to evaluate functional roles of different forms of vitamin K on diabetes and pre-diabetes. From 3,734 identified records, nine articles met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated. Vitamin K supplementation was found to be associated with significant reductions in blood glucose (six studies), increased fasting serum insulin (four studies), reduced hemoglobin A1c (three studies), reduced homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) (two studies), and increased ß-cell function (two studies) in diabetic animal studies. Following 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test, vitamin K supplementation was observed to be effective in reducing blood glucose and insulin levels in the pre-diabetic population. However, no evidence of effect was observed for fasting blood sugar, insulin, HOMA-IR, and homeostatic model assessment-β-cell function index (two studies). A statistically significant effect was also noted with vitamin K in improving dyslipidemia (three studies) as well as oxidative stress and inflammatory markers (five studies) in diabetic animals. In conclusion, clinical trials and animal studies confirm that vitamin K supplementation may improve both clinical features and complications of diabetes and pre-diabetes. However, quantification of clinical efficacy in the pre-diabetic population and among individuals with comorbidities requires further investigation.",Karamzad N; Maleki V; Carson-Chahhoud K; Azizi S; Sahebkar A; Gargari BP,"BioFactors (Oxford, England)",2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31573736/,0,1,0,0,0,0
31561520,Ketogenic Diets and Exercise Performance.,"The ketogenic diet (KD) has gained a resurgence in popularity due to its purported reputation for fighting obesity. The KD has also acquired attention as an alternative and/or supplemental method for producing energy in the form of ketone bodies. Recent scientific evidence highlights the KD as a promising strategy to treat obesity, diabetes, and cardiac dysfunction. In addition, studies support ketone body supplements as a potential method to induce ketosis and supply sustainable fuel sources to promote exercise performance. Despite the acceptance in the mainstream media, the KD remains controversial in the medical and scientific communities. Research suggests that the KD or ketone body supplementation may result in unexpected side effects, including altered blood lipid profiles, abnormal glucose homeostasis, increased adiposity, fatigue, and gastrointestinal distress. The purpose of this review article is to provide an overview of ketone body metabolism and a background on the KD and ketone body supplements in the context of obesity and exercise performance. The effectiveness of these dietary or supplementation strategies as a therapy for weight loss or as an ergogenic aid will be discussed. In addition, the recent evidence that indicates ketone body metabolism is a potential target for cardiac dysfunction will be reviewed.",Harvey KL; Holcomb LE; Kolwicz SC,Nutrients,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31561520/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31547601,A Novel Anti-Inflammatory Role of Omega-3 PUFAs in Prevention and Treatment of Atherosclerosis and Vascular Cognitive Impairment and Dementia.,"Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory chronic disease affecting arterial vessels and leading to vascular diseases, such as stroke and myocardial infarction. The relationship between atherosclerosis and risk of neurodegeneration has been established, in particular with vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Systemic atherosclerosis increases the risk of VCID by inducing cerebral infarction, or through systemic or local inflammatory factors that underlie both atherosclerosis and cognition. Omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are involved in inflammatory processes, but with opposite roles. Specifically, omega-3 PUFAs exert anti-inflammatory properties by competing with omega-6 PUFAs and displacing arachidonic acid in membrane phospholipids, decreasing the production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. Experimental studies and some clinical trials have demonstrated that omega-3 PUFA supplementation may reduce the risk of different phenotypes of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. This review describes the link between atherosclerosis, VCID and inflammation, as well as how omega-3 PUFA supplementation may be useful to prevent and treat inflammatory-related diseases.",Simonetto M; Infante M; Sacco RL; Rundek T; Della-Morte D,Nutrients,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31547601/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31544699,Prevention of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) and Probiotics: Mechanism of Action: A Review.,"Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is a health problem that is increasing around the world. Prevention of GDM, rather than treatment, could have several benefits in terms of both health and economic cost. Even a slight reduction in maternal glucose in non-diabetic women, particularly in women at high risk for GDM, may have significant benefits for pregnancy results and the future health of off-springs. Probiotics are a relatively new intervention, which are assessed by mothers' metabolism, and can reduce blood sugar levels, prevent gestational diabetes and reduce the maternal and fetal complications resulting from it. The aim of this study was to review the studies on the prevention of gestational diabetes and assess the potential beneficial effects of probiotics on gestational diabetes and their possible mechanism of action. Articles compiled through clinical trials indexed in PubMed, Science Direct, Cochran, and Medlib between 2000 and 2017, with the keywords probiotics, prevention, and gestational diabetes mellitus were selected. Considering the potential of probiotics in the modulation of gut microbiota, naturalization increases intestinal permeability, regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators' secretion and thereby controlling local and systemic inflammation results in decreasing intestinal permeability, enhancing the immune system. It likely has the ability to prevent or control diabetes during pregnancy although confirmatory studies are still needed. Experimental and clinical evidence support the supposition that the modulation of the gut microbiota via probiotic microorganisms could be effective in the prevention of gestational diabetes mellitus.",Homayouni A; Bagheri N; Mohammad-Alizadeh-Charandabi S; Kashani N; Mobaraki-Asl N; Mirghafurvand M; Asgharian H; Ansari F; Pourjafar H,Current diabetes reviews,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31544699/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31540254,Nutraceutical Supplements in the Thyroid Setting: Health Benefits beyond Basic Nutrition.,"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in nutraceuticals, which may be considered as an efficient, preventive, and therapeutic tool in facing different pathological conditions, including thyroid diseases. Although iodine remains the major nutrient required for the functioning of the thyroid gland, other dietary components play important roles in clinical thyroidology-these include selenium, l-carnitine, myo-inositol, melatonin, and resveratrol-some of which have antioxidant properties. The main concern regarding the appropriate and effective use of nutraceuticals in prevention and treatment is due to the lack of clinical data supporting their efficacy. Another limitation is the discrepancy between the concentration claimed by the label and the real concentration. This paper provides a detailed critical review on the health benefits, beyond basic nutrition, of some popular nutraceutical supplements, with a special focus on their effects on thyroid pathophysiology and aims to distinguish between the truths and myths surrounding the clinical use of such nutraceuticals.",Benvenga S; Feldt-Rasmussen U; Bonofiglio D; Asamoah E,Nutrients,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31540254/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31534973,Effect of Inulin-Type Carbohydrates on Insulin Resistance in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Obesity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Insulin resistance (IR) is a physiological condition related to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity, which is associated with high blood insulin and glucose. Inulin-type carbohydrate (ITC) is a kind of fermentable fructan that can reduce glucose and ameliorate IR in an animal model, but the effect in clinical trials is controversial. The authors conducted a systematic literature review to evaluate the effect of ITC supplementation in ameliorating IR in T2DM and obese patients. Multiple databases were queried for studies before December 25, 2018, which involved supplementation with ITC in ameliorating IR in T2DM and obese patients. Studies that involved meta-analysis of the body mass index (BMI), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting insulin (FI), HbA1c, homeostatic model assessment IR (HOMA-IR), and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) of T2DM subjects were included. HOMA-IR and QUICKI were identified as the primary outcomes. A systematic review was performed to evaluate the effect of ITC on IR in obese patients. The database search yielded 25 studies, which met the inclusion criteria; 11 articles were meta-analyzed, and 5 other articles on T2DM and 9 articles on simple obesity were systematically reviewed. Our results did not find ITC supplementation decrease postintervention and reduction data of BMI (<i>P</i> = 0.08). However, it can significantly decrease postintervention and reduction data of FPG, FI, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR. Heterogeneity was eliminated by subgroup analysis according to baseline BMI. There was no significant difference in the amelioration of QUICKI between the ITC and control groups. However, the difference was statistically significant and the heterogeneity was eliminated after subgroup analysis according to intakes of ITC. 14 articles for a systematic review found that the results of blood glucose, insulin, and HbA1c were controversial. Only one of the seven studies on simple obesity concluded that ITC intervention significantly ameliorated HOMA-IR, while the other six did not. Supplementation of ITC can ameliorate IR in T2DM, especially in obese T2DM patients, but the effects are controversial in obese patients.",Rao M; Gao C; Xu L; Jiang L; Zhu J; Chen G; Law BYK; Xu Y,Journal of diabetes research,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31534973/,0,1,0,1,0,0
31532492,Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid oral supplements for improving peripheral nerve health: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Peripheral nerve damage can occur in a variety of systemic conditions and can have a profound impact on functional and psychological health. Currently, therapeutic interventions for peripheral nerve damage are limited. The aim of this systematic review, conducted in accordance with the Cochrane Collaboration's handbook and reported according to the PRISMA checklist, was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of omega-3 oral supplements for improving peripheral nerve structure and function. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases, along with clinical trial registries, were searched from inception to February 2019. Evidence was identified, critically appraised, and synthesized, and the certainty of evidence was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of omega-3 oral supplementation on outcomes of peripheral nerve structure, peripheral nerve function, or both were eligible for inclusion. Titles and abstracts of identified articles were independently assessed for potential eligibility by 2 review authors. For studies judged as eligible or potentially eligible, full text articles were retrieved and independently assessed by 2 review authors to determine eligibility; disagreements were resolved by consensus. Fifteen trials were included. Two clinically similar studies that investigated the effect of omega-3 supplementation in individuals receiving chemotherapy were meta-analyzed. Pooled data showed a reduced incidence of peripheral neuropathy (RR = 0.58; 95%CI, 0.43-0.77) and a preservation of sensory nerve action potential amplitudes with omega-3 supplementation compared with placebo (MD = 4.19 µV; 95%CI; 2.19-6.19). This review finds, with low certainty, that omega-3 supplementation attenuates sensory loss and reduces the incidence of neuropathy secondary to oxaliplatin and paclitaxel treatment relative to placebo. There is currently limited evidence to ascertain whether omega-3 supplementation is beneficial in other systemic conditions characterized by peripheral nerve damage.

31527297,Non-pharmacological management of gestational diabetes: The role of myo-inositol.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the most common metabolic disorder occurring in pregnancy. GDM plays an important role in the current diabetes epidemic: exposure to a high glycemic environment during the early stages of development increases the risk of the fetus to develop type two diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in adult life. Various cardiometabolic risk factors are linked to GDM. A thorough knowledge of the risk factors and genes involved in the development of GDM, along with an understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are crucial to properly identify patients at risk of developing this condition. There is growing evidence showing that myo-inositol, combined with an appropriate therapeutic regimen for GDM, can provide additional benefits to the patient. The aim of this review is to analyze the role of inositol isomers - especially myo-inositol (MYO-INS) - in the treatment of patients with GDM.",Guardo FD; Currò JM; Valenti G; Rossetti P; Di Gregorio LM; Conway F; Chiofalo B; Garzon S; Bruni S; Rizzo G,Journal of complementary & integrative medicine,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31527297/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched randomized controlled trials in PubMed and Scopus up to November 2018. The mean differences (MD) and confidence interval (CI) of CRP (mg/L) concentrations were pooled with a random- or a fixed-effects model depending on the results of heterogeneity tests. Of 1242 studies identified, 5 were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled analysis showed that serum levels of CRP were decreased after BER supplementation (MD:-0.64 mg/L, 95% CI(-0.67 to -0.61) P < 0.001)) without any significant heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 0.0% and P = 0.984). This meta-analysis showed BER supplementation may ameliorate the state of chronic inflammation. Patients with cardiovascular disease and diabetes are two important groups which may benefit from BER supplementation.

The PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials at the Cochrane Library), Web of Science, OVID, and www.clinicaltrials.gov (latest search: December 10, 2018) databases were searched. This study was limited to randomized controlled trials. Patients with diabetes and albuminuria were included regardless of diabetic type, and patients must have received treatment with vitamins C or E. Ten studies, representing 445 participants, were identified for analysis. Antioxidant vitamins had significant effects on serum creatinine levels (mean difference = -0.11 mg/dL, 95% confidence interval -0.19 to -0.03, P = .007) and systolic pressure (mean difference = -6.02 mm Hg, 95% confidence interval -9.65 to -2.40, P = .001) with low heterogeneity. Antioxidant vitamins had no effect on albuminuria or proteinuria, diastolic blood pressure, glucose, or lipid metabolism. This meta-analysis indicated that antioxidant vitamins can benefit kidney function and systolic blood pressure in patients with diabetes and albuminuria. Further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up are needed to completely understand the effect of antioxidant vitamins in these patients.",Chen J; Wu J; Kong D; Yang C; Yu H; Pan Q; Liu W; Ding Y; Liu H,Journal of renal nutrition : the official journal of the Council on Renal Nutrition of the National Kidney Foundation,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31466888/,0,0,0,1,0,1

31438829,A Systematic Review on Synthetic Drugs and Phytopharmaceuticals Used to Manage Diabetes.,"Diabetes is a multifactorial disease and a major cause for many microvascular and macrovascular complications. The disease will ultimately lead to high rate mortality if it is not managed properly. Treatment of diabetes without any side effects has always remained a major challenge for health care practitioners. The current review discusses the various conventional drugs, herbal drugs, combination therapy and the use of nutraceuticals for the effective management of diabetes mellitus. The biotechnological aspects of various antidiabetic drugs are also discussed. Structured search of bibliographic databases for previously published peer-reviewed research papers was explored and data was sorted in terms of various approaches that are used for the treatment of diabetes. More than 170 papers including both research and review articles, were included in this review in order to produce a comprehensive and easily understandable article. A series of herbal and synthetic drugs have been discussed along with their current status of treatment in terms of dose, mechanism of action and possible side effects. The article also focuses on combination therapies containing synthetic as well as herbal drugs to treat the disease. The role of pre and probiotics in the management of diabetes is also highlighted. Oral antihyperglycemics which are used to treat diabetes can cause many adverse effects and if given in combination, can lead to drug-drug interactions. The combination of various phytochemicals with synthetic drugs can overcome the challenge faced by the synthetic drug treatment.

31438826,Molecular Insights into the Mechanisms Underlying the Cholesterol- Lowering Effects of Phytosterols.,"Dietary phytosterols, which comprise plant sterols and stanols, reduce plasma Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (LDL-C) levels when given 2 g/day. Since this dose has not been reported to cause health-related side effects in long-term human studies, food products containing these plant compounds are used as potential therapeutic dietary options to reduce LDL-C and cardiovascular disease risk. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the cholesterol-lowering action of phytosterols. They may compete with dietary and biliary cholesterol for micellar solubilization in the intestinal lumen, impairing intestinal cholesterol absorption. Recent evidence indicates that phytosterols may also regulate other pathways. Impaired intestinal cholesterol absorption is usually associated with reduced cholesterol transport to the liver, which may reduce the incorporation of cholesterol into Very-Low- Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) particles, thereby lowering the rate of VLDL assembly and secretion. Impaired liver VLDL production may reduce the rate of LDL production. On the other hand, significant evidence supports a role for plant sterols in the Transintestinal Cholesterol Excretion (TICE) pathway, although the exact mechanisms by which they promote the flow of cholesterol from the blood to enterocytes and the intestinal lumen remains unknown. Dietary phytosterols may also alter the conversion of bile acids into secondary bile acids, and may lower the bile acid hydrophobic/hydrophilic ratio, thereby reducing intestinal cholesterol absorption. This article reviews the progress to date in research on the molecular mechanisms underlying the cholesterol-lowering effects of phytosterols.",Cedó L; Farràs M; Lee-Rueckert M; Escolà-Gil JC,Current medicinal chemistry,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31438826/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Funnel plots were examined and subgrouping assessed effects of intervention type, replacement, baseline risk of diabetes and use of antidiabetes drugs, trial duration, and dose. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane tool and quality of evidence with GRADE. 83 randomised controlled trials (mainly assessing effects of supplementary long chain omega-3) were included; 10 were at low summary risk of bias. Long chain omega-3 had little or no effect on likelihood of diagnosis of diabetes (relative risk 1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.17; 58 643 participants, 3.7% developed diabetes) or measures of glucose metabolism (HbA<sub>1c</sub> mean difference -0.02%, 95% confidence interval -0.07% to 0.04%; plasma glucose 0.04, 0.02 to 0.07, mmol/L; fasting insulin 1.02, -4.34 to 6.37, pmol/L; HOMA-IR 0.06, -0.21 to 0.33). A suggestion of negative outcomes was observed when dose of supplemental long chain omega-3 was above 4.4 g/d. Effects of α-linolenic acid, omega-6, and total PUFA on diagnosis of diabetes were unclear (as the evidence was of very low quality), but little or no effect on measures of glucose metabolism was seen, except that increasing α-linolenic acid may increase fasting insulin (by about 7%). No evidence was found that the omega-3/omega-6 ratio is important for diabetes or glucose metabolism. This is the most extensive systematic review of trials to date to assess effects of polyunsaturated fats on newly diagnosed diabetes and glucose metabolism, including previously unpublished data following contact with authors. Evidence suggests that increasing omega-3, omega-6, or total PUFA has little or no effect on prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

31426097,Dilemmas in Vitamin D Management in Children and Adolescents.,"The importance of vitamin D and its role in several biological processes has been a topic of interest in recent years. Vitamin D is an essential nutrient that is needed for metabolic bone health and for maintaining bone calcium homeostasis. It is primarily synthesized in the skin on exposure to sunlight. Of late, vitamin D deficiency has been associated with conditions such as obesity, poor control of asthma and other autoimmune diseases, which has led to questions about its potential role in causation and management of these conditions. Given the increase in data about this topic, providers may often have questions about whom to screen and what to tell patients. In this article, we address screening guidelines for vitamin D in children and adolescents, management of vitamin D deficiency, and current literature on the role of vitamin D in conditions such as obesity, asthma, and type 1 diabetes mellitus.

31425942,The effect of curcumin supplementation on circulating adiponectin: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Our objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of curcumin on serum adiponectin concentration. We searched PubMed/Medline, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google scholar databases up to April 2019. RCTs conducted among human adults studied the effects of curcumin on serum adiponectin concentrations as an outcome variable was included. The weighted mean differences (WMD) and standard deviations (SD) of change in serum adiponectin levels were calculated. The random effects model was used for deriving a summary of mean estimates with their corresponding SDs. Out of 313 records, 6 trials that enrolled 652 subjects were included. The pooled results showed that curcumin supplementation significantly increased adiponectin concentrations in comparison with placebo (WMD: 0.82 Hedges' g; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.33 to 1.30, P˂0.001). Greater effects on adiponectin were observed in trials lasting ≤10 weeks (WMD: 1.05 Hedges' g; 95% CI: 0.64 to 1.45, P˂0.001). Curcumin significantly improves adiponectin concentrations. However, due to some limitations in this study, further studies are needed to reach a definitive conclusion about the effect of curcumin on the levels of adiponectin.",Clark CCT; Ghaedi E; Arab A; Pourmasoumi M; Hadi A,Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31425942/,0,1,0,1,0,0

Therefore, we carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), to assess the effect of omega-3 and vitamin E co-supplementation on total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in patients with MS. A systematic search was performed to find the related articles, up to April, 2019. There was no language and time limitation. Meta-analyses were carried out using both the random and fixed effects model where appropriate, and I2 index was used to evaluate the heterogeneity. Search yielded 1236 publications. Five RCTs with 254 patients were eligible. Results of the meta-analysis indicated that omega-3 and vitamin E co-supplementation significantly reduced the serum concentrations of TG and LDL, whereas, it had no significant effect on the serum levels of TC and HDL in overweight patients with MS. Present systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that omega-3 and vitamin E co-supplementation have beneficial effects on lipid profile of overweight patients with MS. It significantly reduced the serum levels of TG and LDL in such patients.",Asbaghi O; Choghakhori R; Abbasnezhad A,Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31405672/,0,1,0,1,0,0
31400903,Is vitamin D-fortified yogurt a value-added strategy for improving human health? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials.,"Yogurt is a good source of probiotics, calcium, and proteins, but its content of vitamin D is low. Therefore, yogurt could be a good choice for vitamin D fortification to improve the positive health outcomes associated with its consumption. The primary aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the effect of vitamin D-fortified yogurt compared with plain yogurt on levels of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD). The secondary aim was to evaluate the effect of fortified yogurt on parathyroid hormone, anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, glucose metabolism, and lipid profile. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar for eligible studies; that is, randomized controlled trials (RCT) that compared vitamin D-fortified yogurt with control treatment without any additional supplement. Random-effects models were used to estimate pooled effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals. Findings from 9 RCT (n = 665 participants) that lasted from 8 to 16 wk are summarized in this review. The meta-analyzed mean differences for random effects showed that vitamin D-fortified yogurt (from 400 to 2,000 IU) increased serum 25OHD by 31.00 nmol/L. In addition, vitamin D-fortified yogurt decreased parathyroid hormone by 15.47 ng/L, body weight by 0.92 kg, waist circumference by 2.01 cm, HOMA-IR by 2.18 mass units, fasting serum glucose by 22.54 mg/dL, total cholesterol by 13.38 mg/dL, and triglycerides by 30.12 mg/dL compared with the controlled treatments. No publication bias was identified. Considerable between-study heterogeneity was observed for most outcomes. Vitamin D-fortified yogurt may be beneficial in improving serum 25OHD, lipid profile, glucose metabolism, and anthropometric parameters and decreasing parathyroid hormone level in pregnant women and adult and elderly subjects with or without diabetes, prediabetes, or metabolic syndrome.",Gasparri C; Perna S; Spadaccini D; Alalwan T; Girometta C; Infantino V; Rondanelli M,Journal of dairy science,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31400903/,0,1,0,1,0,0
31398841,Metabolic Effects of Resistant Starch Type 2: A Systematic Literature Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"Published evidence exploring the effects of dietary resistant starch (RS) on human cardiometabolic health is inconsistent. This review aimed to investigate the effect of dietary RS type 2 (RS2) supplementation on body weight, satiety ratings, fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin resistance and lipid levels in healthy individuals and those with overweight/obesity, the metabolic syndrome (MetS), prediabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Five electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English between 1982 and 2018, with trials eligible for inclusion if they reported RCTs involving humans where at least one group consumed ≥ 8 g of RS2 per day and measured body weight, satiety, glucose and/or lipid metabolic outcomes. Twenty-two RCTs involving 670 participants were included. Meta-analyses indicated that RS2 supplementation significantly reduced serum triacylglycerol concentrations (mean difference (MD) = -0.10 mmol/L; 95% CI -0.19, -0.01, <i>P</i> = 0.03) in healthy individuals (<i>n</i> = 269) and reduced body weight (MD = -1.29 kg; 95% CI -2.40, -0.17, <i>P</i> = 0.02) in people with T2DM (<i>n</i> = 90). However, these outcomes were heavily influenced by positive results from a small number of individual studies which contradicted the conclusions of the majority of trials. RS2 had no effects on any other metabolic outcomes. All studies ranged from 1-12 weeks in duration and contained small sample sizes (10-60 participants), and most had an unclear risk of bias. Short-term RS2 supplementation in humans is of limited cardiometabolic benefit.",Snelson M; Jong J; Manolas D; Kok S; Louise A; Stern R; Kellow NJ,Nutrients,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31398841/,0,1,0,1,0,0
31372708,Oral vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation increases serum fibroblast growth factor 23 concentration in vitamin D-deficient patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Studies have suggested that vitamin D supplementation may increase serum fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) among vitamin D-deficient patients although the results were inconsistent across the studies. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to summarize all available data. A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE and EMBASE database from inception to February 2019 to identify studies that provided oral vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplement to vitamin D-deficient participants (25-hydroxyvitamin D < 20 ng/mL). Mean serum FGF23 concentration and standard deviation of participants at baseline and after vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation were extracted to calculate standard mean difference (SMD). Pooled SMD was calculated by combining SMDs of each study using random effects model. Nine studies were eligible for the meta-analyses. Seven studies measured serum intact FGF23, and two studies measured serum C-terminal FGF23. The meta-analyses found that serum intact FGF23 increased significantly after oral vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation in vitamin D-deficient participants with the pooled SMD of 0.36 (95%CI, 0.14, 0.57; p = 0.001; I<sup>2</sup> of 36%). Serum C-terminal FGF23 also increased after vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation in vitamin D-deficient participants with the pooled SMD of 0.28 although without reaching statistical significance (95%CI, - 0.08, 0.65; p = 0.13; I<sup>2</sup> of 0%). Funnel plot of the meta-analysis of serum intact FGF23 did not provide a suggestive evidence for publication bias. Vitamin D supplementation leads to a significant increase in serum intact FGF23 among vitamin D-deficient patients. An increase in serum C-terminal FGF23 was also observed although the number of included studies was too small to demonstrate statistical significance. The present systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that serum intact FGF23 concentration increased significantly after oral vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation in vitamin D-deficient participants. An increase in serum C-terminal FGF23 concentration was also observed although the number of included studies was too small to demonstrate statistical significance.",Charoenngam N; Rujirachun P; Holick MF; Ungprasert P,Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31372708/,0,1,0,1,0,0
31368026,Nutritional Supplementation for the Prevention and/or Treatment of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common pregnancy complication that has short- and long-term health implications for both the mother and child. While lifestyle modifications, insulin therapy, and oral agents such as metformin are effective, they can be difficult to adhere to, and there remain concerns over long-term effects of oral agents on the infant. Further, GDM has no proven preventive strategies, which could be more effective than treatment postdiagnosis. Nutritional supplements are an appealing, potentially safer, and better tolerated alternative to pharmaceuticals to treat and/or prevent GDM. Here, we review the existing evidence for nutritional supplementation for treatment and prevention of GDM. There is limited evidence that myo-inositol, vitamins D and B6, magnesium, selenium, zinc, fatty acids, and probiotics might be beneficial for the prevention or treatment of GDM. There are very few studies for each nutrient, and the existing studies tend to have few participants. Where multiple studies of a nutrient exist, often those studies were conducted within the same country, limiting the generalizability of the findings, or alternatively there was no consensus across findings. There is limited evidence that nutritional supplementation of myo-inositol, vitamins D and B6, magnesium, selenium, zinc, fatty acids, and probiotics could improve glycemic control or prevent GDM. Our understanding is constrained by the small number of studies, small sample sizes in most studies, and by lack of consistency across findings. Further large, high-quality, randomized controlled trials are required to determine the efficacy of nutritional supplements to treat or prevent GDM.",Plows JF; Reynolds CM; Vickers MH; Baker PN; Stanley JL,Current diabetes reports,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31368026/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31351526,Effects of phytochemicals against diabetes.,"Diabetes mellitus, a chronic metabolic disease, characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose and insufficiency in production and action of insulin is the seventh leading cause of death worldwide. Numerous studies have shown that diabetes mellitus is associated with increased formation of free radicals and decrease in antioxidant potential. In the patients with diabetes mellitus, the levels of antioxidant parameters are found to decrease, hence in many studies phytochemicals which can exert antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities, are suggested to improve the insulin sensitivity. Several phytoactive compounds such as flavonoids, lignans, prophenylphenols, are also found to combat the complications of diabetes. This chapter mainly focuses on the relationship between diabetes mellitus and preventive roles of various phytochemicals on diabetes via their antioxidant properties.",Bacanli M; Dilsiz SA; Başaran N; Başaran AA,Advances in food and nutrition research,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31351526/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31349946,Vitamin C for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension.,"It is suggested that supplementation of vitamin C reduces hyperglycemia and lowers blood pressure in hypertensives by enhacing the formation of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), PGI2 (prostacyclin), endothelial nitric oxide (eNO), and restore essential fatty acid (EFA) metabolism to normal and enhance the formation of lipoxin A4 (LXA4), a potent anti-inflammatory, vasodilator and antioxidant. These actions are in addition to the ability of vitamin C to function as an antioxidant. In vitro and in vivo studies revealed that PGE1, PGI2 and NO have cytoprotective and genoprotective actions and thus, protect pancreatic β and vascular endotheilial cells from the cytotoxic actions of endogenous and exogenous toxins. AA, the precursor of LXA4 and LXA4 have potent anti-diabetic actions and their plasma tissue concentrations are decreased in those with diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Thus, vitamin C by augmenting the formation of PGE1, PGI2, eNO, LXA4 and restoring AA content to normal may function as a cytoprotective, anti-mutagenic, vasodilator and platelet anti-agregator actions that explains its benefical action in type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension.",Das UN,Archives of medical research,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31349946/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31348529,Vitamin D supplementation for women during pregnancy.,"Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy may be needed to protect against adverse pregnancy outcomes. This is an update of a review that was first published in 2012 and then in 2016. To examine whether vitamin D supplementation alone or in combination with calcium or other vitamins and minerals given to women during pregnancy can safely improve maternal and neonatal outcomes. For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (12 July 2018), contacted relevant organisations (15 May 2018), reference lists of retrieved trials and registries at clinicaltrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (12 July 2018). Abstracts were included if they had enough information to extract the data. Randomised and quasi-randomised trials evaluating the effect of supplementation with vitamin D alone or in combination with other micronutrients for women during pregnancy in comparison to placebo or no intervention. Two review authors independently i) assessed the eligibility of trials against the inclusion criteria, ii) extracted data from included trials, and iii) assessed the risk of bias of the included trials. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. We included 30 trials (7033 women), excluded 60 trials, identified six as ongoing/unpublished trials and two trials are awaiting assessments.Supplementation with vitamin D alone versus placebo/no interventionA total of 22 trials involving 3725 pregnant women were included in this comparison; 19 trials were assessed as having low-to-moderate risk of bias for most domains and three trials were assessed as having high risk of bias for most domains. Supplementation with vitamin D alone during pregnancy probably reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia (risk ratio (RR) 0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 0.79; 4 trials, 499 women, moderate-certainty evidence) and gestational diabetes (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; 4 trials, 446 women, moderate-certainty evidence); and probably reduces the risk of having a baby with low birthweight (less than 2500 g) (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.87; 5 trials, 697 women, moderate-certainty evidence) compared to women who received placebo or no intervention. Vitamin D supplementation may make little or no difference in the risk of having a preterm birth < 37 weeks compared to no intervention or placebo (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.30; 7 trials, 1640 women, low-certainty evidence). In terms of maternal adverse events, vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of severe postpartum haemorrhage (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.91; 1 trial, 1134 women, low-certainty evidence). There were no cases of hypercalcaemia (1 trial, 1134 women, low-certainty evidence), and we are very uncertain as to whether vitamin D increases or decreases the risk of nephritic syndrome (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.06; 1 trial, 135 women, very low-certainty evidence). However, given the scarcity of data in general for maternal adverse events, no firm conclusions can be drawn.Supplementation with vitamin D and calcium versus placebo/no interventionNine trials involving 1916 pregnant women were included in this comparison; three trials were assessed as having low risk of bias for allocation and blinding, four trials were assessed as having high risk of bias and two had some components having a low risk, high risk, or unclear risk. Supplementation with vitamin D and calcium during pregnancy probably reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.78; 4 trials, 1174 women, moderate-certainty evidence). The effect of the intervention is uncertain on gestational diabetes (RR 0.33,% CI 0.01 to 7.84; 1 trial, 54 women, very low-certainty evidence); and low birthweight (less than 2500 g) (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.10 to 4.55; 2 trials, 110 women, very low-certainty evidence) compared to women who received placebo or no intervention. Supplementation with vitamin D and calcium during pregnancy may increase the risk of preterm birth < 37 weeks in comparison to women who received placebo or no intervention (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.28; 5 trials, 942 women, low-certainty evidence). No trial in this comparison reported on maternal adverse events.Supplementation with vitamin D + calcium + other vitamins and minerals versus calcium + other vitamins and minerals (but no vitamin D)One trial in 1300 participants was included in this comparison; it was assessed as having low risk of bias. Pre-eclampsia was not assessed. Supplementation with vitamin D + other nutrients may make little or no difference in the risk of preterm birth < 37 weeks (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.59; 1 trial, 1298 women, low-certainty evidence); or low birthweight (less than 2500 g) (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.51; 1 trial, 1298 women, low-certainty evidence). It is unclear whether it makes any difference to the risk of gestational diabetes (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.73) or maternal adverse events (hypercalcaemia no events; hypercalciuria RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.02 to 3.97; 1 trial, 1298 women,) because the certainty of the evidence for both outcomes was found to be very low. We included 30 trials (7033 women) across three separate comparisons. Our GRADE assessments ranged from moderate to very low, with downgrading decisions based on limitations in study design, imprecision and indirectness.Supplementing pregnant women with vitamin D alone probably reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, low birthweight and may reduce the risk of severe postpartum haemorrhage. It may make little or no difference in the risk of having a preterm birth < 37 weeks' gestation. Supplementing pregnant women with vitamin D and calcium probably reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia but may increase the risk of preterm births < 37 weeks (these findings warrant further research). Supplementing pregnant women with vitamin D and other nutrients may make little or no difference in the risk of preterm birth < 37 weeks' gestation or low birthweight (less than 2500 g). Additional rigorous high quality and larger randomised trials are required to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy, particularly in relation to the risk of maternal adverse events.",Palacios C; Kostiuk LK; Peña-Rosas JP,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31348529/,0,1,0,0,0,0

31344283,L-serine: a neglected amino acid with a potential therapeutic role in diabetes.,"L-serine is classified as a non-essential amino acid; however, L-serine is indispensable having a central role in a broad range of cellular processes. Growing evidence suggests a role for L-serine in the development of diabetes mellitus and its related complications, with L-serine being positively correlated to insulin secretion and sensitivity. L-serine metabolism is altered in type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes, and L-serine supplementations improve glucose homeostasis and mitochondrial function, and reduce neuronal death. Additionally, L-serine lowers the incidence of autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice. Dietary supplementations of L-serine are generally regarded as safe (GRAS) by the FDA. Therefore, we believe that L-serine should be considered as an emerging therapeutic option in diabetes, although work remains in order to fully understand the role of L-serine in diabetes.",Holm LJ; Buschard K,"APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica",2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31344283/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31337059,Anti-Diabetic Effects and Mechanisms of Dietary Polysaccharides.,"Diabetes mellitus is a multifactorial, heterogeneous metabolic disorder, causing various health complications and economic issues, which apparently impacts the human's life. Currently, commercial diabetic drugs are clinically managed for diabetic treatment that has definite side effects. Dietary polysaccharides mainly derive from natural sources, including medicinal plants, grains, fruits, vegetables, edible mushroom, and medicinal foods, and possess anti-diabetic potential. Hence, this review summarizes the effects of dietary polysaccharides on diabetes and underlying molecular mechanisms related to inflammatory factors, oxidative stress, and diabetes in various animal models. The analysis of literature and appropriate data on anti-diabetic polysaccharide from electronic databases was conducted. In vivo and in vitro trials have revealed that treatment of these polysaccharides has hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects, which enhance pancreatic <i>β</i>-cell mass and alleviates <i>β</i>-cell dysfunction. It enhances insulin signaling pathways through insulin receptors and activates the PI3K/Akt pathway, and eventually modulates ERK/JNK/MAPK pathway. In conclusion, dietary polysaccharides can effectively ameliorate hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, low-grade inflammation, and oxidative stress in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and, thus, consumption of polysaccharides can be a valuable choice for diabetic control.",Ganesan K; Xu B,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31337059/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31336965,Natural Hydrogen Sulfide Donors from <i>Allium</i> sp. as a Nutraceutical Approach in Type 2 Diabetes Prevention and Therapy.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is a socially relevant chronic disease with high prevalence worldwide. DM may lead to several vascular, macrovascular, and microvascular complications (cerebrovascular, coronary artery, and peripheral arterial diseases, retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy), often accelerating the progression of atherosclerosis. Dietary therapy is generally considered to be the first step in the treatment of diabetic patients. Among the current therapeutic options, such as insulin therapy and hypoglycemic drugs, in recent years, attention has been shifting to the effects and properties-that are still not completely known-of medicinal plants as valid and inexpensive therapeutic supports with limited side effects. In this review, we report the relevant effects of medicinal plants and nutraceuticals in diabetes. In particular, we paid attention to the organosulfur compounds (OSCs) present in plant extracts that due to their antioxidant, hypoglycemic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects, can contribute as cardioprotective agents in type 2 DM. OSCs derived from garlic (<i>Allium</i> sp.), due to their properties, can represent a valuable support to the diet in type 2 DM, as outlined in this manuscript based on both in vitro and in vivo studies. Moreover, a relevant characteristic of garlic OSCs is their ability to produce the gasotransmitter H<sub>2</sub>S, and many of their effects can be explained by this property. Indeed, in recent years, several studies have demonstrated the relevant effects of endogenous and exogenous H<sub>2</sub>S in human DM, including by in vitro and in vivo experiments and clinical trials; therefore, here, we summarize the effects and the underlying molecular mechanisms of H<sub>2</sub>S and natural H<sub>2</sub>S donors.",Melino S; Leo S; Toska Papajani V,Nutrients,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31336965/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31336940,Is Vitamin D Supplementation Useful for Weight Loss Programs? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"<i>Background and Objectives:</i> The controversy about the impact of vitamin D supplementation on weight loss treatment was observed in several randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This meta-analysis investigates the effects of vitamin D supplementation (cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) on weight loss through holistic measurements of Body Mass Index (BMI), weight and waist circumference. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> Google Scholar, WOS, PubMed and Scopus were explored to collect relevant studies. The selected articles focused on vitamin D supplementation in overweight and obese individuals with different conditions. Eleven RCTs were included into this meta-analysis with a total of 947 subjects, with a mean of the follow-up from 1 to 12 months and different vitamin D interventions (from 25,000 to 600,000 IU/monthly of cholecalciferol). <i>Results:</i> The meta-analyzed mean differences for random effects showed that cholecalciferol supplementation deceases the BMI by -0.32 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (CI95% -0.52, -0.12 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <i>p</i> = 0.002) and the waist circumference by -1.42 cm (CI95% -2.41, -0.42 cm, <i>p</i> = 0.005), but does not statistically affect weight loss -0.43 kg (CI95% -1.05, +0.19 kg, <i>p</i> = 0.17). <i>Conclusions:</i> This meta-analysis lays the foundation for defining the potential clinical efficacy of vitamin D supplementation as a potential therapeutic option for weight loss programs, but further studies are needed to confirm the validity of these findings and delineate potential underlying mechanisms.",Perna S,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31336940/,0,1,0,1,0,1
31336536,Effect of omega-3 fatty acid plus vitamin E Co-Supplementation on lipid profile: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Dyslipidemia is linked to chronic inflammation, which in return leads to a set of chronic disorders. Omega-3 fatty acids have been reported to reduce inflammation. Furthermore, Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin which has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Vitamin E and omega-3 fatty acids co-supplementations may be more effective than the single supplementation in control dyslipidemia. Therefore, we designed and conducted the current systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effect of co-supplementation of vitamin E and omega-3 fatty acids on the lipid profile. A comprehensive search for studies published between January 1990 and July 2018 was performed. The initial search extracted 3015 potentially relevant articles. After studying these publications, 9 RCTs were potentially eligible and retrieved in full text. The meta-analysis indicate that on total cholesterol, HDL, LDL and triglyceride individually did not show any significant difference between intervention and control groups, but vitamin E an omega-3 fatty acids co-supplementations significantly reduce VLDL levels.

31332821,The effect of vitamin D supplementation on the androgenic profile in men: A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials.,"The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on total testosterone (TT) and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in men. We searched PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science for randomized, controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation in men ≥18 years old up to September 2018, without language restrictions. Meta-analysis was based on a random effects model. The systematic review was registered as CRD42018094498. We identified 3,402 articles, of which eight studies with 10 effect sizes met the inclusion criteria. Vitamin D daily dose equivalents ranged from 600 to 4,000 per day to 60,000 IU per week; duration was 6 weeks to 36 months. In general, vitamin D supplementation had no significant effect on TT (MD = 0.20, 95% CI: -0.20, 0.60, p = 0.336) and SHBG (MD = 1.56, 95% CI: -0.85, 3.97, p = 0.204). Subgroup analysis conducted with duration of prescription, type (daily or weekly), dosing frequency and baseline vitamin D and TT concentration showed that vitamin D did not significantly affect TT. The present study did not find any evidence to support beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation on TT and SHBG in men. Thus, further large-scale randomised controlled trials are required to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on androgen in men.",Hosseini Marnani E; Mollahosseini M; Gheflati A; Ghadiri-Anari A; Nadjarzadeh A,Andrologia,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31332821/,0,1,0,1,0,0
31315213,Nutraceutical Potential of <i>Carica papaya</i> in Metabolic Syndrome.,"<i>Carica papaya</i> L. is a well-known fruit worldwide, and its highest production occurs in tropical and subtropical regions. The pulp contains vitamins A, C, and E, B complex vitamins, such as pantothenic acid and folate, and minerals, such as magnesium and potassium, as well as food fibers. Phenolic compounds, such as benzyl isothiocyanate, glucosinolates, tocopherols (α and δ), β-cryptoxanthin, β-carotene and carotenoids, are found in the seeds. The oil extracted from the seed principally presents oleic fatty acid followed by palmitic, linoleic and stearic acids, whereas the leaves have high contents of food fibers and polyphenolic compounds, flavonoids, saponins, pro-anthocyanins, tocopherol, and benzyl isothiocyanate. Studies demonstrated that the nutrients present in its composition have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, protecting it against cardiovascular illnesses and preventing harm caused by free radicals. It has also been reported that it aids in the treatment of diabetes mellitus and in the reduction of cholesterol levels. Thus, both the pulp and the other parts of the plant (leaves and seeds) present antioxidant, anti-hypertensive, hypoglycemic, and hypolipidemic actions, which, in turn, can contribute to the prevention and treatment of obesity and associated metabolic disorders.",Santana LF; Inada AC; Espirito Santo BLSD; Filiú WFO; Pott A; Alves FM; Guimarães RCA; Freitas KC; Hiane PA,Nutrients,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31315213/,1,0,0,0,0,0

31292599,Effect of low-ratio n-6/n-3 PUFA on blood glucose: a meta-analysis.,"The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the effect of increasing dietary low-ratio n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intake on blood glucose and other related indicators. We systematically searched randomized controlled trials of low-ratio n-6/n-3 PUFA intervention on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library and related references up to August 2018. The change values were calculated as the weighted mean difference (WMD) by using a random-effect model. Eleven randomized controlled trials were included. No significant effect of dietary low-ratio n-6/n-3 PUFA supplementation was observed on fasting blood glucose (WMD: 0.057 mmol L<sup>-1</sup>; 95% CI: -0.090 to 0.204 mmol L<sup>-1</sup>), insulin (WMD: -0.757 mIU L<sup>-1</sup>; 95% CI: -2.419 to 0.904 mIU L<sup>-1</sup>), insulin resistance index (WMD: -0.201; 95% CI: -0.566 to 0.165), and glycosylated hemoglobin (WMD: -0.063%; 95% CI: -0.061 to 0.186%). Subgroup analysis showed that the effect of low-ratio n-6/n-3 PUFA on the reduction of the plasma insulin level in North America (WMD: -3.473 mIU L<sup>-1</sup>; 95% CI: -5.760 to -1.185 mIU L<sup>-1</sup>) was more obvious than that in Asian countries (WMD: -0.797 mIU L<sup>-1</sup>; 95% CI: -2.497 to 0.902 mIU L<sup>-1</sup>) and European countries (WMD: -0.063 mIU L<sup>-1</sup>; 95% CI: -0.061 to 0.186 mIU L<sup>-1</sup>). In the subgroup of diabetic subjects, low-ratio n-6/n-3 PUFA supplementation can decrease the plasma insulin level (WMD: -3.010 mIU L<sup>-1</sup>; 95% CI: -5.371 to -0.648 mIU L<sup>-1</sup>) and insulin resistance index (WMD: -0.460; 95% CI: -0.908 to -0.012). When the intervention period was longer than 8 weeks, low-ratio n-6/n-3 PUFA supplementation could also decrease the plasma insulin level (WMD: -2.782 mIU L<sup>-1</sup>; 95% CI: -4.946 to -0.618 mIU L<sup>-1</sup>). No significant publication bias was observed for all blood glucose and other related indicators as suggested by Begg's test and Egger's test. Our meta-analysis found that low-ratio n-6/n-3 PUFA supplementation could improve the glucose metabolism by reducing the insulin and insulin resistance in the diabetic patients. Low-ratio n-6/n-3 PUFA supplementation could reduce the plasma insulin level when the supplementation duration was longer than 8 weeks.",Li N; Yue H; Jia M; Liu W; Qiu B; Hou H; Huang F; Xu T,Food & function,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31292599/,0,1,0,1,0,0
31267861,Prophylaxis of Non-communicable Diseases: Why Fruits and Vegetables may be Better Chemopreventive Agents than Dietary Supplements Based on Isolated Phytochemicals?,"The World Health Organization (WHO) report from 2014 documented that non-communicable socalled civilization diseases such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer or type 2 diabetes are responsible for over 50% of all premature deaths in the world. Research carried out over the past 20 years has provided data suggesting that diet is an essential factor influencing the risk of development of these diseases. The increasing knowledge on chemopreventive properties of certain food ingredients, in particular, those of plant origin, opened the discussion on the possibility to use edible plants or their active components in the prevention of these chronic diseases. Health-promoting properties of plant foods are associated with the presence of secondary metabolites that can affect many biological mechanisms of critical importance to the proper functioning of the human organism. Particularly, there have been numerous investigations indicating strong physiological effects of bioactive plant phenols belonging to the flavonoid family. These observations initiated mass production of dietary supplements containing flavonoids commercialized under the name antioxidants, even if their chemical properties did not justify such a term. However, epidemiological studies revealed that isolated bioactive phytochemicals are not as effective as fruits and vegetables containing these substances whereas they are of interest of the functional food industry. In this paper, the critical assessment of reasons for this turn of events has been attempted and the concept of food synergy has been suggested as a future strategy of dietary chemoprevention.",Koss-Mikołajczyk I; Baranowska M; Todorovic V; Albini A; Sansone C; Andreoletti P; Cherkaoui-Malki M; Lizard G; Noonan D; Sobajic S; Bartoszek A,Current pharmaceutical design,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31267861/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Consequently, the extra-skeletal impact of vitamin D deficiency has been an active area of research. While epidemiological and case-control studies have often suggested a link between vitamin D deficiency and conditions such as type 1 and type 2 diabetes, connective tissue disorders, inflammatory bowel disorders, chronic hepatitis, food allergies, asthma and respiratory infections, and cancer, interventional studies for the most part have failed to confirm a causative link.

31252568,Selenium and Health: An Update on the Situation in the Middle East and North Africa.,"Selenium (Se) is an important trace element that should be present in the diet of all age groups to provide an adequate intake. Se is incorporated in 25 known selenoproteins, which mediate the biological effects of Se including, immune response regulation, maintenance of thyroid function, antioxidant defense, and anti-inflammatory actions. A balanced intake of Se is critical to achieve health benefits because depending on its status, Se has been found to play physiological roles or contribute to the pathophysiology of various diseases including, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disorders. Se status and intake are very important to be known for a specific population as the levels of Se are highly variable among different populations and regions. In the Middle East and North African (MENA) region, very little is known about the status of Se. Studies available show that Se status is widely variable with some countries being deficient, some over sufficient, and some sufficient. This variability was apparent even within the same country between regions. In this review, we summarized the key roles of Se in health and disease and discussed the available data on Se status and intake among countries of the MENA region.",Ibrahim SAZ; Kerkadi A; Agouni A,Nutrients,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31252568/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31235166,A narrative review on effects of vitamin D on main risk factors and severity of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.,"The global prevalence of Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing rapidly. Many studies have been conducted on the treatment of NAFLD; nevertheless, there is still no approved drug treatment for this disease. Although the pathogenesis of NAFLD is not fully understood, but inflammation, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, obesity and dyslipidemia are among the main causes. Epidemiological studies have shown that hypovitaminosis D is associated with these factors causing NAFLD. In addition, rate of Vitamin D deficiency has been shown to be directly related to the severity of NAFLD. Accordingly, it is believed that vitamin D may help to treatment of NAFLD by improving the above-mentioned risk factors. The purpose of this review is to survey the recent advances in the field of Vitamin D efficacy on risk factors and the severity of NAFLD based on existing evidence, especially the clinical efficiency of vitamin D supplementation in patients with NAFLD.",Sangouni AA; Ghavamzadeh S; Jamalzehi A,Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31235166/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Despite the improvement in the development and implementation of guideline-directed medical therapy, the risk of adverse cardiac events remains substantially high. Historically, it has been debated whether omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids provide clinical benefit in cardiac disease. The recently published REDUCE-IT trial demonstrated a statistically significant absolute risk reduction of 4.8% in its primary endpoint (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina) with the use of icosapent ethyl, which is a highly purified eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) ethyl ester. However, the mechanism of action of omega-3 fatty acids is not commonly discussed. Moreover, the use of EPA was not without risk, as the incidence of atrial fibrillation was increased along with a trend towards increased bleeding risk. Thus, our aim is to help explain the function of purified EPA ethyl ester, especially at the molecular level, which will ultimately lead to a better understanding of their clinically observable effects.",Sheikh O; Vande Hei AG; Battisha A; Hammad T; Pham S; Chilton R,Cardiovascular diabetology,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31234885/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Developing effective strategies to prevent obesity is therefore of paramount importance. One potential strategy to reduce obesity is to consume calcium, which has been implicated to be involved in reducing body weight/fat. In this review, we compile the evidence for the anti-obesity roles of calcium in cells, animals, and humans. In addition, we summarize the possible anti-obesity mechanisms of calcium, including regulation of (a) adipogenesis, (b) fat metabolism, (c) adipocyte (precursor) proliferation and apoptosis, (d) thermogenesis, (e) fat absorption and excretion, and (f) gut microbiota. Although the exact anti-obesity roles of calcium in different subjects and how calcium induces the proposed anti-obesity mechanisms need to be further investigated, the current evidence demonstrates the anti-obesity effects of calcium and suggests the potential application of dietary calcium for prevention of obesity.",Zhang F; Ye J; Zhu X; Wang L; Gao P; Shu G; Jiang Q; Wang S,International journal of molecular sciences,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31234600/,1,0,0,0,0,0

This review aimed to discuss studies that investigated the impact of vinegar intake on the glycemic profile in humans and the putative mechanistic cellular pathways in both human and animal models. A search of literature was performed on the Cochrane, MEDLINE and Web of Science databases for articles published between 1995 and 2018. There is considerable support for vinegar having a positive acute effect on blood glucose levels when combined with carbohydrate-rich meals. Conversely, there are few chronic interventions analyzing the impact of vinegar intake on blood glucose. Based on available evidence, we hypothesize three pathways by which vinegar may improve blood glucose: The inhibition of α-amylase action; increased glucose uptake; and mediation by transcription factors. When evaluating the current body of literature, daily vinegar intake in amounts of ∼10-30 mL (∼2-6 tablespoons) appear to improve the glycemic response to carbohydrate-rich meals; however, there is a paucity of studies investigating chronic effects of vinegar intake.",Santos HO; de Moraes WMAM; da Silva GAR; Prestes J; Schoenfeld BJ,Clinical nutrition ESPEN,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31221273/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Recently, new molecular targets have been identified and exploited to treat this disease. Due to its pivotal role in glucose homeostasis, glucokinase (GCK) is a promising target for the development of novel antidiabetic drugs; however, pharmacological agents that modulate GCK activity have been linked to undesirable side-effects, limiting its use. Interestingly, plants might be a valuable source of new therapeutic compounds with GCK-activating properties and presumably no adverse effects. In this review, we describe biochemical characteristics related to the physiological and pathological importance of GCK, as well as the mechanisms involved in its regulation at different molecular levels. Posteriorly, we present a compendium of findings supporting the potential use of nutraceuticals and phytochemicals in the management of diabetes through modulation of GCK expression and activity.

31200589,Role of Vitamin D Status in Diabetic Patients with Renal Disease.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) poses a major public health problem worldwide, with ever-increasing incidence and prevalence in recent years. The Institute for Alternative Futures (IAF) expects that the total number of people with type 1 and type 2 DM in the United States will increase by 54%, from 19,629,000 to 54,913,000 people, between 2015 and 2030. Diabetic Nephropathy (DN) affects about one-third of patients with DM and currently ranks as the first cause of end-stage kidney disease in the Western world. The complexity of interactions of Vitamin D is directly related with progressive long-term changes implicated in the worsening of renal function. These changes result in a dysregulation of the vitamin D-dependent pathways. Various studies demonstrated a pivotal role of Vitamin D supplementation in regression of albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis, contrasting the increase of glomerular basement membrane thickening and podocyte effacement, with better renal and cardiovascular outcomes. The homeostasis and regulation of the nephron's function are absolutely dependent from the cross-talk between endothelium and podocytes. Even if growing evidence proves that vitamin D may have antiproteinuric, anti-inflammatory and renoprotective effects in patients with DN, it is still worth investigating these aspects with both more in vitro studies and randomized controlled trials in larger patient series and with adequate follow-up to confirm the effects of long-term vitamin D analogue supplementation in DN and to evaluate the effectiveness of this therapy and the appropriate dosage.",Gembillo G; Cernaro V; Salvo A; Siligato R; Laudani A; Buemi M; Santoro D,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31200589/,1,0,0,0,0,1
31177763,[The association of Vitamin D levels with lipid metabolism during pregnancy].,"Vitamin D deficiency is common in pregnant women, and it is associated with multiple gestational complications, fetal intrauterine dysplasia, and maternal and infant health in postpartum period. Vitamin D involved in lipid metabolism may affect maternal-fetal health during pregnancy through this biological pathway. This review provides an overview of three main aspects, including, the effect of vitamin D on the mechanism of lipid metabolism, the relationship between vitamin D and lipid metabolites in pregnant women and women with pregnancy complications. An association between vitamin D status and lipid metabolism at different stages of pregnancy has been justified in most current studies, and the underlying mechanism has also been partly elucidated. Given some gestational complications, such as gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia, pregnant women with these conditions are often associated with abnormal lipid metabolism and vitamin D deficiency. There is no doubt that the studies on the vitamin D supplementation and lipid metabolism improvement could have crucial clinical significance for this population. More randomized controlled trials with multi-center, large sample and multi-dose interventions are needed in the future to provide scientific evidence for clinical practice.",Jin D; Yao MN; Yin WJ; Zhu P,Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31177763/,1,0,0,0,0,0

A pooled analysis which assessed these parameters has not been performed. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to sum up existing evidence about the issue. We searched in MEDLINE and PUBMED for studies that were published before November 2018. Meta-analysis of diabetics and nondiabetics trials were performed by use of a random-effects model. A total of 13 case-control studies that included 428 subjects with body mass index ≥25 were identified. RS supplementation reduced fasting insulin in overall and stratified (diabetics and nondiabetics trials) analysis (SMD = -0.72; 95% CI: -1.13 to -0.31; SMD = -1.26; 95% CI: -1.66 to -0.86 and SMD = -0.64; 95% CI: -1.10 to -0.18, respectively), and reduced fasting glucose in overall and stratified analysis for diabetic trials (SMD = -0.26; 95% CI: -0.5 to -0.02 and SMD = -0.28; 95% CI: -0.54 to -0.01, respectively).

The aim of this meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was to assess the effects of zinc supplementation in preventing and managing diabetes. PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for articles that were published through February 10, 2019 and contained estimates for the outcomes of interest. The pooled results were then analyzed with the use of a random-effects model. Thirty-two placebo-controlled interventions were extracted from 36 publications, involving a total of 1700 participants in 14 countries. Overall, compared with their respective control groups, the subjects in the zinc-supplementation group had a statistically significant reduction in fasting glucose [FG, weighted mean difference (WMD): -14.15 mg/dL; 95% CI: -17.36, -10.93 mg/dL], 2-h postprandial glucose (WMD: -36.85 mg/dL; 95% CI: -62.05, -11.65 mg/dL), fasting insulin (WMD: -1.82 mU/L; 95% CI: -3.10, -0.54 mU/L), homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (WMD: -0.73; 95% CI: -1.22, -0.24), glycated hemoglobin (WMD: -0.55%; 95% CI: -0.84, -0.27%), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (WMD: -1.31 mg/L; 95% CI: -2.05, -0.56 mg/L) concentrations. Moreover, subgroup analyses revealed that the effects of zinc supplementation on FG are significantly influenced by diabetic status and the formulation of the zinc supplement. Our analysis revealed that several key glycemic indicators are significantly reduced by zinc supplementation, particularly the FG in subjects with diabetes and in subjects who received an inorganic zinc supplement. Together, these findings support the notion that zinc supplementation may have clinical potential as an adjunct therapy for preventing or managing diabetes.

31148299,Effectiveness and safety of selenium supplementation for type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials.,"The role of selenium (Se) in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains unclear. We systematically assessed the effectiveness and safety of Se supplementation in adults with T2DM. MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library were searched up to April 2018 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness of Se against a comparator on DM-related outcomes. Four RCTs (241 participants) were included. In individual RCTs, Se supplementation significantly reduced fasting insulin levels [mean difference (MD) = -3.6 μIU mL<sup>-1</sup> ; 95% confidence interval (CI) = -6.36 to -0.84; MD = -5.8 μIU mL<sup>-1</sup> ; 95% CI = -9.23 to -2.37], homeostasis model of assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (MD = -1; 95% CI = -1.79 to -0.21; MD = -1.6; 95% CI, -2.58 to -0.62) and homeostasis model of assessment-estimated B cell function (HOMA-B) (MD = -13.6; 95% CI = -23.4 to -3.8; MD = -22.6; 95% CI = -36.39 to -8.81). No effects of Se were noted on most of the other outcomes of interest. None of the RCTs assessed the mortality, diabetes-related complications, non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL), blood pressure and health-related quality of life. The impact on HDL and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was ambiguous. Only one adverse event (nausea) was reported as a reason for discontinuing the intervention; however, among the studies, the reporting was not accurate. Furthermore, only one RCT reported increase in FPG level in the Se group (MD = 36.38 mg dL<sup>-1</sup> ; 95% CI = 15.39-57.37). Currently, there is no evidence to support the effectiveness of Se supplementation in the T2DM population.",Stróżyk A; Osica Z; Przybylak JD; Kołodziej M; Zalewski BM; Mrozikiewicz-Rakowska B; Szajewska H,Journal of human nutrition and dietetics : the official journal of the British Dietetic Association,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31148299/,0,1,0,0,0,0

31115179,A meta-analysis of the effect of chromium supplementation on anthropometric indices of subjects with overweight or obesity.,"The role of chromium as a weight loss agent remains questionable, and although previous meta-analyses findings have reported small reductions in body weight in individuals with overweight/obesity following chromium supplementation, there have been significant limitations with these findings. The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the current evidence for the efficacy of oral chromium supplementation in individuals with overweight/obesity from randomized controlled trials. Studies were identified by a search of electronic databases from inception to November 2018 and combined and stratified analyses were used. Twenty-one trials from 19 studies were identified which met all inclusion criteria which were suitable for statistical pooling, and data from 1316 participants were included. Pooled analysis showed significant reductions in anthropometric indices associated with body composition; for weight loss (weighted mean difference [WMD]: -0.75 kg, 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.04, -0.45, P < 0.001), body mass index (WMD: -0.40, 95% CI, -0.66, -0.13, P = 0.003 and body fat percentage (WMD: -0.68%, 95% CI, -1.32, -0.03, P = 0.04) in individuals with overweight/obesity. No changes were detected in controls. Subgroup analysis showed significant improvements in weight loss and body fat percentage, particularly for study durations ≤12 weeks and doses ≤400 μg/d. Chromium supplementation was associated with some improvements in body composition in subjects with obesity/overweight. The effect size was medium and the clinical relevance of chromium as a weight loss aid remains uncertain.

31100793,The Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation on Glycaemic Control in Women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomised Controlled Trials.,"Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent amongst pregnant women and is linked to a range of adverse complications, including gestational diabetes. However, there is no consensus among researchers regarding the impact of vitamin D supplementation in alleviating adverse effects in gestational diabetes. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine whether supplementation of vitamin D given to women with gestational diabetes can promote glycaemic control. EMBASE and PubMed were searched up to November, 2018. The selection criteria included randomised controlled trials of the effect of vitamin D supplementation (1000-4762 IU/day) on pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus. Study data and outcome measures (fasting blood glucose, glycated haemoglobin and serum insulin) were extracted from included studies. Random-effects models were used for meta-analyses. Heterogeneity tests, and analysis of the risk of bias were conducted. Most of the studies were graded as having either low risk or moderate risk of bias although two studies had a high risk of bias in the areas of blinding of participants and personnel, and incomplete outcome data. On the other hand, the heterogeneity statistic (I<sup>2</sup>) ranged from 0-41% in the studies included. Five randomised controlled trials were selected for this review and meta-analysis (involving a total of 173 participants supplemented with vitamin D and 153 participants as control drawn from the studies). Vitamin D supplementation was associated with a decrease in fasting blood glucose by a mean of 0.46 mmol/L (-0.68, -0.25) (<i>p</i> < 0.001), glycated haemoglobin by a mean of 0.37% (-0.65, -0.08) (<i>p</i> < 0.01) and serum insulin concentration by mean of 4.10 µIU/mL (-5.50, -2.71) (<i>p</i> < 0.001) compared to controls. This review shows evidence that vitamin D supplementation has the potential to promote glycaemic control in women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM). However, due to the limited number of studies in the meta-analysis, the conclusion should be interpreted with caution. Further studies are needed to fully understand the exact mechanism by which vitamin D influences glucose metabolism.",Ojo O; Weldon SM; Thompson T; Vargo EJ,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31100793/,0,1,0,1,0,0
31099343,Health risk in transport workers. Part II. Dietary compounds as modulators of occupational exposure to chemicals.,"Professional drivers are exposed to a number of factors that have a negative influence on their health status. These include vibrations, noise, the lack of fresh air in the car cabin, shift work (frequently at night), monotony resulting from permanent repetition of certain actions, static loads due to immobilization in a sitting position, stress resulting from the need to ensure safety in heavy traffic, as well as air pollution (dust, volatile organic substances, nitrogen and sulfur oxides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals, dioxins, furans and others). Factors associated with the specificity of the profession of a driver, including exposure to chemical substances, result in an increased risk of the development of many diseases, i.e., obesity, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, extensive genitourinary pathology experienced by taxi drivers, lung cancer and other forms of cancer. In the case of drivers, especially those covering long distances, there are also actual difficulties related to ensuring a proper diet. Although attempts at interventional research that would change the principles of nutrition, as well as ensure physical activity and weight reduction, have been made, their results have not been satisfactory. The paper focuses on the discussion on the role of a diet and dietary phytochemicals in the prevention of adverse health effects of such chemicals as a mix of chemicals in the polluted air, benzo(a)pyrene, benzene and metals (lead, cadmium, chromium, nickel), which are the main sources of exposure in the case of transport workers.

31091354,Combined docosahexaenoic acid and thyroid hormone supplementation as a protocol supporting energy supply to precondition and afford protection against metabolic stress situations.,"Liver preconditioning (PC) refers to the development of an enhanced tolerance to injuring stimuli. For example, the protection from ischemia-reperfusion (IR) in the liver that is obtained by previous maneuvers triggering beneficial molecular and functional changes. Recently, we have assessed the PC effects of thyroid hormone (T<sub>3;</sub> single dose of 0.1 mg/kg) and n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFAs; daily doses of 450 mg/kg for 7 days) that abrogate IR injury to the liver. This feature is also achieved by a combined T<sub>3</sub> and the n-3 LCPUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) using a reduced period of supplementation of the FA (daily doses of 300 mg/kg for 3 days) and half of the T<sub>3</sub> dosage (0.05 mg/kg). T<sub>3</sub> -dependent protective mechanisms include (i) the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent activation of transcription factors nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), AP-1, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) upregulating the expression of protective proteins. (ii) ROS-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress affording proper protein folding. (iii) The autophagy response to produce FAs for oxidation and ATP supply and amino acids for protein synthesis. (iv) Downregulation of inflammasome nucleotide-bonding oligomerization domain leucine-rich repeat containing family pyrin containing 3 and interleukin-1β expression to prevent inflammation. N-3 LCPUFAs induce antioxidant responses due to Nrf2 upregulation, with inflammation resolution being related to production of oxidation products and NF-κB downregulation. Energy supply to achieve liver PC is met by the combined DHA plus T<sub>3</sub> protocol through upregulation of AMPK coupled to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α signaling. In conclusion, DHA plus T<sub>3</sub> coadministration favors hepatic bioenergetics and lipid homeostasis that is of crucial importance in acute and clinical conditions such as IR, which may be extended to long-term or chronic situations including steatosis in obesity and diabetes. © 2019 IUBMB Life, 71(9):1211-1220, 2019.",Videla LA,IUBMB life,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31091354/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31083508,"Impact of Supplementary Amino Acids, Micronutrients, and Overall Diet on Glutathione Homeostasis.","Glutathione (GSH) is a critical endogenous antioxidant found in all eukaryotic cells. Higher GSH concentrations protect against cellular damage, tissue degeneration, and disease progression in various models, so there is considerable interest in developing interventions that augment GSH biosynthesis. Oral GSH supplementation is not the most efficient option due to the enzymatic degradation of ingested GSH within the intestine by γ-glutamyltransferase, but supplementation of its component amino acids-cysteine, glycine, and glutamate-enhances tissue GSH synthesis. Furthermore, supplementation with some non-precursor amino acids and micronutrients appears to influence the redox status of GSH and related antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E, lowering systemic oxidative stress and slowing the rate of tissue deterioration. In this review, the effects of oral supplementation of amino acids and micronutrients on GSH metabolism are evaluated. And since specific dietary patterns and diets are being prescribed as first-line therapeutics for conditions such as hypertension and diabetes, the impact of overall diets on GSH homeostasis is also assessed.",Gould RL; Pazdro R,Nutrients,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31083508/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31083045,The Physiological Roles of Carnosine and β-Alanine in Exercising Human Skeletal Muscle.,"Carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine) plays an important role in exercise performance and skeletal muscle homeostasis. Dietary supplementation with the rate-limiting precursor β-alanine leads to an increase in skeletal muscle carnosine content, which further potentiates its effects. There is significant interest in carnosine and β-alanine across athletic and clinical populations. Traditionally, attention has been given to performance outcomes with less focus on the underlying mechanism(s). Putative physiological roles in human skeletal muscle include acting as an intracellular pH buffer, modulating energy metabolism, regulating Ca handling and myofilament sensitivity, and scavenging of reactive species. Emerging evidence shows that carnosine could also act as a cytoplasmic Ca-H exchanger and form stable conjugates with exercise-induced reactive aldehydes. The enigmatic nature of carnosine means there is still much to learn regarding its actions and applications in exercise, health, and disease. In this review, we examine the research relating to each physiological role attributed to carnosine, and its precursor β-alanine, in exercising human skeletal muscle.",Matthews JJ; Artioli GG; Turner MD; Sale C,Medicine and science in sports and exercise,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31083045/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31077653,Fish Oil and Cardiometabolic Diseases: Recent Updates and Controversies.,"Fatty acids derived from fish oil are long-chain omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids. The important polyunsaturated fatty acids of fish oil are eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid. For decades, there has been a debate about the use of omega-3 fatty acids and their benefits on cardiovascular health. The more recent trials including the JELIS, VITAL, STRENGTH, and ASCEND trials, addressed the paucity of data of omega-3 fatty acids on primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events and the risk-benefit balance of these supplements. Prior to these studies, many large randomized controlled trials have shown conflicting results on the effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids in patients with prior coronary artery disease, stroke, or major vascular events. These inconsistent results warrant a better understanding of the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on the subtypes of cardiovascular diseases, and their use in primary and secondary prevention. More recently, icosapent ethyl showed a significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality and ischemic events in patients with elevated triglyceride (TG) and established cardiovascular disease or diabetes. The REDUCE-IT trial paved the way to further reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with high TG despite being on a maximally tolerated statin. The aim of this review is to discuss these recent updates on the use of various forms of fish oil, including prescription form and supplement in cardiometabolic diseases, and their surrounding controversies.",Tummala R; Ghosh RK; Jain V; Devanabanda AR; Bandyopadhyay D; Deedwania P; Aronow WS,The American journal of medicine,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31077653/,1,0,0,0,0,0

PubMed, SCOPUS and Web of Science databases were searched. All clinical trials which investigated the effect of oral administration of probiotic or synbiotic on inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL) 1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, interferon (IFN) γ and transforming growth factor (TGF) β) for more than one week with concurrent control groups were included. One-hundred sixty seven publications was analysed. Results were as follows: CRP decreased in healthy, metabolic disorders, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), arthritis and critically ill condition but not in renal failure. IL-1B: no change in healthy subjects and arthritis. TNF-α: decreased in healthy, fatty liver, IBD and hepatic cirrhosis, no change in diabetes, metabolic syndrome (MS) + PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) and arthritis. IL-6: no change in healthy, metabolic disorders and arthritis, increased in cirrhosis and renal failure, decreased in PCOS + MS. IL-10: no change in healthy, IBD and metabolic disorders, increased in arthritis. IL-4, IL-8, IL-12, IFN-g and TGF-b: no change in healthy subjects.

30987058,Nutraceuticals for the Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common complications of diabetes mellitus and is characterized by degeneration of retinal neurons and neoangiogenesis, causing a severe threat to vision. Nowadays, the principal treatment options for DR are laser photocoagulation, vitreoretinal surgery, or intravitreal injection of drugs targeting vascular endothelial growth factor. However, these treatments only act at advanced stages of DR, have short term efficacy, and cause side effects. Treatment with nutraceuticals (foods providing medical or health benefits) at early stages of DR may represent a reasonable alternative to act upstream of the disease, preventing its progression. In particular, in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed that a variety of nutraceuticals have significant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may inhibit the early diabetes-driven molecular mechanisms that induce DR, reducing both the neural and vascular damage typical of DR. Although most studies are limited to animal models and there is the problem of low bioavailability for many nutraceuticals, the use of these compounds may represent a natural alternative method to standard DR treatments.",Rossino MG; Casini G,Nutrients,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30987058/,1,0,0,0,0,0

This meta-analysis assessed the efficacy and safety of curcumin with respect to improving glucose metabolism in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Four databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Embase) were searched up to June 2018. The inclusion criteria included (i) randomised controlled trials (RCT) and (ii) subjects with risk factors for cardiovascular disease supplemented with curcumin and curcuminoids. A random-effects model and a standardised mean difference with a 95% confidence interval were used to perform quantitative data synthesis. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were conducted to assess the effects. Fourteen eligible RCT with 1277 subjects were included. In the overall analyses, curcumin led to significant decreases in fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). The subgroup analyses suggested that curcumin or combined curcuminoids were more effective at reducing FBG and HbA1c in type 2 diabetes patients than in individuals with metabolic syndrome. Supplementation with curcuminoids at doses ≥300 mg day<sup>-1</sup> showed significant decreases in FBG, HbA1c and HOMA-IR. The effects of supplementation on FBG, HbA1c and HOMA-IR were more significant over long periods (≥12 weeks) than short periods. Curcumin and curcuminoids were well tolerated, with no serious adverse events. Curcumin or combined curcuminoids could exert cardioprotective effects in patients at risk for cardiovascular disease by improving glucose metabolism.

After several neutral CVD outcome trials with n-3 fatty acids, the Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with EPA-Intervention Trial met its primary end point, that is, among patients with elevated TGs levels despite the use of statins, the risk of ischemic events, including cardiovascular death, was significantly lower in those who received 4 g of icosapent ethyl daily. In this review, we comment on the findings of previous and recently published randomized controlled CVD outcome trials assessing n-3 fatty acids supplementation.

30956643,Prostate cancer metastasis and soy isoflavones: a dogfight over a bone.,"Prostate cancer is a complex, progressive, bone-tropic disease, which is usually associated with skeletal issues, poor mobility and a fatal outcome when it reaches the metastatic phase. Soy isoflavones, steroid-like compounds from soy-based food/dietary supplements, have been found to decrease the risk of prostate cancer in frequent consumers. Herein, we present a systematization of the data on soy isoflavone effects at different stages of metastatic prostate cancer progression, with a particular interest in the context of bone-related molecular events. Specifically, soy isoflavones have been determined to downregulate the prostate cancer cell androgen receptors, reverse the epithelial to mesenchymal transition of these cells, decrease the expressions of prostate-specific antigen, matrix metalloproteinase and serine proteinase, and reduce the superficial membrane fluidity in prostate cancer cells. In addition, soy isoflavones suppress the angiogenesis that follows prostate cancer growth, obstruct prostate cancer cells adhesion to the vascular endothelium and their extravasation in the area of future bone lesions, improve the general bone morphofunctional status, have a beneficial effect on prostate cancer metastasis-caused osteolytic/osteoblastic lesions and possibly affect the pre-metastatic niche formation. The observed, multilevel antimetastatic properties of soy isoflavones imply that they should be considered as promising components of combined therapeutic approaches to advanced prostate cancer.",Ajdžanovic V; Filipovic B; Miljic D; Mijatovic S; Maksimovic-Ivanic D; Miler M; Živanovic J; Miloševic V,EXCLI journal,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30956643/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The aim of this study was to summarize study results regarding the effects of garlic supplementation on serum inflammatory biomarkers in adults. We searched Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar and Cochrane library databases for relevant papers published until April 2018, using keywords such as ""garlic"" and ""inflammatory biomarker."" We included RCTs that 1) were conducted in adults, 2) examined the effects of garlic supplementation on inflammatory biomarkers compared to a control group, and 3) reported sufficient data on inflammatory biomarkers. Results were reported as weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% CI using random effects models. Cochrane's Q and I-squared (I2) tests were used to determine heterogeneity among studies. Funnel plots and Egger's regression test were used to assess publication bias. Sixteen RCTs were included. Garlic doses ranged from 12 to 3600 mg/d, and intervention duration ranged from 2 to 52 wk. Garlic administration significantly reduced serum C-reactive protein (CRP) (n = 13) (WMD: -0.61 mg/L, 95% CI: -1.12, -0.11, P = 0.018, I2 = 76.9%), IL-6 (n = 5) (WMD: -0.73 ng/L, 95% CI: -1.06, -0.40, P < 0.001, I2 = 0%), and TNF (n = 7) (WMD: -0.26 ng/L, 95% CI: -0.41, -0.12, P < 0.001, I2 = 0.0%), compared to controls.

We performed a systematic search of all available RCTs conducted up to October 2018 in the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane. RCTs that investigated the effect of folate on CRP were included in the present study. Data were combined with the use of generic inverse-variance random-effects models. Statistical heterogeneity between studies was evaluated using Cochran's Q-test. Ten RCTs (1179 subjects) were included in the present meta-analysis. Pooled analysis results showed that folate supplementation significantly lowered the serum CRP level (weighted mean difference (WMD): -0.685 mg/l, 95% CI: -1.053, -0.318, p < 0.001). However, heterogeneity was significant (I<sup>2</sup> = 96.7%, p = 0.000). Stratified analyses indicated that sex, intervention period, and type of study population were sources of heterogeneity. Following analysis, results revealed that the greatest impact was observed in women (WMD: -0.967 mg/l, 95% CI: -1.101, -0.833, p = 0.000), patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (WMD: -1.764 mg/l, 95% CI: -2.002, -1.526, p = 0.000), and intervention period less than 12 weeks (WMD: -0.742 mg/l, 95% CI: -0.834, -0.650, p = 0.000).

30935723,AMPK in microvascular complications of diabetes and the beneficial effects of AMPK activators from plants.,"Diabetes mellitus is a multifactorial disorder with the risk of micro- and macro-vascular complications. High glucose-induced derangements in metabolic pathways are primarily associated with the initiation and progression of secondary complications namely, diabetic nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target to treat various metabolic disorders including diabetes mellitus. It is a master metabolic regulator that helps in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis by promoting ATP-generating catabolic pathways and inhibiting ATP-consuming anabolic pathways. Numerous pharmacological and plant-derived bioactive compounds that increase AMP-activated protein kinase activation has shown beneficial effects by mitigating secondary complications namely retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. The purpose of this review is to highlight current knowledge on the role of AMPK and its activators from plant origin in diabetic microvascular complications. Search engines such as Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct and Web of Science are used to extract papers using relevant key words. Papers mainly focusing on the role of AMPK and AMPK activators from plant origin in diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy was chosen to be highlighted. According to results, decrease in AMPK activation during diabetes play a causative role in the pathogenesis of diabetic microvascular complications. Some of the plant-derived bioactive compounds were beneficial in restoring AMPK activity and ameliorating diabetic microvascular complications. AMPK activators from plant origin are beneficial in mitigating diabetic microvascular complications. These pieces of evidence will be helpful in the development of AMPK-centric therapies to mitigate diabetic microvascular complications.",Shrikanth CB; Nandini CD,Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30935723/,1,0,0,0,0,0

30921234,Dietary ginger as a traditional therapy for blood sugar control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Ancient medical practitioners used to encourage dietary supplements and herbal medicine for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Ginger (Zingiber officinale), is a nontoxic spice with negligible side effects, and is considered safe by the food and drug administration. In this analysis, we aimed to systematically compare fasting blood sugar (FBS) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at baseline versus at follow-up in T2DM patients who consumed and who did not consume ginger. A literature search was carried out through MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central, and www.ClinicalTrials.gov for English-published trials comparing glucose parameters in T2DM patients who were assigned to ginger consumption versus a control group. All the participants were patients with T2DM who were either assigned to ginger therapy (1600- 4000 mg daily) or to a control group. FBS and HbA1c were assessed in the ginger and control groups, respectively, from baseline to follow-up to observe any significant change. Weight mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated to represent the analysis which was carried out by the RevMan 5.3 software. Eight randomized trials consisting of a total number of 454 participants with T2DM were included in this analysis. At first, FBS was compared in patients with T2DM from baseline prior to ginger consumption until follow-up after ginger consumption. The results showed no significant difference in FBS (WMD: 1.38, 95% CI: [-0.53-3.30]; P = .16). For the T2DM patients who did not consume ginger, no significant difference in FBS was observed (WMD: -0.27, 95% CI: [-5.09-4.54]; P = .91). However, a significantly improved HbA1c from baseline to follow-up was observed in those participants with ginger consumption (WMD: 0.46, 95% CI: [0.09-0.84]; P = .02) whereas in the control group, no significant difference in HbA1c was observed (WMD: -0.23, 95% CI: [-0.60-0.14]; P = .22). This analysis involving patients with T2DM showed no significant difference in FBS with ginger consumption. However, dietary ginger significantly improved HbA1c from baseline to follow-up showing that this natural medicine might have an impact on glucose control over a longer period of time in patients with T2DM.",Huang FY; Deng T; Meng LX; Ma XL,Medicine,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30921234/,0,1,0,1,0,1
30915723,Supplemental calcium intake in the aging individual: implications on skeletal and cardiovascular health.,"Adequate calcium intake during childhood is necessary to achieve optimal peak bone mass and this has the potential by increasing bone reserves, to modulate the rate of age-associated bone loss. However, data regarding the efficacy of calcium obtained either through the diet or in the form of medicinal supplementation, for prevention of bone loss and osteoporotic fractures in the elderly is conflicting. Calcium alone is unlikely to be of benefit for this purpose though the co-administration of calcium and vitamin D may have modest fracture risk benefits. Supplemental calcium with or without vitamin D has recently come into the spotlight after the publication of the findings from a controversial randomized controlled trial that associated calcium supplementation with an increased risk of myocardial infarction. Since then, multiple studies have explored this potential link. The data remains conflicting and the potential mechanistic link if any exists, remains elusive. This review examines the relationship between supplemental calcium intake and skeletal and cardiovascular health in the aging individual through an appraisal of studies done on the subject in the last three decades. It also briefly details some of the studies evaluating fractional absorption of calcium in the elderly and the rationale behind the current recommended dietary allowances of calcium.",Chandran M; Tay D; Mithal A,Aging clinical and experimental research,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30915723/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30915570,"The therapeutic and nutraceutical potential of agmatine, and its enhanced production using Aspergillus oryzae.","Agmatine, a natural polyamine produced from arginine by arginine decarboxylase, was first discovered in 1910, but its physiological significance was disregarded for a century. The recent rediscovery of agmatine as an endogenous ligand for α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic and imidazoline receptors in the mammalian brain suggests that this amine may be a promising therapeutic agent for treating a broad spectrum of central nervous system-associated diseases. In the past two decades, numerous preclinical and several clinical studies have demonstrated its pleiotropic modulatory functions on various molecular targets related to neurotransmission, nitric oxide synthesis, glucose metabolism, polyamine metabolism, and carnitine biosynthesis, indicating potential for therapeutic applications and use as a nutraceutical to improve quality of life. An enzymatic activity of arginine decarboxylase which produces agmatine from arginine was low in mammals, suggesting that a large portion of the agmatine is supplemented from diets and gut microbiota. In the present review, we focus on and concisely summarize the beneficial effects of agmatine for treating depression, anxiety, neuropathic pain, cognitive decline and learning impairment, dependence on drugs, and metabolic diseases (diabetes and obesity), since these fields have been intensively investigated. We also briefly discuss agmatine content in foodstuffs, and a simple approach for enhancing agmatine production using the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae, widely used for the production of various Asian fermented foods.",Akasaka N; Fujiwara S,Amino acids,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30915570/,1,0,0,0,0,0

In this regard, in recent years, significant advances have been achieved, assisted by both newly developed analytical tools and basic knowledge on the biological implications of oxylipins. Hence, in the light of this recent progress, this review aims to provide an update on the relevance of human oxylipins during pregnancy and in the unborn and newborn child, covering two fundamental aspects. Firstly, the evidence from human clinical studies and dietary intervention trials will be used to shed light on the extent to which dietary supplementation can modulate the lipidomic markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in the perinatal state, emphasizing the role of the placenta and metabolic disturbances in the mother and fetus. The second part of this article comprises a review of existing data on specific pathophysiological aspects of human reproduction, in relation to lipidomic markers in pregnant women, unborn children, and newborn children.

30901325,Efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in gestational diabetes mellitus: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials.,"Trials have examined on the benefits of vitamin D supplementation in pregnant women. This review aimed to evaluate whether oral vitamin D supplements, when given to pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), would improve maternal and neonatal outcomes, compared with no treatment or placebo. We performed a systematic review following Cochrane methodology, and randomized trials were included where pregnant women with GDM received vitamin D supplementation versus placebo/no treatment or vitamin D and calcium versus placebo/no treatment. Primary outcomes were preeclampsia, preterm birth, cesarean delivery, gestational hypertension, and adverse events related to vitamin D supplementation. The search strategies were applied to the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and CENTRAL. Similar outcomes in at least two trials were plotted using Review Manager 5.3 software. The quality of evidence was generated according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). The total of 1224 references were identified, eleven trials were potentially eligible, and six were included in this review (totaling 456 women). The meta-analysis of frequency of cesarean deliveries did not show significant differences between groups, none of the trials evaluated the remaining primary outcomes. For secondary outcomes, our results suggest that vitamin D supplementation in pregnant women with GDM may reduce newborn complications such as hyperbilirubinemia, polyhydramnios (RR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.68; RR: 0.17, 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.89; respectively), and the need for maternal or infant hospitalization (RR: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.98; RR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.69).

30889626,Inositol and antioxidant supplementation: Safety and efficacy in pregnancy.,"Pregnancies complicated by diabetes have largely increased in number over the last 50 years. Pregnancy is characterized by a physiologic increase in insulin resistance, which, associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammations, could induce alterations of glucose metabolism and diabetes. If not optimally controlled, these conditions have a negative impact on maternal and foetal outcomes. To date, one can resort only to diet and lifestyle to treat obesity and insulin resistance during pregnancy, and insulin remains the only therapeutic option to manage diabetes during pregnancy. However, in the last years, in a variety of experimental models, inositol and antioxidants supplementation have shown insulin-sensitizing, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties, which could be mediated by some possible complementary mechanism of action. Different isomers and multiple combinations of these compounds are presently available: Aim of the present review article is to examine the existing evidence in order to clarify and/or define the effects of different inositol- and antioxidant-based supplements during pregnancy complicated by insulin resistance and/or by diabetes.

30870330,Effectiveness of dietary inorganic nitrate for lowering blood pressure in hypertensive adults: a systematic review.,"The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of inorganic nitrate on blood pressure in hypertensive adults. Hypertension is associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality in adults. Inorganic nitrate could be beneficial for lowering blood pressure and reducing cardiovascular disease risks. Evidence related to the treatment of hypertension through sources of inorganic nitrate has been presented. The review considered studies on adults aged 18 years and over, with blood pressure greater than 120/80 mmHg, undergoing interventions focusing on the effects of inorganic nitrate on blood pressure. Studies that included inorganic nitrate intake via dietary modification, in the form of a dietary supplement, and/or by the consumption of beetroot juice were considered. The comparator was no intervention of inorganic nitrate; different dosage, frequency, duration of inorganic nitrate; and other interventions that are administered to reduce and manage blood pressure. The primary outcomes were systolic and diastolic blood pressure effects. Experimental, quasi-experimental, analytical observational and pilot study designs were considered for inclusion. Databases were searched for published and unpublished studies, available in English, from January 2013 to January 2018. Critical appraisal was conducted using standardized instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) and the methodological quality of included studies was considered to be moderate. Data were extracted using the JBI data extraction instrument. Data were presented in a narrative form due to the heterogeneity of included studies. Twelve papers were included in the systematic review with a total of 321 participants. Ten were randomized controlled trials and two were quasi-experimental studies. All participants had baseline blood pressures greater than 120/80 mmHg. Some studies included participants with comorbidities such as diabetes or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Inorganic nitrate was administered multiple ways throughout the studies including the following: beetroot juice, beetroot gel, nitric oxide lozenge, high nitrate diet, and raw and cooked beet juice. Doses and treatment intervals varied. Some studies included exercise as part of the intervention protocol.Meta-analysis was not conducted due to heterogeneity that existed within the studies. Blood pressure was measured in multiple settings by manual, digital or ambulatory means. The noted outcome patterns were as follows: no change in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, decrease in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, or decrease in systolic blood pressure with no change in diastolic blood pressure. Possible reasons for the diverse findings include the following: age, comorbidities, use of antihypertensives by participants; source and dose of nitrate; and intervention and follow-up time frames. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of inorganic nitrate for any effect on blood pressure at this time. Therefore, there is no concrete base for the development of practice guidelines until stronger evidence becomes available. The gaps in the literature along with the study limitations identified necessitate the need for more research on inorganic nitrate and how it relates to blood pressure.",Remington J; Winters K,JBI database of systematic reviews and implementation reports,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30870330/,0,1,0,0,0,1
30855110,"Chromium Supplementation in Human Health, Metabolic Syndrome, and Diabetes.","After 40 years of significant work, it was generally accepted that chromium in its trivalent valence state, Cr(III), is an essential micronutrient for humans. This view began to be challenged around the turn of the millennium. Some investigators argue that its effects on glucose and lipid metabolism reflect a pharmacological rather than a nutritional mode of action while yet others express concern about the toxicity and safety of supplemental chromium. Understanding the conjectures requires a reflection on the different definitions of ""essential"" and a perspective on the development of the field, which in itself is a remarkable snippet of science history and education. At the center of the discussion is our failure to have established a molecular structure and a specific site of action of a biological chromium complex. Instead, many different types of Cr(III) complexes, in particular chromium picolinate, but also those with nicotinate, propionate, histidinate, chloride, and other ligands, all with different chemical properties and biological activities, are being used in laboratory investigations and supplementation. Without knowledge of the metabolic transformations and the specific chemical properties that biological ligands impart on chromium, many of these investigations, in particular those ex vivo, have limited value for understanding chromium's biological function. Whether a chromium deficiency exists in humans and who is affected is poorly defined. There is evidence for the efficacy of chromium supplements in improving conditions in metabolic syndrome and in some diabetes Type 2 patients, but there are no effects on body composition in healthy individuals. Chromium is present in human tissues and in our food and Cr(III) compounds are given in (total) parenteral nutrition, taken as a supplement by athletes and bodybuilders, are ingredients of vitamin pills consumed by the general population, and are employed in animal nutrition. Another contentious issue is whether Cr(III) complexes are safe, as chromium in its hexavalent state, Cr(VI) (chromate), is genotoxic and a group I carcinogen for humans with sufficient evidence for inhalation and lung cancer. For the benefit of human health, there is a continuing need for a balanced view and informed and robust experiments to determine the specific biological molecules that are involved in the metabolism of Cr(III), the activity of biological Cr(III) complexes at specific sites of action, and the amount of supplemental Cr(III) that potentially causes long-term toxicity.",Maret W,Metal ions in life sciences,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30855110/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30850697,Systematic Review and Meta-analysis on the Effect of Soy on Thyroid Function.,"Soy foods have had an important dietary role in Asian countries for centuries, and in recent years they have become increasingly popular in Western countries as a result of their suggested health benefits. Nevertheless, there are some concerns that soy can have a negative effect on thyroid function and can alter the levels of thyroid hormones. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the link between soy or soy product consumption and thyroid function via the measurement of thyroid hormone levels. A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken on all randomised controlled trials of studies including soy as an intervention and where free triiodothyronine (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was measured. The search included PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane and sources for the grey literature. Quantitative data synthesis was performed using a random-effects model, with standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval as summary statistics. A total of 18 articles were suitable for review. The meta-analysis showed no significant changes in fT3 (WMD: 0.027 pmol/L, 95% CI: -0.052, 0.107, p = 0.499; I<sup>2</sup>: 55.58%), fT4 (WMD: -0.003 pmol/L, 95% CI: -0.018, 0.011, p = 0.656; I<sup>2</sup>: 87.58%) while an elevation in TSH levels was observed (WMD: 0.248 mIU/L, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.494, p = 0.049; I<sup>2</sup>: 80.31%) levels with soy supplementation.

30824393,Maternal risk factors and newborn infant vitamin D status: a scoping literature review.,"Low vitamin D (VitD) status is common among newborn infants, more so in temperate latitudes with evidence that maternal VitD deficiency is a major risk factor given that the neonate relies solely on maternal-fetal transfer of VitD. This scoping review was conducted to provide an overview of the latest evidence from studies regarding the impact of maternal risk factors on infant 25-hydryoxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations with a focus on studies in Canada and the United States. Several maternal risk factors that contribute to low maternal-fetal 25(OH)D concentrations have been reported over many decades, but no clear pattern has been established for multiethnic populations. For example, darker skin pigmentation and ethnicity are common risk factors for low VitD status. Studies in predominantly white women showed that supplementation of VitD during pregnancy causes significant increases in maternal serum 25(OH)D which often improves cord serum 25(OH)D values. In addition, VitD recommendations by health care professionals and adherence to supplementation by pregnant women appear to positively influence maternal and infant 25(OH)D concentrations. Conversely, winter season, obesity, lower socioeconomic status including lifestyle factors (smoking), and use of medication pose risk for lower maternal-fetal transfer of VitD. However, there is still a dearth of pertinent data on the relationship between some of the maternal risk factors and newborn 25(OH)D concentrations, for instance, relationships between gestational diabetes and neonatal VitD status.

Proper and flexible methods of nutrition therapy that successfully regulate maternal glycaemia while improving expected fetal growth have extensive concepts. Meanwhile, dietary supplements with proven beneficial effects can play an important role in improving deficiencies and improving the metabolic profile of patients. <b>Conclusion:</b> Nutritional management is the main treatment for gestational diabetes mellitus and overweight/obesity is the principal contest in patient counseling and interventions during pregnancy. Despite extensive researches carried out, this field is an active research area and requires more clinical research to minimize maternal and fetal complications.",Dolatkhah N; Hajifaraji M; Shakouri SK,Journal of family & reproductive health,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30820209/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30797623,Plant-derived natural agents as dietary supplements for the regulation of glycosylated hemoglobin: A review of clinical trials.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder affecting a growing number of patients all over the world. T2DM complications are positively associated with HbA1c which is a long-term glycemic marker. Medicinal plants and their isolated phytochemicals have been extensively used as dietary supplements for the management of chronic disorders including T2DM. Current paper aims to review clinical trials evaluated the effect of phytochemicals for long-term management of T2DM considering the HbA1c level. Electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane were searched using the keywords ""phytochemical"", ""extract"", ""herb"", or ""plant"" and ""HbA1c"" or ""glycosylated hemoglobin"" in the title/abstract from the date of inception until May 2017. English and Persian language papers were included. References of the retrieved papers were also screened for relevant studies. Of 2435 studies, 39 relevant clinical trials were finally included in which phytochemicals including berberine, curcumin, catechin, silymarin, resveratrol, pycnogenol, isoflavones, lignans, isohumulone, saponins, corn bran hemicellulose and pinitol were examined. Berberine and silymarin had the strongest evidence regarding their effectiveness in long-term management of HbA1c; however, lack of enough toxicological studies suggests to stay on the safe side for the administration of these agents in diabetic patients. Current data regarding the efficacy of other phytochemicals are still controversial due to small follow-up period, methodological problems and small sample size. Future well-designed clinical trials are necessary to confirm the safety and efficacy of phytochemicals for long-term glycemic control of diabetic patients.",Rezaeiamiri E; Bahramsoltani R; Rahimi R,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30797623/,1,0,0,0,0,1
30796433,State of the art review: oral and nasal vitamin B12 therapy in the elderly.,"The objective of this narrative review was to provide an update on oral and nasal vitamin B12 (cobalamin) therapy in elderly patients. Relevant articles were identified by 'PubMed' and 'Scholar Google' search from January 2010 to July 2018 and through hand search of relevant reference articles. Additional studies were obtained from references of identified studies, the 'Cochrane Library' and the 'ISI Web of Knowledge'. Data retrieved from international meetings were also used, as was information retrieved from commercial sites on the web and data from 'CARE B12' research group. For oral vitamin B12 therapy, four prospective randomized controlled trials, eight prospective studies, one systematic and four reviews fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The studies included mainly or exclusively elderly patients (≥65-year-olds). In all of the studies, the mean age of the patients was at least 70 years except for two. The present review documents that oral vitamin B12 replacement at 1000 μg daily proved adequate to cure vitamin B12 deficiency, with a good safety profile. The efficacy was particularly marked when considering the noticeable improvement in serum vitamin B12 levels and haematological parameters, such as haemoglobin level, mean erythrocyte cell volume and reticulocyte count. The effect of oral cobalamin treatment in patients presenting with severe neurological manifestations has not yet been adequately documented. For nasal vitamin B12, only a few preliminary studies were available. We conclude that oral vitamin B12 is an effective alternative to intramuscular vitamin B12 injections in elderly patients. Oral vitamin B12 treatment avoids the discomfort, inconvenience and cost of monthly injections.",Andrès E; Zulfiqar AA; Vogel T,QJM : monthly journal of the Association of Physicians,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30796433/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30794924,The effect of probiotic and synbiotic supplementation on biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress in diabetic patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"The role of gut microbiota in the management of diabetes has been shown. Several current trials are investigating the effect of probiotics and prebiotics, which are widely used to modulate intestinal microbiota, on inflammatory factors and biomarkers of oxidative stress in diabetic patients; however, their findings are controversial. The aim of the current meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of probiotic and synbiotic supplementation on levels of serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and biomarkers of oxidative stress in diabetic patients. We searched the PubMed, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library databases from the inception to October 31, 2018. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which reported the effect of probiotics or synbiotics on circulating (serum and plasma) inflammatory marker (hs-CRP) and oxidative stress indicators (malondialdehyde [MDA], glutathione [GSH], nitric oxide [NO], and total antioxidant capacity [TAC]) among patients with diabetes were included. Eligible studies were assessed for risk of bias and subjected to qualitative and quantitative synthesis using either fixed- or random-effects models accounting for clinical heterogeneity. Our meta-analysis identified 16 eligible RCTs (n = 1060). The methodological quality varied across these trials. Pooled data from these trials demonstrated that probiotic and synbiotic consumption significantly decreased hs-CRP level (standardized mean difference [SMD]=-0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI]:-0.51,-0.24; P = 0.000) and MDA (SMD=-0.61; 95% CI: -0.89, -0.32; P = 0.000) in diabetic patients compared to those in subjects receiving placebos. In addition, probiotic and symbiotic supplementation was found to increase TAC (SMD = 0.31; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.52; P = 0.006), NO (SMD, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.99; P = 0.001) and GSH (SMD = 0.41; 95% CI: 0.26, 0.55, P = 0.000) levels. The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that probiotic and synbiotic supplementation may help to improve biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. Further studies are needed to develop clinical practice guidelines for the management of inflammation and oxidative stress in these patients.",Zheng HJ; Guo J; Jia Q; Huang YS; Huang WJ; Zhang W; Zhang F; Liu WJ; Wang Y,Pharmacological research,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30794924/,0,1,0,1,0,0
30791647,Macronutrient and Micronutrient Intake during Pregnancy: An Overview of Recent Evidence.,"Nutritional status during pregnancy can have a significant impact on maternal and neonatal health outcomes. Requirements for macronutrients such as energy and protein increase during pregnancy to maintain maternal homeostasis while supporting foetal growth. Energy restriction can limit gestational weight gain in women with obesity; however, there is insufficient evidence to support energy restriction during pregnancy. In undernourished women, balanced energy/protein supplementation may increase birthweight whereas high protein supplementation could have adverse effects on foetal growth. Modulating carbohydrate intake via a reduced glycaemic index or glycaemic load diet may prevent gestational diabetes and large-for-gestational-age infants. Certain micronutrients are also vital for improving pregnancy outcomes, including folic acid to prevent neural tube defects and iodine to prevent cretinism. Newly published studies support the use of calcium supplementation to prevent hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, particularly in women at high risk or with low dietary calcium intake. Although gaps in knowledge remain, research linking nutrition during pregnancy to maternofoetal outcomes has made dramatic advances over the last few years. In this review, we provide an overview of the most recent evidence pertaining to macronutrient and micronutrient requirements during pregnancy, the risks and consequences of deficiencies and the effects of supplementation on pregnancy outcomes.",Mousa A; Naqash A; Lim S,Nutrients,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30791647/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The nutritional and medicinal values of radishes have been proven by several researches. Extracts prepared from the aerial and underground parts of radishes have been used in the treatment of stomach disorders, urinary infections, hepatic inflammation, cardiac disorders and ulcers in folk medicine since the ancient times. The pharmaceutical potential of radishes is attributed to the presence of its beneficial secondary metabolites, such as glucosinolates, polyphenols and isothiocyanates. The present review has focused on the impact of radish extract administration under pathological complications, such as cancer, diabetes, hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress. In addition, a comprehensive view of molecular mechanism behind the regulation of molecular drug targets associated with different types of cancers and diabetes by the bioactive compounds present in the radish extracts have been discussed in detail.",Manivannan A; Kim JH; Kim DS; Lee ES; Lee HE,Nutrients,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30769862/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We hypothesize that a dietary fiber intake can bringbenefits to diabetic kidney disease (DKD), improving renal outcomes. This systematic review aimedto evaluate the effect of dietary fiber (supplemental or dietary pattern rich in fiber) on DKD. Wesearched six databases to identify clinical trials that reported fiber intake and renal outcomes(albuminuria, proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) dialysis) in patients with DM.From 1814 studies, 48 papers were fully evaluated. In the end, seven trials (161 patients, aged 58.3years, 49% females) were included. The studies were organized into three categories (vegetarian,Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, and fiber supplement), two evaluatedsupplements and five dietary patterns. Vegetarian diet reduced albuminuria in three trials, two inpatients with type 1 DM and one in patients with type 2 DM; and one study demonstrated a change inthe eGFR in type 1 DM. The individual quality of the studies was low/uncertain. A vegetarian dietarypattern may have a beneficial effect on these renal outcomes. However, the individual effect of theintake of fiber on DKD not was possible to be evaluated.",Carvalho CM; Gross LA; de Azevedo MJ; Viana LV,Nutrients,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30736343/,0,1,0,0,0,0
30684085,New Areas of Interest: Is There a Role for Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation in Patients With Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease?,"Summarize studies on omega-3 fatty acids in prevention of albuminuria in subjects with diabetes. Several small, short-term trials suggested benefit on albuminuria in subjects with diabetes; however, results were not definitive. Welty et al. showed that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) for 1 year slowed progression of early-stage albuminuria in subjects with diabetes with clinical coronary artery disease on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker, the majority of whom had an albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) < 30 μg/mg. Moreover, significantly more (3-fold) subjects on EPA and DHA had a decrease in ACR compared to control, and three on EPA and DHA had a change in category from > 30 μg/mg to < 30 μg/mg, whereas no controls did. Potential mechanisms for benefit are discussed. These results suggest that there is benefit and perhaps even reversal of albuminuria with EPA and DHA at an early stage of disease in those with ACR < 30 μg/mg and those with microalbuminuria (ACR > 30).",Welty FK,Current diabetes reports,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30684085/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30684032,Magnesium and health outcomes: an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational and intervention studies.,"To map and grade all health outcomes associated with magnesium (Mg) intake and supplementation using an umbrella review. Umbrella review of systematic reviews with meta-analyses of observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using placebo/no intervention as control group. We assessed meta-analyses of observational studies based on random-effect summary effect sizes and their p values, 95% prediction intervals, heterogeneity, small-study effects and excess significance. For meta-analyses of RCTs, outcomes with a random-effect p value < 0.005 and a high-GRADE assessment were classified as strong evidence. From 2048 abstracts, 16 meta-analyses and 55 independent outcomes were included (36 in RCTs and 19 in observational studies). In RCTs of Mg versus placebo/no active treatment, 12 over 36 outcomes reported significant results (p < 0.05). A strong evidence for decreased need for hospitalization in pregnancy and for decreased risk of frequency and intensity of migraine relapses in people with migraine was observed using the GRADE assessment. In observational studies, 9/19 outcomes were significant (p < 0.05). However, only one outcome presented highly suggestive evidence (lower incidence of type 2 diabetes in people with higher Mg intake at baseline) and one suggestive (lower incidence of stroke associated with higher Mg intake at baseline). Strong evidence according to the GRADE suggests that Mg supplementation can decrease the risk of hospitalization in pregnant women and reduce the intensity/frequency of migraine. Higher Mg intake is associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes and stroke with highly suggestive and suggestive evidence, respectively, in observational studies.",Veronese N; Demurtas J; Pesolillo G; Celotto S; Barnini T; Calusi G; Caruso MG; Notarnicola M; Reddavide R; Stubbs B; Solmi M; Maggi S; Vaona A; Firth J; Smith L; Koyanagi A; Dominguez L; Barbagallo M,European journal of nutrition,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30684032/,0,1,0,1,0,0
30683434,Limited evidence for a beneficial effect of vitamin C supplementation on biomarkers of cardiovascular diseases: an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.,"Vitamin C is an essential nutrient with important antioxidant properties. Higher vitamin C intake appears to be associated with positive effects on cardiovascular risk factors in cohort studies, whereas large randomized controlled clinical trials did not confirm the benefits of supplemental vitamin C on cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. In this overview of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, an ""umbrella review,"" we investigated the effects of vitamin C supplementation on biomarkers of cardiovascular risk, that is, arterial stiffness, blood pressure, endothelial function, glycemic control, and lipid profile. In addition, we assessed the strength of the evidence and the methodological qualities of available studies. Two independent investigators searched 4 databases (Medline, Embase, Scopus, and The Cochrane Library databases) from inception until February 2018. After full text examination, 10 systematic reviews and meta-analyses were included in the umbrella review which included 6409 participants. Three systematic reviews investigated the effects of vitamin C on endothelial function with contrasting results (2 reviews reported a significant effect, and all 3 showed a high heterogeneity [I<sup>2</sup>> 50%]); 1 systematic review reported significant improvement for each of the following risk factors: blood pressure, and blood concentrations of glucose, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. There were no overall effects of vitamin C on arterial stiffness and blood concentration of insulin, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but subgroup analyses revealed some evidence for significant improvements in subpopulations with higher body mass index, higher plasma concentrations of glucose or cholesterol, and low plasma concentration of vitamin C. Results from this umbrella review emphasize the weakness of the current evidence base about effects of vitamin C supplementation on markers of CVD risk. There is limited evidence that some population subgroups (older people, the obese, those with lower vitamin C status at baseline, and those at higher CVD risk) may be more responsive to vitamin C supplementation and offer opportunities for tailored nutritional interventions to improve cardiometabolic health.

30668615,Modulation of the Gut Microbiota by Resistant Starch as a Treatment of Chronic Kidney Diseases: Evidence of Efficacy and Mechanistic Insights.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been associated with changes in gut microbial ecology, or ""dysbiosis,"" which may contribute to disease progression. Recent studies have focused on dietary approaches to favorably alter the composition of the gut microbial communities as a treatment method in CKD. Resistant starch (RS), a prebiotic that promotes proliferation of gut bacteria such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, increases the production of metabolites including short-chain fatty acids, which confer a number of health-promoting benefits. However, there is a lack of mechanistic insight into how these metabolites can positively influence renal health. Emerging evidence shows that microbiota-derived metabolites can regulate the incretin axis and mitigate inflammation via expansion of regulatory T cells. Studies from animal models and patients with CKD show that RS supplementation attenuates the concentrations of uremic retention solutes, including indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate. Here, we present the current state of knowledge linking the microbiome to CKD, we explore the efficacy of RS in animal models of CKD and in humans with the condition, and we discuss how RS supplementation could be a promising dietary approach for slowing CKD progression.",Snelson M; Kellow NJ; Coughlan MT,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30668615/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30666982,Prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in India & way forward.,"Deficiency of vitamin D or hypovitaminosis D is widespread irrespective of age, gender, race and geography and has emerged as an important area of research. Vitamin D deficiency may lead to osteoporosis (osteomalacia in adults and rickets in children) along with calcium deficiency. Its deficiency is linked with low bone mass, weakness of muscles and increased risk of fracture. However, further research is needed to link deficiency of vitamin D with extra-skeletal consequences such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, infections and autoimmune disorders. The causes of vitamin D deficiency include length and timing of sun exposure, amount of skin exposed, latitude, season, level of pollution in atmosphere, clothing, skin pigmentation, application of sunscreen, dietary factors and genetic factors. The primary source is sunlight, and the dietary sources include animal products such as fatty fish, food items fortified with vitamin D and supplements. Different cut-offs have been used to define hypovitaminosis D and its severity in different studies. Based on the findings from some Indian studies, a high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D was observed among different age groups. Hypovitaminosis D ranged from 84.9 to 100 per cent among school-going children, 42 to 74 per cent among pregnant women, 44.3 to 66.7 per cent among infants, 70 to 81.1 per cent among lactating mothers and 30 to 91.2 per cent among adults. To tackle the problem of hypovitaminosis D in India, vitamin D fortification in staple foods, supplementation of vitamin D along with calcium, inclusion of local fortified food items in supplementary nutrition programmes launched by the government, cooperation from stakeholders from food industry and creating awareness among physicians and the general population may help in combating the problem to some extent.",Kamboj P; Dwivedi S; Toteja GS,The Indian journal of medical research,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30666982/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30648267,Antiaging effects of bioactive molecules isolated from plants and fungi.,"Aging is influenced by many lifestyle choices that are under human control, including nutrition and exercise. The most effective known antiaging intervention consists of calorie restriction (CR), which increases lifespan in yeasts, worms, fruit flies, mice, and nonhuman primates. CR also improves healthspan by preventing the development of various aging-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neurodegeneration. Many compounds isolated from plants and fungi prolong lifespan and prevent age-related diseases in model organisms. These plant and fungal compounds modulate the same cellular and physiological pathways as CR, including those involving insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1, mammalian target of rapamycin, and sirtuins. Modulation of these aging-related pathways results in the activation of various cellular processes such as autophagy, DNA repair, and neutralization of reactive oxygen species. Together, these cellular processes are believed to delay aging and prevent chronic diseases by improving bodily functions and stress resistance. We review here the mechanisms of action of plant and fungal molecules possessing antiaging properties and discuss the possibilities and challenges associated with the development of antiaging compounds isolated from natural products.",Martel J; Ojcius DM; Ko YF; Chang CJ; Young JD,Medicinal research reviews,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30648267/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30646503,Nutraceutical and Medicinal Potential of the <i>Morus</i> Species in Metabolic Dysfunctions.,"Many populations use medicinal plants as a therapeutic treatment, due to their lower cost and greater access. Among the plant species used for medicinal purposes are those of the genus <i>Morus</i>. The most known species are <i>Morus alba</i>, <i>rubra</i>, and <i>nigra.</i> This review aims to collect data from the literature, predominantly from cell and animal studies, which presents a possible nutraceutical and medicinal potential of the species <i>Morus</i> for use in metabolic dysfunctions. The fruits and leaves of mulberry are used for therapeutic purposes. For scientific confirmation of these effects, they were studied for laxative properties, antibacterial activity, anti-atherogenic activity, and hepatoprotective function. Furthermore, the genus <i>Morus</i> is recognized for the treatment and prevention of diabetes mellitus, through its hypoglycemic action. It may also provide health benefits through immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and anti-nociceptive effects. It has been found that the <i>Morus</i> species have phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and anthocyanins that act as important antioxidants and promote beneficial effects on human health. These phytochemical compounds differ among species. Blackberry (<i>Morus nigra</i>) are rich in flavonoids, while the white mulberry (<i>Morus alba</i>) has low concentrations of flavonoids and anthocyanins. In addition, another important factor is to ensure a complete exemption of toxic risks in the use of medicinal plants for the treatment of diseases. Studies have shown no toxic effects by the administration of extracts of <i>Morus</i> species. Thus, the mulberry tree presents nutraceutical potential. It is therefore a promising alternative for medicinal products based on medicinal plants.",Rodrigues EL; Marcelino G; Silva GT; Figueiredo PS; Garcez WS; Corsino J; Guimarães RCA; Freitas KC,International journal of molecular sciences,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30646503/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30644763,Future perspectives of the pharmacological management of diabetic dyslipidemia.,"Diabetic dyslipidemia is frequent among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and is characterized by an increase in triglycerides (TGs), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and small-dense (atherogenic) particles, and by a decrease in low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein (Apo) A1 that are strongly related to insulin resistance. The increased flux of free fatty acids from adipose tissue to the liver aggravates hepatic insulin resistance and promotes all of aspects of the dyslipidemic state. Areas covered: Statins are the first-line agents for treatment while other lipid-lowering drugs (ezetimibe, fibrate and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) or novel anti-diabetic agents (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is), glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is)) or nutraceuticals (berberine, omega 3 fatty acid, red yeast rice) can be used alone or in combination. Expert commentary: In patients with T2DM, lipid abnormalities should be identified and treated as part of the overall diabetic treatment, in order to prevent cardiovascular disease. The choice of drugs to be used is mainly based on the lipid profile and on the characteristic lipoprotein abnormalities; the use of new drugs for the treatment of hyperglycemia and lipids alteration in these patients can improve diabetic dyslipidemia.",Patti AM; Giglio RV; Papanas N; Rizzo M; Rizvi AA,Expert review of clinical pharmacology,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30644763/,1,0,0,0,0,0

30617143,Should Viscous Fiber Supplements Be Considered in Diabetes Control? Results From a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggests that viscous dietary fiber may offer beneficial effects on glycemic control and, thus, an improved cardiovascular disease risk profile. Our purpose was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs to synthesize the therapeutic effect of viscous fiber supplementation on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched through 15 June 2018. We included RCTs ≥3 weeks in duration that assessed the effects of viscous fiber on markers of glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. Two independent reviewers extracted data. Data were pooled using the generic inverse variance method and expressed as mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs. Heterogeneity was assessed (Cochran <i>Q</i> statistic) and quantified (<i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> statistic). The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to evaluate the overall certainty of the evidence. We identified 28 eligible trial comparisons (<i>n</i> = 1,394). Viscous fiber at a median dose of ∼13.1 g/day significantly reduced HbA<sub>1c</sub> (MD -0.58% [95% CI -0.88, -0.28]; <i>P</i> = 0.0002), fasting blood glucose (MD -0.82 mmol/L [95% CI -1.32, -0.31]; <i>P</i> = 0.001), and HOMA-insulin resistance (IR) (MD -1.89 [95% CI -3.45, -0.33]; <i>P</i> = 0.02) compared with control and in addition to standard of care. The certainty of evidence was graded moderate for HbA<sub>1c</sub>, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and HOMA-IR and low for fructosamine. Viscous fiber supplements improve conventional markers of glycemic control beyond usual care and should be considered in the management of type 2 diabetes.",Jovanovski E; Khayyat R; Zurbau A; Komishon A; Mazhar N; Sievenpiper JL; Blanco Mejia S; Ho HVT; Li D; Jenkins AL; Duvnjak L; Vuksan V,Diabetes care,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30617143/,0,1,0,1,0,0
30615110,Effect of folate supplementation on insulin sensitivity and type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Various mechanisms link higher total homocysteine to higher insulin resistance (IR) and risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Folate supplementation is recognized as a way to lower homocysteine. However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) show inconsistent results on IR and T2D outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of folate supplementation on IR and T2D outcomes. We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE and prior systematic reviews and meta-analyses and identified 29 RCTs (22,250 participants) that assessed the effect of placebo-controlled folate supplementation alone or in combination with other B vitamins on fasting glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), or risk of T2D. The meta-analysis was conducted using both random- and fixed-effects models to calculate weighted mean differences (WMDs) or risk ratios with 95% CIs. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on intervention type (folate alone or in combination with other B vitamins), as well as analysis based on population characteristics, duration, dose, and change in homocysteine. When compared with placebo, folate supplementation lowered fasting insulin (WMD: -13.47 pmol/L; 95% CI: -21.41, -5.53 pmol/L; P < 0.001) and HOMA-IR (WMD: -0.57 units; 95% CI: -0.76, -0.37 units; P < 0.0001), but no overall effects were observed for fasting glucose or HbA1c. Heterogeneity was low in all meta-analyses, and subgroup analysis showed no signs of effect modification except for change in homocysteine, with the most pronounced effects in trials with a change of >2.5 µmol/L. Changes in homocysteine after folate supplementation correlated with changes in fasting glucose (β = 0.07; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.14; P = 0.025) and HbA1c (β = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.85; P = 0.02). Only 2 studies examined folate supplementation on risk of T2D, and they found no change in RR (pooled RR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.80, 1.04; P = 0.16). Folate supplementation might be beneficial for glucose homeostasis and lowering IR, but at present there are insufficient data to conclusively determine the effect on development of T2D.

30614268,Potential nutraceutical and food additive properties and risks of coffee: a comprehensive overview.,"Coffee is a composite mixture of more than a thousand diverse phytochemicals like alkaloids, phenolic compounds, vitamins, carbohydrates, lipids, minerals and nitrogenous compounds. Coffee has multifunctional properties as a food additive and nutraceutical. As a nutraceutical, coffee has anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, antidyslipidemic, anti-obesity, type-2 diabetes mellitus (DM), and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which can serve for the treatment and prevention of metabolic syndrome and associated disorders. On the other hand, as a food additive, coffee has antimicrobial activity against a wide range of microorganisms, inhibits lipid peroxidation (LPO), and can function as a prebiotic. The outcomes of different studies also revealed that coffee intake may reduce the incidence of numerous chronic diseases, like liver disease, mental health, and it also overcomes the all-cause mortality, and suicidal risks. In some studies, high intake of coffee is linked to increase CVD risk factors, like cholesterol, plasma homocysteine and blood pressure (BP). There is also a little evidence that associated the coffee consumption with increased risk of lung tumors in smokers. Among adults who consume the moderate amount of coffee, there is slight indication of health hazards with strong indicators of health benefits. Moreover, existing literature suggests that it may be cautious for pregnant women to eliminate the chances of miscarriages and impaired fetal growth. The primary purpose of this narrative review is to provide an overview of the findings of the positive impacts and risks of coffee consumption on human health. In conclusion, to date, the best available evidence from research indicates that drinking coffee up to 3-4 cups/day provides health benefits for most people.",Saeed M; Naveed M; BiBi J; Ali Kamboh A; Phil L; Chao S,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30614268/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30600497,Nutritional Effects of Zinc on Metabolic Syndrome and Type 2 Diabetes: Mechanisms and Main Findings in Human Studies.,"Zinc (Zn) plays crucial roles in mammalian metabolism. There is increasing interest about the potential beneficial effects of Zn on the prevention or treatment of non-communicable diseases. This review critically analyzes the information related to the role of Zn on the metabolic syndrome (MetS) as well as type 2 diabetes (T2D), and summarizes the biological basis of these potential effects of Zn. There are several mechanisms by which Zn may help to prevent the development or progression of MetS and T2D, respectively. Zn is involved in both insulin secretion and action in peripheral tissues. Specifically, Zn has insulin-mimetic properties that increase the activity of the insulin signaling pathway. Zn modulates long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids levels through its action on the absorption of essential fatty acids in the intestine and its subsequent desaturation. Zn is also involved in both the assembly of chylomicrons and lipoproteins as well as their clearance, and thus, plays a role in lipolysis regulation. Finally, Zn has been found to play a role in redox metabolism, and in turn, on blood pressure. The evidence related to the association between Zn status and occurrence of MetS is inconsistent. Although there are several studies reporting an inverse relationship between Zn status or dietary Zn intake and MetS prevalence, others found a direct relationship between Zn status and MetS prevalence. Intervention studies also provide confusing information about this issue, making it hard to reach firm conclusions. Zn as part of the treatment for patients with T2D has been shown to have positive responses in terms of glucose control outcomes, but only among those with Zn deficiency.",Ruz M; Carrasco F; Rojas P; Basfi-Fer K; Hernández MC; Pérez A,Biological trace element research,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30600497/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Several products and techniques have been adopted to alleviate infertility condition, but the most recent and promising result was obtained through supplementation of probiotics. Continuous research on probiotics opened up a previously unknown area of its role as a modern medicine in improving fertility. New research findings suggest a profertility effect of several probiotics strains through alleviation of various fertility based disorders and modulation of the immune system. The goal of this review is to cover all the major fertility based disorders, particularly highlighting the role of probiotics in improving fertility through alleviation of such fertility based disorders.",Mohapatra SK; Ranvir S; Nikam P; David J,Critical reviews in biomedical engineering,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32422032/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30597307,Probiotic supplements might not be universally-effective and safe: A review.,"Last few decades have witnessed the unprecedented growth in the application of probiotics for promoting the general gut health as well as their inception as biotherapeutics to alleviate certain clinical disorders related to dysbiosis. While numerous studies have substantiated the health-restoring potentials for a restricted group of microbial species, the marketed extrapolation of a similar probiotic label to a large number of partially characterized microbial formulations seems biased. In particular, the individuals under neonatal stages and/or those with some clinical conditions including malignancies, leaky gut, diabetes mellitus, and post-organ transplant convalescence likely fail to reap the benefits of probiotics. Further exacerbating the conditions, some probiotic strains might take advantage of the weak immunity in these vulnerable groups and turn into opportunistic pathogens engendering life-threatening pneumonia, endocarditis, and sepsis. Moreover, the unregulated and rampant use of probiotics potentially carry the risk of plasmid-mediated antibiotic resistance transfer to the gut infectious pathogens. In this review, we discuss the safety perspectives of probiotics and their therapeutic interventions in certain at-risk population groups. The embodied arguments and hypotheses certainly will shed light on the fact why probiotic usage should be treated with caution.",Kothari D; Patel S; Kim SK,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30597307/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30592686,Equol Decreases Hot Flashes in Postmenopausal Women: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials.,"Soy isoflavones may benefit some, but not all, menopausal women, and the ability of the women to produce equol may be the major determinant of effectiveness. We assessed the efficacy of soy isoflavones and equol for alleviating menopausal symptoms, especially vasomotor symptoms, in postmenopausal women who were equol producers and nonproducers by using systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). We searched 12 English, Korean, and Chinese language scientific and medical databases. We selected all available RCTs that assessed the effect of equol, either equol itself or soy isoflavone in equol producers, on menopausal symptoms in peri- or postmenopausal women. The primary outcome was the effect on hot flashes. The severity of hot flashes was determined by the scores, and sensitivity and risk of bias analyses were conducted. Other outcomes of the review, but not meta-analysis, included depression and adverse events. Six studies (779 total subjects) met all criteria for the systematic review, 5 of those could be included in the meta-analysis (728 total subjects). Two studies included in the meta-analysis reported no statistically significant benefits of equol; the other three did report significant benefits of equol. Meta-analysis revealed a significant benefit of equol for lowering hot flash scores and revealed a generally low risk of bias. In conclusion, this study found that supplementing equol to equol nonproducers significantly lowered the incidence and/or severity of hot flashes in menopausal women.",Daily JW; Ko BS; Ryuk J; Liu M; Zhang W; Park S,Journal of medicinal food,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30592686/,0,1,0,1,0,0
30577559,Association of l-Arginine Supplementation with Markers of Endothelial Function in Patients with Cardiovascular or Metabolic Disorders: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"l-Arginine supplementation is a potential therapy for treating cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. However, the use of distinct l-arginine sources, intervened populations, and treatment regimens may have yielded confusion about their efficacy. This research constitutes a systematic review and meta-analysis summarizing the effects of l-arginine supplementation compared to placebo in individuals with cardiovascular disease (CVD), obesity, or diabetes. Eligibility criteria included randomized clinical trials and interventions based on oral supplementation of l-arginine with a minimum duration of three days; comparison groups consisted of individuals with the same disease condition receiving an oral placebo substance. The primary outcome was flow-mediated dilation, and secondary outcomes were nitrite/nitrate (NOx) rate and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). Statistical heterogeneity among studies included in the meta-analyses was assessed using the inconsistency index (I2). Fifty-four full-text articles from 3761 retrieved references were assessed for eligibility. After exclusions, 13 studies were included for data extraction. There was no difference in blood flow after post-ischemic hyperemia between the supplementation of l-arginine and placebo groups before and after the intervention period (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.30; 95% confidence intervals (CIs) = -0.85 to 1.46; I2 = 96%). Sensitivity analysis showed decreased heterogeneity when the studies that most favor arginine and placebo were removed, and positive results in favor of arginine supplementation were found (SMD = 0.59; 95% CIs = 0.10 to 1.08; I2 = 75%). No difference was found in meta-analytical estimates of NOx and ADMA responses between arginine or placebo treatments. Overall, the results indicated that oral l-arginine supplementation was not associated with improvements on selected variables in these patients (PROSPERO Registration: CRD42017077289).",Rodrigues-Krause J; Krause M; Rocha IMGD; Umpierre D; Fayh APT,Nutrients,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30577559/,0,1,0,1,0,0
30574856,Association of Low Vitamin D with Complications of HIV and AIDS: A literature Review.,"With the advent of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the survival of HIV patients has improved dramatically, but the complications of the disease and treatment have become an important issue in the management of HIV patients. Vitamin-D deficiency is common in HIV patients. Low vitamin-D is associated with different comorbidities in the HIV uninfected general population. In this review, we first briefly describe vitamin D synthesis and mechanism of action and we focus on the epidemiological and clinical data dealing with the relationship between vitamin D deficiency in HIV infection with several comorbidities which has been found to be increasingly common in patients living with HIV infection. We searched the PubMed database using the keywords ""HIV,"" ""vitamin D"" and other common disorders or conditions that are relatively common in HIV infection. The other conditions included in the search were osteoporosis and fracture, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and insulin resistance, active tuberculosis, hepatitis-C co-infection, and HIV disease progression. Articles presenting original data as well as systematic reviews and met analysis related to HIV population were included in our analysis. Vitamin-D deficiency seems to be associated with several adverse outcomes in HIV patients but a definite cause and effect relationship with vitamin-D is yet to be confirmed in most of the cases. However, the literature supporting the efficacy of vitamin-D supplementation is lacking.",Chokuda E; Reynolds C; Das S,Infectious disorders drug targets,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30574856/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30551349,Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS): Suggestions for a nutritional treatment in the therapeutic approach.,"Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is known as a multi-systemic and complex illness, which induces fatigue and long-term disability in educational, occupational, social, or personal activities. The diagnosis of this disease is difficult, due to lacking a proper and suited diagnostic laboratory test, besides to its multifaceted symptoms. Numerous factors, including environmental and immunological issues, and a large spectrum of CFS symptoms, have recently been reported. In this review, we focus on the nutritional intervention in CFS, discussing the many immunological, environmental, and nutritional aspects currently investigated about this disease. Changes in immunoglobulin levels, cytokine proﬁles and B- and T- cell phenotype and declined cytotoxicity of natural killer cells, are commonly reported features of immune dysregulation in CFS. Also, some nutrient deficiencies (vitamin C, vitamin B complex, sodium, magnesium, zinc, folic acid, l-carnitine, l-tryptophan, essential fatty acids, and coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub>) appear to be important in the severity and exacerbation of CFS symptoms.

30545280,Omega-3 PUFAs and vitamin D co-supplementation as a safe-effective therapeutic approach for core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder: case report and literature review.,"<b>Introduction:</b> Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by abnormal development of cognitive, social, and communicative skills. Although ASD aetiology and pathophysiology are still unclear, various nutritional factors have been investigated as potential risk factors for ASD development, including omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and vitamin D deficiency. In fact, both omega-3 PUFAs and vitamin D are important for brain development and function. <b>Case report:</b> Herein, we report the case of a 23-year-old young adult male with autism who was referred to our Unit due to a 12-month history of cyclic episodes of restlessness, agitation, irritability, oppositional and self-injurious behaviours. Laboratory tests documented a markedly altered omega-6/omega-3 balance, along with a vitamin D deficiency, as assessed by serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Omega-3 and vitamin D co-supplementation was therefore started, with remarkable improvements in ASD symptoms throughout a 24-month follow-up period. A brief review of the literature for interventional studies evaluating the efficacy of omega-3 or vitamin D supplementation for the treatment of ASD-related symptoms is also provided. <b>Conclusion:</b> To our knowledge, this is the first case reporting remarkable beneficial effects on ASD symptoms deriving from omega-3 and vitamin D combination therapy. This case report suggests omega-3 and vitamin D co-supplementation as a potential safe-effective therapeutic strategy to treat core symptoms of ASD. However, larger studies are needed to evaluate the real efficacy of such therapeutic approach in a broader sample of ASD patients.",Infante M; Sears B; Rizzo AM; Mariani Cerati D; Caprio M; Ricordi C; Fabbri A,Nutritional neuroscience,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30545280/,1,0,0,0,0,1
30531472,The gut microbiota and blood pressure in experimental models.,"To summarize evidence supporting that microorganisms colonizing our gastrointestinal tract, collectively known as the gut microbiota, are implicated in the development and maintenance of hypertension in experimental models. The use of gnotobiotic (germ-free) mice has been essential for advancement in this area: they develop higher blood pressure (BP) if they receive faecal transplants from hypertensive patients compared to normotensive donors, and germ-free mice have a blunted response to angiotensin II. Experimental hypertension is consistently accompanied by changes in the composition of the gut microbiota. This is combined with a shift in microbial diversity and the deterioration of the gut epithelial barrier commonly referred to as gut dysbiosis. Restoration of normal gut biosis and microbiota alleviates and protects against the development of hypertension in both genetic and pharmacological models. This has been achieved by the use of antibiotics, faecal transplants between normotensive and hypertensive strains, and the use of prebiotics (i.e. food stuff that feeds the microbiota), probiotics (i.e. live bacteria) and gut metabolites (i.e. short-chain fatty acids). Research into experimental hypertension supports that the gut microbiota contributes to the regulation of BP. Manipulation of the microbiota might represent a new tool to prevent hypertension.",Jama HA; Kaye DM; Marques FZ,Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30531472/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30480773,Omega-3 fatty acid addition during pregnancy.,"Higher intakes of foods containing omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), such as fish, during pregnancy have been associated with longer gestations and improved perinatal outcomes. This is an update of a review that was first published in 2006. To assess the effects of omega-3 LCPUFA, as supplements or as dietary additions, during pregnancy on maternal, perinatal, and neonatal outcomes and longer-term outcomes for mother and child. For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (16 August 2018), and reference lists of retrieved studies. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing omega-3 fatty acids (as supplements or as foods, stand-alone interventions, or with a co-intervention) during pregnancy with placebo or no omega-3, and studies or study arms directly comparing omega-3 LCPUFA doses or types. Trials published in abstract form were eligible for inclusion. Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, assessed risk of bias in trials and assessed quality of evidence for prespecified birth/infant, maternal, child/adult and health service outcomes using the GRADE approach. In this update, we included 70 RCTs (involving 19,927 women at low, mixed or high risk of poor pregnancy outcomes) which compared omega-3 LCPUFA interventions (supplements and food) compared with placebo or no omega-3. Overall study-level risk of bias was mixed, with selection and performance bias mostly at low risk, but there was high risk of attrition bias in some trials. Most trials were conducted in upper-middle or high-income countries; and nearly half the trials included women at increased/high risk for factors which might increase the risk of adverse maternal and birth outcomes.Preterm birth < 37 weeks (13.4% versus 11.9%; risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 0.97; 26 RCTs, 10,304 participants; high-quality evidence) and early preterm birth < 34 weeks (4.6% versus 2.7%; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.77; 9 RCTs, 5204 participants; high-quality evidence) were both lower in women who received omega-3 LCPUFA compared with no omega-3. Prolonged gestation > 42 weeks was probably increased from 1.6% to 2.6% in women who received omega-3 LCPUFA compared with no omega-3 (RR 1.61 95% CI 1.11 to 2.33; 5141 participants; 6 RCTs; moderate-quality evidence).For infants, there was a possibly reduced risk of perinatal death (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.03; 10 RCTs, 7416 participants; moderate-quality evidence: 62/3715 versus 83/3701 infants) and possibly fewer neonatal care admissions (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.03; 9 RCTs, 6920 participants; moderate-quality evidence - 483/3475 infants versus 519/3445 infants). There was a reduced risk of low birthweight (LBW) babies (15.6% versus 14%; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.99; 15 trials, 8449 participants; high-quality evidence); but a possible small increase in large-for-gestational age (LGA) babies (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.36; 6 RCTs, 3722 participants; moderate-quality evidence, for omega-3 LCPUFA compared with no omega-3. Little or no difference in small-for-gestational age or intrauterine growth restriction (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.13; 8 RCTs, 6907 participants; moderate-quality evidence) was seen.For the maternal outcomes, there is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of omega-3 on induction post-term (average RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.98; 3 trials, 2900 participants; low-quality evidence), maternal serious adverse events (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.72; 2 trials, 2690 participants; low-quality evidence), maternal admission to intensive care (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.63; 2 trials, 2458 participants; low-quality evidence), or postnatal depression (average RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.77; 2 trials, 2431 participants; low-quality evidence). Mean gestational length was greater in women who received omega-3 LCPUFA (mean difference (MD) 1.67 days, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.39; 41 trials, 12,517 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and pre-eclampsia may possibly be reduced with omega-3 LCPUFA (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.01; 20 trials, 8306 participants; low-quality evidence).For the child/adult outcomes, very few differences between antenatal omega-3 LCPUFA supplementation and no omega-3 were observed in cognition, IQ, vision, other neurodevelopment and growth outcomes, language and behaviour (mostly low-quality to very low-quality evidence). The effect of omega-3 LCPUFA on body mass index at 19 years (MD 0, 95% CI -0.83 to 0.83; 1 trial, 243 participants; very low-quality evidence) was uncertain. No data were reported for development of diabetes in the children of study participants. In the overall analysis, preterm birth < 37 weeks and early preterm birth < 34 weeks were reduced in women receiving omega-3 LCPUFA compared with no omega-3. There was a possibly reduced risk of perinatal death and of neonatal care admission, a reduced risk of LBW babies; and possibly a small increased risk of LGA babies with omega-3 LCPUFA.For our GRADE quality assessments, we assessed most of the important perinatal outcomes as high-quality (e.g. preterm birth) or moderate-quality evidence (e.g. perinatal death). For the other outcome domains (maternal, child/adult and health service outcomes) GRADE ratings ranged from moderate to very low, with over half rated as low. Reasons for downgrading across the domain were mostly due to design limitations and imprecision.Omega-3 LCPUFA supplementation during pregnancy is an effective strategy for reducing the incidence of preterm birth, although it probably increases the incidence of post-term pregnancies. More studies comparing omega-3 LCPUFA and placebo (to establish causality in relation to preterm birth) are not needed at this stage. A further 23 ongoing trials are still to report on over 5000 women, so no more RCTs are needed that compare omega-3 LCPUFA against placebo or no intervention. However, further follow-up of completed trials is needed to assess longer-term outcomes for mother and child, to improve understanding of metabolic, growth and neurodevelopment pathways in particular, and to establish if, and how, outcomes vary by different types of omega-3 LCPUFA, timing and doses; or by characteristics of women.",Middleton P; Gomersall JC; Gould JF; Shepherd E; Olsen SF; Makrides M,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30480773/,0,1,0,1,0,1
30462180,"Associations between Phytoestrogens, Glucose Homeostasis, and Risk of Diabetes in Women: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","Phytoestrogens might have advantageous effects on diabetes in women. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effect of phytoestrogens on glucose homeostasis and the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) among women. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective observational studies that assessed associations of phytoestrogens (supplementation, dietary intake, or biomarkers) with fasting glucose or insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), or with the risk of T2D were included. We identified 18 RCTs (n = 1687 individuals) investigating the effect of phytoestrogen supplementation on glucose homeostasis and 9 prospective population-based studies (n = 212,796 individuals) examining the association between phytoestrogen intake and the risk of T2D. Compared with placebo, phytoestrogen supplementation resulted in improvements in fasting glucose and HOMA-IR: the pooled mean differences of changes were -0.12 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.20, -0.03 mmol/L) and -0.24 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.45, -0.03 mmol/L), respectively. Although there was no significant decrease in insulin concentrations with overall phytoestrogen supplementation, the pooled mean difference in changes was -0.99 pmol/L (95% CI: -4.65, 2.68 pmol/L). However, the results of RCTs varied by type of phytoestrogens: soy-derived isoflavones and genistein improved glucose homeostasis, whereas isoflavone mix and daidzein had no effect or were associated with an adverse glycemic profile. Higher dietary phytoestrogen intake was associated with a 10% lower risk of developing T2D in observational studies (pooled RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.85, 0.96; for the highest compared with the lowest quantiles). Results were similar when the analyses were restricted to only medium- and high-quality studies. Overall, phytoestrogens may have a positive influence on glycemia and could be used for diabetes prevention in women. However, for some individual types of phytoestrogens, such as mixed isoflavones, caution is needed in recommending their use in women, because their use could lead to an adverse glycemic profile in women.",Glisic M; Kastrati N; Gonzalez-Jaramillo V; Bramer WM; Ahmadizar F; Chowdhury R; Danser AJ; Roks AJ; Voortman T; Franco OH; Muka T,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30462180/,0,1,0,1,0,0

Despite a large number of experimental and observational studies supporting a role for vitamin D in these pathologies, randomized controlled trials have reported little to no effect of vitamin D supplementation in the prevention or treatment of these disorders, although some results remain ambiguous. Polymorphisms in genes related to vitamin D metabolism, particularly in the vitamin D receptor and binding protein and the metabolizing enzyme 1-α-hydroxylase, have emerged as potential contributors to these divergent results. It is now becoming increasingly recognized that the effects and potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation may vary by several factors including vitamin D deficiency status, ethnicity and/or the presence of genetic variants, which affect individual responses to supplementation. However, these factors have seldom been explored in the available literature. Future trials should consider inter-individual differences and, in particular, should aim to clarify whether certain subgroups of individuals may benefit from vitamin D supplementation in the context of cardiometabolic health.",Marquina C; Mousa A; Scragg R; de Courten B,Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30450683/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30447293,The effect of vitamin D supplementation on oxidative stress parameters: A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials.,"Recent studies have shown that vitamin D supplementation beneficially decreases oxidative stress (OS) parameters; however, there is no consensus on this subject. In this systematic review and meta-analysis we aimed to investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on OS parameters. We searched electronic databases including Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane Library up to July 2018 without any language restriction. Trials were reviewed using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) and Cochrane handbook. To compare the effects of vitamin D with placebo, standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using random effects model. Across thirteen clinical trials, we found that vitamin D supplementation increased serum levels of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (SMD: 0.54 mmol/L, 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.79; I<sup>2</sup> = 65.4%, P = 0.001) and glutathione (GSH) (SMD: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.11 to 0.54, P = 0.003; I<sup>2</sup> = 61.2%, P = 0.001).

30414469,Dietary polyphenols and their roles in fat browning.,"Discovery of the presence of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in newborn babies and adult humans, especially constitutively active brown fat or inducible beige fat, has led to the investigation of strategies employing BAT aimed at the development of novel therapeutic avenues for combating obesity and diabetes. Such antiobesity therapeutic tools include pharmaceutical and nutraceutical dietary polyphenols. Although there have been emerging notable advances in knowledge of and an increased amount of research related to brown and beige adipocyte developmental lineages and transcriptional regulators, current knowledge regarding whether and how food factors and environmental modifiers of BAT influence thermogenesis has not been extensively investigated. Therefore, in this review, we summarized recent updates on the exploration of dietary polyphenols while paying attention to the activation of BAT and thermogenesis. Specifically, we summarized findings pertaining to BAT metabolism, white adipose tissue (WAT) browning and thermogenic function of polyphenols (e.g., flavan-3-ols, green tea catechins, resveratrol, capsaicin/capsinoids, curcumin, thymol, chrysin, quercetin and berberine) that may foster a relatively safe and effective therapeutic option to improve metabolic health. We also deciphered the underlying proposed mechanisms through which these dietary polyphenols facilitate BAT activity and WAT browning. Characterization of thermogenic dietary factors may offer novel insight enabling revision of nutritional intervention strategies aimed at obesity and diabetes prevention and management. Moreover, identification of polyphenolic dietary factors among plant-derived natural compounds may provide information that facilitates nutritional intervention strategies against obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome.",Silvester AJ; Aseer KR; Yun JW,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30414469/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We searched PUBMED, EMBASE and Cochrane library through June 2018 to retrieve and screen published reports for inclusion in the meta-analysis after methodological assessment. Heterogeneity of studies was evaluated using I<sup>2</sup> statistics, while sensitivity analysis and funnel plot were used to evaluate the potential effect of individual studies on the overall estimates and publication bias, respectively, using RevMan 5.3. Eight articles on randomized clinical trial of oral BCAA supplementation, and seven articles on dietary BCAA intake and type 2 diabetes/obesity risks were eligible for inclusion in our meta-analyses. Mean difference and 95% confidence interval (CI) of circulating leucine was 39.65 (3.54, 75.76) µmol/L, P = 0.03 post-BCAA supplementation. Also, OR and 95% CI for higher total BCAA intake and metabolic disorder risks were, 1.32 (1.14, 1.53), P = 0.0003-type 2 diabetes and 0.62 (0.47, 0.82), P = 0.0008-obesity.

30402931,Chemo-preventive and therapeutic effect of the dietary flavonoid kaempferol: A comprehensive review.,"Kaempferol, a natural flavonoid present in several plants, possesses a wide range of therapeutic properties such as antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory. It has a significant role in reducing cancer and can act as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of diseases and ailments such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, oxidative stress, asthma, and microbial contamination disorders. Kaempferol acts through different mechanisms: It induces apoptosis (HeLa cervical cancer cells), decreases cell viability (G2/M phase), downregulates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT (protein kinase B) and human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus-I (HTLV-I) signaling pathways, suppresses protein expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related markers including N-cadherin, E-cadherin, Slug, and Snail, and metastasis-related markers such as matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP-2). Accordingly, the aim of the present review is to collect information pertaining to the effective role of kaempferol against various degenerative disorders, summarize the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antidiabetic, and antiaging effects of kaempferol and to review the progress of recent research and available data on kaempferol as a protective and chemotherapeutic agent against several ailments.",Imran M; Rauf A; Shah ZA; Saeed F; Imran A; Arshad MU; Ahmad B; Bawazeer S; Atif M; Peters DG; Mubarak MS,Phytotherapy research : PTR,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30402931/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30396207,The Effects of Melatonin Supplementation on Glycemic Control: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to clarify the effect of melatonin supplementation on glycemic control. Databases including PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched until July 30th, 2018. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias for included trials. Heterogeneity among included studies was assessed using Cochran's Q test and I-square (I<sup>2</sup>) statistic. Data were pooled using random-effect models and standardized mean difference (MD) was considered as the overall effect size. Twelve trials out of 292 selected reports were identified eligible to be included in current meta-analysis. The pooled findings indicated that melatonin supplementation significantly reduced fasting glucose (SMD=-6.34; 95% CI, -12.28, -0.40; p=0.04; I<sup>2</sup>: 65.0) and increased the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) (SMD=0.01; 95% CI, 0.00, 0.02; p=0.01; I<sup>2</sup>: 0.0). However, melatonin administration did not significantly influence insulin levels (SMD=-1.03; 95% CI, -3.82, 1.77; p=0.47; I<sup>2</sup>: 0.53), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (SMD=-0.34; 95% CI, -1.25, 0.58; p=0.37; I<sup>2</sup>: 0.37) or HbA1c levels (SMD=-0.22; 95% CI, -0.47, 0.03; p=0.08; I<sup>2</sup>: 0.0). In summary, the current meta-analysis showed a promising effect of melatonin supplementation on glycemic control through reducing fasting glucose and increasing QUICKI, yet additional prospective studies are recommended, using higher supplementation doses and longer intervention period, to confirm the impact of melatonin on insulin levels, HOMA-IR and HbA1c.",Doosti-Irani A; Ostadmohammadi V; Mirhosseini N; Mansournia MA; Reiter RJ; Kashanian M; Rahimi M; Razavi M; Asemi Z,Hormone and metabolic research = Hormon- und Stoffwechselforschung = Hormones et metabolisme,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30396207/,0,1,0,1,0,0
30394894,New insights into the anorexia of ageing: from prevention to treatment.,"Undernutrition in older adults is associated with frailty, functional decline, and mortality. The 'anorexia of ageing' is the age-related appetite and weight loss underpinning such undernutrition. This review examines the latest evidence for its prevention and treatment. Existing nutritional therapies for the anorexia of ageing include supporting nutritional intake with fortified food or supplements, including protein, omega-3 fatty acids, multivitamins, and vitamin D. The Mediterranean diet provides high fat intake and nutrient density in a moderate volume of colourful and flavoursome food and is strengthening in evidence for healthy ageing. Studies of the gut microbiome, which potentially regulates normal appetite by acting on the brain-gut communication axis, are pertinent. Utilisation of the genetic profile of individuals to determine nutritional needs is an exciting advancement of the past decade and may become common practice. Prevention or early treatment of the anorexia of ageing in older adults is critical. Latest evidence suggests that once significant weight loss has occurred, aggressive nutritional support may not result in improved outcomes.",Dent E; Hoogendijk EO; Wright ORL,Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30394894/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30388861,Effect of Probiotics on the Glucose Levels of Pregnant Women: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"<i>Background:</i> Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a condition, in which women develop high blood sugar levels during pregnancy without having diabetes. Evidence on the effects of probiotics on the blood glucose levels of women with GDM is inconsistent. <i>Objective:</i> The present study aimed to investigate the effects of probiotics on the blood glucose levels of pregnant women. <i>Methods:</i> Online databases, such as PubMed, Cochrane, and Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published before July 2018. Trials had to meet the inclusion criteria of our study. Methodological quality and risk bias were independently assessed by two reviewers. Data were pooled using a random effects model and were expressed as the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was evaluated and quantified as <i>I</i>². <i>Results:</i> In total, 12 RCTs were included in this study. Studies have shown that the use of probiotics significantly reduced the fasting blood glucose (FBG) level (MD: -0.10 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.19, -0.02), insulin concentration (MD: -2.24 μIU/mL; 95% CI: -3.69, -0.79), Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) score (MD: -0.47; 95% CI: -0.74, -0.21), and Homeostasis model of assessment-estimated β cell function (HOMA-B) score (MD: -20.23; 95% CI: -31.98, -8.49) of pregnant women. In a subgroup analysis, whether the blood glucose-lowering effect of probiotics influenced the diagnosis of pregnant women with GDM was assessed. The results showed that probiotics had significantly reduced the fasting blood glucose (FBG) level (MD: -0.10 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.17, -0.04) and HOMA-IR score (MD: -0.37; 95% CI: -0.72, -0.02) of pregnant women who were not diagnosed with GDM. <i>Conclusion:</i> Probiotics reduce the blood glucose level of pregnant women, especially without GDM diagnosis.

30378500,Nutraceuticals and Diet-based Phytochemicals in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: From Whole Food to Components with Defined Roles and Mechanisms.,"Over the past decades, the development and use of an array of prescription medications have considerably improved the clinical management of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the quality of life of patients. However, as our knowledge of the associated risk factors and approaches to its management increases, the increasing roles of diet and the composition of the diet in the etiology and successful management of diabetes mellitus are being illuminated. Presently, a lot of attention is being given to nutraceuticals and certain phytochemicals that are integral parts of the human diet. It is believed that a clearer understanding of their roles may be crucial to 'non-invasive' or minimallyintrusive management, with regards to daily living of patients. In this review, an overview of nutraceutical components and phytochemicals that may be of benefit, or had been known to be beneficial in diabetes mellitus is given. Also, how the roles of such dietary components are evolving in the management of this disorder is highlighted. Lastly, the obstacles that need to be overcome before nutraceuticals can be considered as options for the clinical management of diabetes mellitus areconsidered. Despite studies that demonstrate their efficacy, no nutraceutical or food-derived compound has been formally adopted as a direct replacement for any class of antidiabetic drugs.",Onaolapo AY; Onaolapo OJ,Current diabetes reviews,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30378500/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30362417,Iron and Vitamin D/Calcium Deficiency after Gastric Bypass: Mechanisms Involved and Strategies to Improve Oral Supplement Disposition.,"Nutritional deficiencies are common following Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB). Aetiology is diverse; including non-compliance, altered diet, unresolved preoperative deficiency and differential degrees of post-operative malabsorption occurring as function of length of bypassed intestine. Iron and calcium/vitamin D deficiency occur in up to 50% of patients following RYGB. Currently, treatment strategies recommend the prescription of oral supplements for those who become deficient. Meanwhile, debate exists regarding the absorption capacity of these post-operatively and their efficacy in treating deficiency. To examine the disposition of oral iron and calcium/vitamin D supplementation following RYGB. A literature review was carried out using PubMed and Embase. Data from the key interventional studies investigating iron and calcium/vitamin D oral supplement absorption and efficacy following RYGB was summarized. Absorption of both iron and vitamin D/calcium is adversely affected following RYGB. Distribution and metabolism may be altered by the predominance of paracellular absorption pathways which promote unregulated influx into the circulatory system. Overall, studies indicate that current supplementation strategies are efficacious to a degree in treating deficiency following RYGB, generally restoration of optimal status is not achieved. Oral supplement disposition is altered following RYGB. As a result, patients are required to take regimens of oral supplementation indefinitely. The dosage which confers optimum health benefit while avoiding potential toxicity and tolerability issues remains unknown. Novel preparations with improved disposition could help limit the extent of post-RYGB nutritional deficiencies.",Mangan A; Le Roux CW; Miller NG; Docherty NG,Current drug metabolism,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30362417/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30347877,Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and Their Potential Therapeutic Role in Cardiovascular System Disorders-A Review.,"Cardiovascular diseases are described as the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in modern societies. Therefore, the importance of cardiovascular diseases prevention is widely reflected in the increasing number of reports on the topic among the key scientific research efforts of the recent period. The importance of essential fatty acids (EFAs) has been recognized in the fields of cardiac science and cardiac medicine, with the significant effects of various fatty acids having been confirmed by experimental studies. Polyunsaturated fatty acids are considered to be important versatile mediators for improving and maintaining human health over the entire lifespan, however, only the cardiac effect has been extensively documented. Recently, it has been shown that omega-3 fatty acids may play a beneficial role in several human pathologies, such as obesity and diabetes mellitus type 2, and are also associated with a reduced incidence of stroke and atherosclerosis, and decreased incidence of cardiovascular diseases. A reasonable diet and wise supplementation of omega-3 EFAs are essential in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases prevention and treatment.",Sokoła-Wysoczańska E; Wysoczański T; Wagner J; Czyż K; Bodkowski R; Lochyński S; Patkowska-Sokoła B,Nutrients,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30347877/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30332944,Genetic Polymorphisms and Zinc Status: Implications for Supplementation in Metabolic Diseases.,"Zinc is an essential component for all living organisms, representing the second most abundant trace element, after iron. This element is widely distributed in the tissues of a human body where it is involved in normal growth, reproduction and several biological functions including immunity, energy metabolism and antioxidant processes. Because of its essential role, zinc levels in the human body must remain constant, independently of dietary intake fluctuations. The homeostasis of zinc is a well-regulated cellular process and has been reported to be chiefly mediated by the expression and activity of zinc-binding proteins such as metallothioneins and zinc transporters. Genes encoding for these proteins are subjected to genetic variants. We performed a multi-database electronic search to provide an overview on the relationship between specific polymorphisms (SNP) of genes encoding for metallothioneins and zinc transporters and their relationship with zinc status, immune function and some non-communicable diseases. A number of SNP are implicated in a range of metabolic disease. Some SNP may affect the impact of zinc supplementation on immune function, diabetes, and obesity. New studies are needed to clarify the interaction between individual genetic profile and zinc status. Moreover, there is a need for a better interaction between the scientific bodies and health professionals to allow better dietary and behavioural recommendations to promote human health, with particular concern to elderly people.",Virgili F; Ambra R; McCormack J; Simpson EEA; Ciarapica D; Barnaba L; Azzini E; Polito A,Current pharmaceutical design,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30332944/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30326975,The controversial role of vitamin D as an antioxidant: results from randomised controlled trials.,"Increased oxidative stress has been implicated as a potential causal factor in the development of several diseases. In the last decade, an extensive literature has been produced on vitamin D, not limited to its well-known function like a steroid hormone on skeletal tissue, but for its potential pleiotropic role in human health. Several researchers have suggested relationships between vitamin D intake and health outcomes such as cancer prevention and increased immunity, or possible role in preventing diabetes, and in inflammation. Little is known about its antioxidant effect. The aim of the present review was to explore major evidence regarding the potential scavenger capacity of vitamin D in high-evidence human studies. Studies considered by the present review suggest that the potential role of vitamin D as an antioxidant could not be confirmed. Current literature showed controversial effects about the ability of cholecalciferol to prevent or ameliorate oxidative stress biomarkers, and there is need of further and high-quality studies testing the antioxidant effect of vitamin D supplementation.",Tagliaferri S; Porri D; De Giuseppe R; Manuelli M; Alessio F; Cena H,Nutrition research reviews,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30326975/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30319623,"Inflammation, a Double-Edge Sword for Cancer and Other Age-Related Diseases.","Increasing evidence from diverse sources during the past several years has indicated that long-term, low level, chronic inflammation mediates several chronic diseases including cancer, arthritis, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological diseases. The inflammatory molecules and transcription factors, adhesion molecules, AP-1, chemokines, C-reactive protein (CRP), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, interleukins (ILs), 5-lipooxygenase (5-LOX), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), nuclear factor (NF)-kB, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are molecular links between inflammation and chronic diseases. Thus, suppression of inflammatory molecules could be potential strategy for the prevention and therapy of chronic diseases. The currently available drugs against chronic diseases are highly expensive, minimally effective and produce several side effects when taken for long period of time. The focus of this review is to discuss the potential of nutraceuticals derived from ""Mother Nature"" such as apigenin, catechins, curcumin, ellagic acid, emodin, epigallocatechin gallate, escin, fisetin, flavopiridol, genistein, isoliquiritigenin, kaempferol, mangostin, morin, myricetin, naringenin, resveratrol, silymarin, vitexin, and xanthohumol in suppression of these inflammatory pathways. Thus, these nutraceuticals offer potential in preventing or delaying the onset of chronic diseases.

30293909,"Effects of vitamin D supplementation on musculoskeletal health: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and trial sequential analysis.","The effects of vitamin D on fractures, falls, and bone mineral density are uncertain, particularly for high vitamin D doses. We aimed to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on fractures, falls, and bone density. In this systematic review, random-effects meta-analysis, and trial sequential analysis, we used findings from literature searches in previously published meta-analyses. We updated these findings by searching PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central on Sept 14, 2017, and Feb 26, 2018, using the search term ""vitamin D"" and additional keywords, without any language restrictions. We assessed randomised controlled trials of adults (>18 years) that compared vitamin D with untreated controls, placebo, or lower-dose vitamin D supplements. Trials with multiple interventions (eg, co-administered calcium and vitamin D) were eligible if the study groups differed only by use of vitamin D. We excluded trials of hydroxylated vitamin D analogues. Eligible studies included outcome data for total or hip fractures, falls, or bone mineral density measured at the lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, total body, or forearm. We extracted data about participant characteristics, study design, interventions, outcomes, funding sources, and conflicts of interest. The co-primary endpoints were participants with at least one fracture, at least one hip fracture, or at least one fall; we compared data for fractures and falls using relative risks with an intention-to-treat analysis using all available data. The secondary endpoints were the percentage change in bone mineral density from baseline at lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, total body, and forearm. We identified 81 randomised controlled trials (n=53 537 participants) that reported fracture (n=42), falls (n=37), or bone mineral density (n=41). In pooled analyses, vitamin D had no effect on total fracture (36 trials; n=44 790, relative risk 1·00, 95% CI 0·93-1·07), hip fracture (20 trials; n=36 655, 1·11, 0·97-1·26), or falls (37 trials; n=34 144, 0·97, 0·93-1·02). Results were similar in randomised controlled trials of high-dose versus low-dose vitamin D and in subgroup analyses of randomised controlled trials using doses greater than 800 IU per day. In pooled analyses, there were no clinically relevant between-group differences in bone mineral density at any site (range -0·16% to 0·76% over 1-5 years). For total fracture and falls, the effect estimate lay within the futility boundary for relative risks of 15%, 10%, 7·5%, and 5% (total fracture only), suggesting that vitamin D supplementation does not reduce fractures or falls by these amounts. For hip fracture, at a 15% relative risk, the effect estimate lay between the futility boundary and the inferior boundary, meaning there is reliable evidence that vitamin D supplementation does not reduce hip fractures by this amount, but uncertainty remains as to whether it might increase hip fractures. The effect estimate lay within the futility boundary at thresholds of 0·5% for total hip, forearm, and total body bone mineral density, and 1·0% for lumbar spine and femoral neck, providing reliable evidence that vitamin D does not alter these outcomes by these amounts. Our findings suggest that vitamin D supplementation does not prevent fractures or falls, or have clinically meaningful effects on bone mineral density. There were no differences between the effects of higher and lower doses of vitamin D. There is little justification to use vitamin D supplements to maintain or improve musculoskeletal health.

34860982,Medications and Micronutrients: Identifying Clinically Relevant Interactions and Addressing Nutritional Needs.,"<b>Objective:</b> Prescription drug use is on the rise, and the use of dietary supplementation remains common. In the United States, more than half of all adults take a dietary supplement in any given month. As a result, drug-nutrient interactions are becoming an important consideration when pharmacists counsel patients about their drug regimens. We reviewed the literature to identify common and/or clinically relevant drug-nutrient interactions that pharmacists may encounter in practice. <b>Data Sources:</b> A MEDLINE search for English-language publications from 1970 through March 2017 was performed using search terms (and variations) related to drugs, medications, micronutrients, and interactions. <b>Study Selection and Data Extraction:</b> Relevant studies, case reports, and reviews describing drug-nutrient interactions were selected for inclusion. <b>Data Synthesis:</b> Some drug-nutrient interactions may result in micronutrient insufficiencies or even frank deficiencies, thereby necessitating augmentation with multivitamin/minerals or individual vitamin/mineral dietary supplements. This most often occurs with long-term therapy for chronic conditions, such as treatment with proton-pump inhibitors and histamine-2 receptor antagonists. In addition, some chronic diseases themselves, such as diabetes, may predispose patients to micronutrient insufficiencies, and dietary supplementation may be advisable. <b>Conclusions:</b> Drug-nutrient interactions can often be resolved through specific dosing strategies to ensure that the full effect of the medication or the dietary supplement is not compromised by the other. In rare cases, the dietary supplement may need to be discontinued or monitored during treatment. Pharmacists are in a key position to identify and discuss these drug-nutrient interactions with patients and the health care team.",Prescott JD; Drake VJ; Stevens JF,The Journal of pharmacy technology : jPT : official publication of the Association of Pharmacy Technicians,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34860982/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Therefore, numerous nanoformulations have been developed for the oral bioavailability of different drugs. This review introduces applications of nanomedicine to enhance the biological activities of thymoquinone (TQ) to control different diseases in several in vivo studies as a preliminary investigation for human disease treatment with nano-TQ. Nano-TQ effectively augments the anticancer roles of doxorubicin by upregulation of P53 and downregulation of Bcl2 and potentiates paclitaxel's apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Moreover, nano-TQ protects against diabetes, inflammation, CNS, and hepatotoxicity, mainly by enhancement of organs' antioxidant status. We summarize the pros and cons of several FDA approved nanoparticle-based therapeutics and discuss the roadblocks in clinical translation, along with potential nano-TQ strategies to overcome these roadblocks. From this review, we can conclude that nano-TQ may be considered as a promising nutraceutical for human health.",El-Far AH; Al Jaouni SK; Li W; Mousa SA,Nutrients,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30257423/,1,0,0,0,0,0

30213690,"The Mediterranean diet, fish oil supplements and Rheumatoid arthritis outcomes: evidence from clinical trials.","The impact of dietary interventions such as specific types of diet or nutritional supplements in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been subject to increased attention in recent years. The recognition of the unmet need to better understand the effects of specific dietary interventions on disease outcomes in RA, along with the growing patient interest on lifestyle interventions beyond pharmacotherapy, have informed the undertaking of this narrative literature review. The benefits of the Mediterranean Diet (MD) have been shown in various studies, although only a limited number of trials focus specifically on RA. Based on the studies reviewed, the MD may provide benefits in reducing pain and swollen and tender joints in RA patients. There is more and better evidence that n-3 polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) supplementation has the potential to reduce inflammation and provide clinical benefit, possibly slowing progression to pharmacotherapy. Yet, many of these studies to date are limited in their methodology; this being partly a reflection of the complexity of the research questions being addressed. Consequently, the conclusions that can be robustly drawn from their results are restricted. With a focus on clinical trials on the MD and fish oil supplementation, this review critically appraises the evidence, discussing the findings of studies in the wider context of impact on RA outcomes, methodological challenges, and practical points to consider as part of the routine care of RA patients.",Petersson S; Philippou E; Rodomar C; Nikiphorou E,Autoimmunity reviews,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30213690/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30200502,Soybean Bioactive Peptides and Their Functional Properties.,"Soy consumption has been associated with many potential health benefits in reducing chronic diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, insulin-resistance/type II diabetes, certain type of cancers, and immune disorders. These physiological functions have been attributed to soy proteins either as intact soy protein or more commonly as functional or bioactive peptides derived from soybean processing. These findings have led to the approval of a health claim in the USA regarding the ability of soy proteins in reducing the risk for coronary heart disease and the acceptance of a health claim in Canada that soy protein can help lower cholesterol levels. Using different approaches, many soy bioactive peptides that have a variety of physiological functions such as hypolipidemic, anti-hypertensive, and anti-cancer properties, and anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory effects have been identified. Some soy peptides like lunasin and soymorphins possess more than one of these properties and play a role in the prevention of multiple chronic diseases. Overall, progress has been made in understanding the functional and bioactive components of soy. However, more studies are required to further identify their target organs, and elucidate their biological mechanisms of action in order to be potentially used as functional foods or even therapeutics for the prevention or treatment of chronic diseases.",Chatterjee C; Gleddie S; Xiao CW,Nutrients,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30200502/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The purpose of this review was to evaluate the impact of vitamin D supplementation on maternal and neonatal health measures in GDM. A comprehensive systematic literature search in the electronic databases including Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, Web of Sciences, EMBASE, Google Scholar, Clininaltrial.gov, and ProQuest as well as SID, Magiran, Irandoc, and Iranmedex for Persian literature review carried out up to January 2018. All RCTs and quasi-experimental studies that compared vitamin D supplementation with placebo or without supplementation on GDM women were included in this review. Five randomized controlled trials involving 310 women were included in the meta-analysis. There were significant differences in fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG; mean difference [MD] -12.54, 95% CI -15.03 to -10.05; 3 trials, 223 participants); total cholesterol (TC; MD -24.77, 95% CI -32.57 to -16.98; 3 trials, 223 participants); low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (MD -18.92, 95% CI -24.97 to -12.88; 3 trials, 223 participants); high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (MD, 3.87, 95% CI 1.20-6.55; 3 trials, 223 participants); high sensitivity C-reactive protein -(hs-CRP; MD -1.35, 95% CI -2.41 to -0.28; 2 trials, 126 participants); and Newborns' hyperbilirubinemia (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13-0.80; 2 trials, 129 participants).

30144878,To what extent does cinnamon administration improve the glycemic and lipid profiles?,"Cinnamon is a condiment used in cooking and by some in large quantities as a supplement with purported hypoglycemic and lipid-lowering potential. The current literature review aims to discuss the evidence of cinnamon administration regarding its hypoglycemic and lipid-lowering effects, summarizing clinical recommendations. Electronic databases including PubMed, Cochrane library, Science Direct and Web of Science were searched with the scientific name of the plant as well as the common name. The search for articles was based on following keywords: ""cinnamon diabetes"", ""cinnamon diabetes type 2"", ""cinnamon and diabetes type 2"", ""Cinnamomum aromaticum"", ""Cinnamomum cassia"", ""Cinnamomum verum"", ""Cinnamomum zeylanicum"". We carried out inclusion criteria between 2003 and 2018 focusing on human studies. Concerning glycemic profile, in individuals with type II diabetes mellitus the fasting blood glucose reduced from 12.9 to 52.2 mg/dL and HbA1c from 0.27 to 0.83%, whereas serum insulin decreased in few studies. Research papers ranged from 6 to 17 weeks in duration. The lipid lowering potential, in turn, is most controversial compared to anti-hyperglycemic potential. Also cinnamon administration has been claimed to reduce fat mass and raise serum antioxidants, but the studies used inaccurate methods. Two species are most investigated, C. cassia/aromaticum, and C.zeylanicum/verum. About 1-6 g of these cinnamon species mainly in powder seems to be an adjunct drug treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus and other conditions of glycemic impairment.

The aim of this review was to explore the evidence of thiamine deficiency among subjects with CVDs or risk factors, illustrate the theories explaining the thiamine-CVDs associations, and describe the effect of thiamine supplementation. Human and animal studies were collected from various scientific databases following the PRISMA guidelines without limitation regarding the publication year. Studies investigating the prevalence of thiamine deficiency among patients with CVDs and the effect of thiamine supplementation on their conditions were summarized.

30136344,Prospects for primary prevention of type 1 diabetes by restoring a disappearing microbe.,"Prevention of childhood-onset type 1 diabetes has become more urgent with its marked increased incidence in recent decades in the modern world. Temporally associated with the rising incidence of type 1 diabetes, as well as other autoimmune and allergic diseases in childhood in modern times, is the disappearance of Bifidobacterium and specifically Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis (B. infantis) predominance in the intestinal microbiota of breastfed, vaginally-delivered infants. B. infantis efficiently metabolizes human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) without cross-feeding free sugar monomers to other commensals or pathogens and thereby dominates the intestinal microbiota of breastfed infants. Increased levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), which stimulate both immunoregulation and healthy intestinal and pancreatic β-cell function, are generated by B. infantis. Based on recent observations of the intestinal microbiota in early life in young children who develop type 1 diabetes and demonstration of the robust preventive effects of SCFA in animal models of autoimmune diabetes, we hypothesize that restoring a B. infantis-dominant microbiota early in infancy will prevent islet autoimmunity and childhood-onset type 1 diabetes.",Insel R; Knip M,Pediatric diabetes,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30136344/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30131372,MANAGEMENT OF ENDOCRINE DISEASE: Therapeutics of Vitamin D.,"The central role of vitamin D in bone health is well recognized. However, controversies regarding its clinical application remain. We therefore aimed to review the definition of hypovitaminosis D, the skeletal and extra-skeletal effects of vitamin D and the available therapeutic modalities. Narrative and systematic literature review. An international working group that reviewed the current evidence linking bone and extra-skeletal health and vitamin D therapy to identify knowledge gaps for future research. Findings from observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in vitamin D deficiency are discordant, with findings of RCTs being largely negative. This may be due to reverse causality with the illness itself contributing to low vitamin D levels. The results of many RCTs have also been inconsistent. However, overall evidence from RCTs shows vitamin D reduces fractures (when administered with calcium) in the institutionalized elderly. Although controversial, vitamin D reduces acute respiratory tract infections (if not given as bolus monthly or annual doses) and may reduce falls in those with the lowest serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels. However, despite large ongoing RCTs with 21 000–26 000 participants not recruiting based on baseline 25OHD levels, they will contain a large subset of participants with vitamin D deficiency and are adequately powered to meet their primary end-points. The effects of long-term vitamin D supplementation on non-skeletal outcomes, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the optimal dose and serum 25OHD level that balances extra-skeletal benefits (T2DM) vs risks (e.g. CVD), may soon be determined by data from large RCTs.",Ebeling PR; Adler RA; Jones G; Liberman UA; Mazziotti G; Minisola S; Munns CF; Napoli N; Pittas AG; Giustina A; Bilezikian JP; Rizzoli R,European journal of endocrinology,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30131372/,0,1,0,0,0,0
30126163,Vitamin D Deficiency in Chronic Kidney Disease: Recent Evidence and Controversies.,"Vitamin D (VD) is a pro-hormone essential for life in higher animals. It is present in few types of foods and is produced endogenously in the skin by a photochemical reaction. The final step of VD activation occurs in the kidneys involving a second hydroxylation reaction to generate the biologically active metabolite 1,25(OH)₂-VD. Extrarenal 1α-hydroxylation has also been described to have an important role in autocrine and paracrine signaling. Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) has been in the spotlight as a major public healthcare issue with an estimated prevalence of more than a billion people worldwide. Among individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), VDD prevalence has been reported to be as high as 80%. Classically, VD plays a pivotal role in calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. Nevertheless, there is a growing body of evidence supporting the importance of VD in many vital non-skeletal biological processes such as endothelial function, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system modulation, redox balance and innate and adaptive immunity. In individuals with CKD, VDD has been associated with albuminuria, faster progression of kidney disease and increased all-cause mortality. Recent guidelines support VD supplementation in CKD based on extrapolation from cohorts conducted in the general population. In this review, we discuss new insights on the multifactorial pathophysiology of VDD in CKD as well as how it may negatively modulate different organs and systems. We also critically review the latest evidence and controversies of VD monitoring and supplementation in CKD patients.",Franca Gois PH; Wolley M; Ranganathan D; Seguro AC,International journal of environmental research and public health,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30126163/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30110239,"Exercise-induced muscle damage: What is it, what causes it and what are the nutritional solutions?","Exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) is characterized by symptoms that present both immediately and for up to 14 days after the initial exercise bout. The main consequence of EIMD for the athlete is the loss of skeletal muscle function and soreness. As such, numerous nutrients and functional foods have been examined for their potential to ameliorate the effects of EIMD and accelerate recovery, which is the purpose of many nutritional strategies for the athlete. However, the trade-off between recovery and adaptation is rarely considered. For example, many nutritional interventions described in this review target oxidative stress and inflammation, both thought to contribute to EIMD but are also crucial for the recovery and adaptation process. This calls into question whether long term administration of supplements and functional foods used to target EIMD is indeed best practice. This rapidly growing area of sports nutrition will benefit from careful consideration of the potential hormetic effect of long term use of nutritional aids that ameliorate muscle damage. This review provides a concise overview of what EIMD is, its causes and consequences and critically evaluates potential nutritional strategies to ameliorate EIMD. We present a pragmatic practical summary that can be adopted by practitioners and direct future research, with the purpose of pushing the field to better consider the fine balance between recovery and adaptation and the potential that nutritional interventions have in modulating this balance.",Owens DJ; Twist C; Cobley JN; Howatson G; Close GL,European journal of sport science,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30110239/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30049351,Phytoestrogen supplementation and body composition in postmenopausal women: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Phytoestrogen-based medications are commonly used by menopausal women, and especially by obese postmenopausal women, to relieve menopausal symptoms. Substitution of animal with soy protein is often used in weight loss regimens, yet the effect of phytoestrogens, the main constituent of soy foods, on body composition is not completely understood. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the associations between phytoestrogen supplementation and body weight and the main parameters of body composition in postmenopausal women. A literature search was done using 5 electronic databases from inception to April 2018. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with postmenopausal women comparing phytoestrogen supplementation followed by usual diet and placebo were included in the present meta-analysis. From 5932 references, we identified 23 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria, with a total of 1880 postmenopausal women. No association was observed between phytoestrogen supplementation and body weight, body mass index, waist and hip circumference, total fat mass or percentage of body fat. However, the use of phytoestrogens supplementation was associated with a slight decrease in waist-hip ratio; the pooled mean difference was -0.01 cm (95%CI: -0.01 to -0.006). In subgroup analysis, we found a modest decrease in body weight with phytoestrogens supplementation compared with placebo in healthy postmenopausal women [pooled mean difference of changes -0.28 kg (95%CI: -0.52 to -0.04)] and in RCTs with a median number of participants of 66 or less [pooled mean difference of changes -0.49 kg (95%CI: -0.87 to -0.11)]. In contrast, phytoestrogen supplementation was associated with increased body weight in postmenopausal women with preexisting metabolic disorders (prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, prehypertension and hyperlipidemia) [pooled mean difference of changes: 0.78 kg (95%CI: 0.53-1.03)]. In addition, there were some indications that some types of phytoestrogens, such as daidzein, but not soy products or isoflavone mix, could lead to modest adverse changes in body composition in menopausal women. Therefore, future studies should investigate the potential adverse effects of phytoestrogen supplementation on body composition among postmenopausal women.",Glisic M; Kastrati N; Musa J; Milic J; Asllanaj E; Portilla Fernandez E; Nano J; Ochoa Rosales C; Amiri M; Kraja B; Bano A; Bramer WM; Roks AJM; Danser AHJ; Franco OH; Muka T,Maturitas,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30049351/,0,1,0,1,0,0

Dietary polyphenols present in a wide variety of plant-based foods, herbs, and botanicals have been shown to exert antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and reduced osteoclast and alveolar bone loss activities in animal models of periodontitis. Polyphenol-containing beverages and foods especially green tea and its active catechin epigallocatechin-3-gallate, cranberries, pomegranates, and fruit and vegetable extracts have reported bacteriostatic/bactericidal activity against microbial species such as <i>P. gingivalis</i> and shown total bacterial burden in clinical studies. These polyphenols also exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which have the potential to impact various biological mechanisms for reducing the initiation and progression of periodontitis.

30029482,l-Citrulline Supplementation: Impact on Cardiometabolic Health.,"Diminished bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO), the gaseous signaling molecule involved in the regulation of numerous vital biological functions, contributes to the development and progression of multiple age- and lifestyle-related diseases. While l-arginine is the precursor for the synthesis of NO by endothelial-nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), oral l-arginine supplementation is largely ineffective at increasing NO synthesis and/or bioavailability for a variety of reasons. l-citrulline, found in high concentrations in watermelon, is a neutral alpha-amino acid formed by enzymes in the mitochondria that also serves as a substrate for recycling l-arginine. Unlike l-arginine, l-citrulline is not quantitatively extracted from the gastrointestinal tract (i.e., enterocytes) or liver and its supplementation is therefore more effective at increasing l-arginine levels and NO synthesis. Supplementation with l-citrulline has shown promise as a blood pressure lowering intervention (both resting and stress-induced) in adults with pre-/hypertension, with pre-clinical (animal) evidence for atherogenic-endothelial protection. Preliminary evidence is also available for l-citrulline-induced benefits to muscle and metabolic health (via vascular and non-vascular pathways) in susceptible/older populations. In this review, we examine the impact of supplementing this important urea cycle intermediate on cardiovascular and metabolic health outcomes and identify future directions for investigating its therapeutic impact on cardiometabolic health.",Allerton TD; Proctor DN; Stephens JM; Dugas TR; Spielmann G; Irving BA,Nutrients,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30029482/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30021626,Dietary intakes of flavan-3-ols and cardiovascular health: a field synopsis using evidence mapping of randomized trials and prospective cohort studies.,"There is considerable interest in the impact of increased flavan-3-ol intake on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes outcomes. Through evidence mapping, we determined the extent of the evidence base to initiate a future systematic review investigating the impact of flavan-3-ol intake on CVD and diabetes outcomes. We developed a research protocol, convened a technical expert panel (TEP) to refine the specific research questions, conducted a systematic search in multiple databases, double-screened abstracts and full-text articles, performed data extractions, and synthesized the data. We focused on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies which assessed intakes of flavan-3-ol from foods, beverages, and supplement/extract sources on biomarkers and clinical outcomes of CVD and diabetes. Of 257 eligible articles, 223 and 34 publications contributed to 226 RCTs and 39 prospective cohort studies, respectively. In RCTs, the most frequently studied interventions were cocoa-based products (23.2%); berries (16.1%); tea in the form of green tea (13.9%), black tea (7.2%), or unspecified tea (3.6%); and red wine (11.2%). Mean total flavan-3-ol intake was highest in the cocoa-based trials (618.7 mg/day) and lowest in the interventions feeding red wine (123.7 mg/day). The most frequently reported outcomes were intermediate biomarkers including serum lipid levels (63.4%), blood glucose (50.9%), blood pressure (50.8%), flow-mediated dilation (21.9%), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (21.9%). The included 34 prospective cohort studies predominantly examined exposures to flavan-3-ols (26%), cocoa-based products (23.2%), berries (16.1%), and green tea (13.9%) and CVD incidence and mortality. Through a systematic, evidence-based approach, evidence mapping on flavan-3-ol intake and CVD outcomes demonstrated sufficient data relating to flavan-3ol intake and biomarkers and clinical outcomes of CVD and diabetes. The current evidence base highlights the distribution of available data which both support the development of a future systematic review and identified the research need for future long-term RCTs.

30002281,Olive Oil Nutraceuticals in the Prevention and Management of Diabetes: From Molecules to Lifestyle.,"Lifestyle is the primary prevention of diabetes, especially type-2 diabetes (T2D). Nutritional intake of olive oil (OO), the key Mediterranean diet component has been associated with the prevention and management of many chronic diseases including T2D. Several OO bioactive compounds such as monounsaturated fatty acids, and key biophenols including hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein, have been associated with preventing inflammation and cytokine-induced oxidative damage, glucose lowering, reducing carbohydrate absorption, and increasing insulin sensitivity and related gene expression. However, research into the interaction of OO nutraceuticals with lifestyle components, especially physical activity, is lacking. Promising postprandial effects have been reported when OO or other similar monounsaturated fatty acids were the main dietary fat compared with other diets. Animal studies have shown a potential anabolic effect of oleuropein. Such effects could be further potentiated via exercise, especially strength training, which is an essential exercise prescription for individuals with T2D. There is also an evidence from in vitro, animal, and limited human studies for a dual preventative role of OO biophenols in diabetes and cancer, especially that they share similar risk factors. Putative antioxidative and anti-inflammatory mechanisms and associated gene expressions resulting from OO biophenols have produced paradoxical results, making suggested inferences from dual prevention T2D and cancer outcomes difficult. Well-designed human interventions and clinical trials are needed to decipher such a potential dual anticancer and antidiabetic effects of OO nutraceuticals. Exercise combined with OO consumption, individually or as part of a healthy diet is likely to induce reciprocal action for T2D prevention outcomes.",Alkhatib A; Tsang C; Tuomilehto J,International journal of molecular sciences,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30002281/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29981570,Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids favourably modulate cardiometabolic biomarkers in type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis and meta-regression of randomized controlled trials.,"Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggest that supplementation with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3PUFAs) may favourably modify cardiometabolic biomarkers in type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Previous meta-analyses are limited by insufficient sample sizes and omission of meta-regression techniques, and a large number of RCTs have subsequently been published since the last comprehensive meta-analysis. Updated information regarding the impact of dosage, duration or an interaction between these two factors is therefore warranted. The objective was to comprehensively assess the effect of n-3PUFAs supplementation on cardiometabolic biomarkers including lipid profiles, inflammatory parameters, blood pressure, and indices of glycaemic control, in people with T2DM, and identify whether treatment dosage, duration or an interaction thereof modify these effects. Databases including PubMed and MEDLINE were searched until 13th July 2017 for RCTs investigating the effect of n-3PUFAs supplementation on lipid profiles, inflammatory parameters, blood pressure, and indices of glycaemic control. Data were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis and presented as standardised mean difference (Hedges g) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Meta-regression analysis was performed to investigate the effects of duration of supplementation and total dosage of n-3PUFAs as moderator variables where appropriate. A total of 45 RCTs were identified, involving 2674 people with T2DM. n-3PUFAs supplementation was associated with significant reductions in LDL [ES: - 0.10, (95% CI - 0.17, - 0.03); p = 0.007], VLDL (ES: - 0.26 (- 0.51, - 0.01); p = 0.044], triglycerides (ES: - 0.39 (- 0.55, - 0.24; p ≤ 0.001] and HbA1c (ES: - 0.27 (- 0.48, - 0.06); p = 0.010]. Moreover, n-3PUFAs supplementation was associated with reduction in plasma levels of TNF-α [ES: - 0.59 (- 1.17, - 0.01); p = 0.045] and IL-6 (ES: - 1.67 (- 3.14, - 0.20); p = 0.026]. All other lipid markers, indices of glycaemic control, inflammatory parameters, and blood pressure remained unchanged (p > 0.05). n-3PUFAs supplementation produces favourable hypolipidemic effects, a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and improvement in glycaemia. Neither duration nor dosage appear to explain the observed heterogeneity in response to n-3PUFAs.

29974401,Selenium exposure and the risk of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"In 2007, supplementation with the trace element selenium in a trial was unexpectedly found to be associated with an excess risk of type 2 diabetes. Given the concerns raised by these findings and the large number of recent studies on this topic, we reviewed the available literature with respect to this possible association. In this paper, we assessed the results of both experimental and nonexperimental epidemiologic studies linking selenium with type 2 diabetes incidence. Through a systematic literature search, we retrieved 50 potentially eligible nonexperimental studies and 5 randomized controlled trials published through June 11, 2018. To elucidate the possible dose-response relation, we selected for further analysis those studies that included multiple exposure levels and serum or plasma levels. We computed a pooled summary risk ratio (RR) of diabetes according to selenium exposure in these studies. We also computed a RR for diabetes incidence following supplementation with 200 µg/day of selenium compared with placebo in trials. In the nonexperimental studies, we found a direct relation between selenium exposure and risk of diabetes, with a clear and roughly linear trend in subjects with higher plasma or serum selenium levels, with RR at 140 µg/L of selenium exposure compared with a referent category of < 45 µg/L equal to 3.6 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-9.4]. A dose-response meta-analysis focusing on studies with direct assessment of dietary selenium intake showed a similar trend. In experimental studies, selenium supplementation increased the risk of diabetes by 11% (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01-1.22) compared with the placebo-allocated participants, with a higher RR in women than in men. Overall, results from both nonexperimental and experimental studies indicate that selenium may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes across a wide range of exposure levels. The relative increase in risk is small but of possible public health importance because of the high incidence of diabetes and the ubiquity of selenium exposure.",Vinceti M; Filippini T; Rothman KJ,European journal of epidemiology,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29974401/,0,1,0,1,0,0
29960068,Emerging role of nutrition and the non-coding landscape in type 2 diabetes mellitus: A review of literature.,"With the advent of recent advances in molecular techniques and whole genome sequencing, we have come to know that the non-coding landscape (including non-coding RNAs, tRNAs and even telomeres) plays a major role in the regulation of cellular processes. Furthermore, the deregulation of this landscape has been found to contribute to and even bring about the pathogenesis of a large number of diseases. One of such diseases is diabetes mellitus (type 2 specifically) whose incidence rate and global burden is constantly increasing. Nutrition has been proven to be a key player in the development, onset and control of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Additionally, non-coding DNA based molecular markers are emerging as biomarkers of T2D, susceptibility, and perhaps dietary supplements can modulate non-coding DNA based markers expression and function in T2D management. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the developmental origins and genetics of type 2 diabetes mellitus, how each component of the non-coding landscape contributes to the development and progression of the disease and finally we discuss how dietary interventions modulate the non-coding landscape in T2D.",Matboli M; Shafei A; Ali M; Kamal KM; Noah M; Lewis P; Habashy A; Ehab M; Gaber AI; Abdelzaher H,Gene,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29960068/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29945132,Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation on Some Inflammatory Biomarkers in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Subjects: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"The mechanism, by which vitamin D influences inflammatory biomarkers in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is not very well known. Thus, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was conducted to assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation on some inflammatory biomarkers in T2DM subjects. We searched randomized controlled trials from PubMed and the Cochrane Library in October 2017 and conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation on high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Either a fixed-effects or a random-effects model was used to calculate pooled effects. We identified 13 studies that met our inclusion criteria. The results indicated that the vitamin D supplementation significant decreased the hs-CRP level by 0.45 μg/mL, whereas the vitamin D supplementation did not  influence the TNF-α and IL-6. Subgroup analysis showed that vitamin D significantly lowered hs-CRP by 0.34 μg/mL among trials with a daily vitamin D dose ≤4,000 IU and by 0.31 μg/mL among trials with time of vitamin D supplementation > 12 weeks. Vitamin D supplementation is beneficial for the reduction of hs-CRP inT2DM subjects but does not have a significant influence on TNF-α and IL-6 in T2DM subjects.",Yu Y; Tian L; Xiao Y; Huang G; Zhang M,Annals of nutrition & metabolism,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29945132/,0,1,0,1,0,0
29938622,Nutrition and Nutraceuticals in Neuroinflammatory and Brain Metabolic Stress: Implications for Neurodegenerative Disorders.,"A steep rise in the incidences of neurodegenerative disorders could be the combined effect of several non-genetic factors such as increased life expectancy, environmental pollutants, lifestyle, and dietary habits, as population-level genetic change require multiple generations. Emerging evidence suggests that chronic over-nutrition induces brain metabolic stress and neuroinflammation, and are individually known to promote neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD). Although the association of metabolic disorders such as diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and atherosclerosis with the dietary habits is well known, neuronal implications of diet and nutritional factors is still in its infancy. Transcriptomics and proteomics-based studies support the view that nutraceuticals target multiple neuroprotective pathways in a slow but effective manner without causing severe adverse effects, and may represent the future of tackling neurodegenerative disorders. In this article we i) review the diet/dietary supplement connection with brain metabolic stress and neuroinflammation and ii) summarize current knowledge of the effects of nutraceuticals on neurodegenerative disorders.",Pandareesh MD; Kandikattu HK; Razack S; Amruta N; Choudhari R; Vikram A; Doddapattar P,CNS & neurological disorders drug targets,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29938622/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29937486,"Nutrients, Nutraceuticals, and Xenobiotics Affecting Renal Health.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 8⁻16% of the population worldwide. In developed countries, the most important risk factors for CKD are diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, calling into question the importance of educating and acting on lifestyles and nutrition. A balanced diet and supplementation can indeed support the maintenance of a general health status, including preservation of renal function, and can help to manage and curb the main risk factors for renal damage. While the concept of protein and salt restriction in nephrology is historically acknowledged, the role of some nutrients in renal health and the importance of nutrition as a preventative measure for renal care are less known. In this narrative review, we provide an overview of the demonstrated and potential actions of some selected nutrients, nutraceuticals, and xenobiotics on renal health and function. The direct and indirect effects of fiber, protein, fatty acids, curcumin, steviol glycosides, green tea, coffee, nitrates, nitrites, and alcohol on kidney health are reviewed here. In view of functional and personalized nutrition, understanding the renal and systemic effects of dietary components is essential since many chronic conditions, including CKD, are related to systemic dysfunctions such as chronic low-grade inflammation.",Cosola C; Sabatino A; di Bari I; Fiaccadori E; Gesualdo L,Nutrients,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29937486/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29927872,Nutritional Considerations in Pediatric Pancreatitis: A Position Paper from the NASPGHAN Pancreas Committee and ESPGHAN Cystic Fibrosis/Pancreas Working Group.,"Wide variations exist in how physicians manage the nutritional aspects of children affected by acute pancreatitis (AP), acute recurrent pancreatitis (ARP), and chronic (CP) pancreatitis. Better consensus for optimal management is needed. This consensus statement on nutrition in pediatric pancreatic diseases was developed through a joint ESPGHAN-NASPGHAN working group that performed an evidence-based search of the literature on nutrition in AP, ARP, and CP with a focus on pediatrics. The literature was summarized, quality of evidence reviewed, and expert recommendations developed. The authorship met to discuss the evidence and statements. Voting on recommendations occurred over 2 rounds based on feedback. A consensus of at least 75% was required to approve a recommendation. Areas requiring further research were identified. The literature on nutrition in pediatric pancreatitis is limited. Children with mild AP benefit from starting an early nutritional regimen in the course of the attack. Early nutrition should be attempted in severe AP when possible; enteral nutrition is preferred over parenteral nutrition. Children with ARP are likely to tolerate and benefit from a regular diet. Children with CP need ongoing assessment for growth and nutritional deficiencies, exocrine and endocrine insufficiencies. This document presents the first authoritative recommendations on nutritional considerations in pediatric pancreatitis. Future research should address the gaps in knowledge particularly relating to optimal nutrition for AP in children, role of diet or dietary supplements on recurrent attacks of pancreatitis and pain episodes, monitoring practices to detect early growth and nutritional deficiencies in CP and identifying risk factors that predispose children to these deficiencies.",Abu-El-Haija M; Uc A; Werlin SL; Freeman AJ; Georgieva M; Jojkić-Pavkov D; Kalnins D; Kochavi B; Koot BGP; Van Biervliet S; Walkowiak J; Wilschanski M; Morinville VD,Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29927872/,0,0,0,0,0,0

The data were collected using the medical subheading (MeSH) terms: (""diabetes, gestational""[MeSH Terms] OR (""diabetes""[All Fields] AND ""gestational""[All Fields]) OR ""gestational diabetes""[All Fields] OR (""gestational""[All Fields] AND ""diabetes""[All Fields])) AND (""probiotics""[MeSH Terms] OR ""probiotics""[All Fields]). The search included original articles written in English/Portuguese and published between 2012 and 2017. Of the 31 articles identified, seven met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. In these studies, the sample size ranged from 60 to 373 women with GDM, which was between 24 and 40 weeks of pregnancy (second and third trimesters). Results demonstrated that probiotics used during pregnancy in women with GDM may improve glycaemic control and reduce VDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and inflammatory markers. The present systematic review highlights the importance of probiotics for glycemic control and decrease of inflammatory markers in GDM.

The following databases were searched up to December 2017: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The quality of the relevant extracted data was assessed according to the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data were pooled using the inverse variance method and expressed as mean difference with 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI). Heterogeneity between studies was assessed by the Cochran Q statistic and I-squared tests (I<sup>2</sup>). Overall, 33 studies were included in the meta-analyses. Vitamin D supplementation were found to significantly reduce serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (WMD 0.27; 95% CI, - 0.35, - 0.20; p<0.001) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (WMD - 0.43, 95% CI - 0.62, - 0.25, p<0.001) in diabetic patients. In addition, vitamin D supplementation were found to increase markers of nitric oxide (NO) release (WMD 4.33, 95% CI 0.96, 7.70), total serum antioxidant capacity (TAC) (WMD 57.34, 95% CI 33.48, 81.20, p<0.001) and total glutathione (GSH) levels (WMD 82.59, 95% CI 44.37, 120.81, p<0.001). Overall, this meta-analysis shows that in diabetic patients, taking vitamin D had significant effects on hs-CRP and MDA levels, and significantly increased NO, TAC and GSH levels.",Mansournia MA; Ostadmohammadi V; Doosti-Irani A; Ghayour-Mobarhan M; Ferns G; Akbari H; Ghaderi A; Talari HR; Asemi Z,Hormone and metabolic research = Hormon- und Stoffwechselforschung = Hormones et metabolisme,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29883970/,0,1,0,1,0,0
29868916,Effects of vitamin D supplementation on markers for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes: an individual participant data meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for the causal role of vitamin D on noncommunicable disease outcomes is inconclusive. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there are beneficial or harmful effects of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) supplementation according to subgroups of remeasured serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] on cardiovascular and glucometabolic surrogate markers with the use of individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of RCTs. Twelve RCTs (16 wk to 1 y of follow-up) were included. For standardization, 25(OH)D concentrations for all participants (n = 2994) at baseline and postintervention were re-measured in bio-banked serum samples with the use of a certified liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method traceable to a reference measurement procedure. IPD meta-analyses were performed according to subgroups of remeasured 25(OH)D. Main outcomes were blood pressure and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Secondary outcomes were LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol and triglycerides; parathyroid hormone (PTH); fasting glucose, insulin, and C-peptide; and 2-h glucose. In secondary analyses, other potential effect modifiers were studied. Remeasurement of 25(OH)D resulted in a lower mean 25(OH)D concentration in 10 of 12 RCTs. Vitamin D supplementation had no effect on the main outcomes of blood pressure and HbA1c. Supplementation resulted in 10-20% lower PTH concentrations, irrespective of the 25(OH)D subgroups. The subgroup analyses according to achieved 25(OH)D concentrations showed a significant decrease in LDL-cholesterol concentrations after vitamin D supplementation in 25(OH)D subgroups with <75, <100, and <125 nmol of -0.10 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.20, -0.00 mmol/L), -0.10 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.18, -0.02 mmol/L), and -0.07 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.14, -0.00 mmol/L), respectively. Patient features that modified the treatment effect could not be identified. For the main outcomes of blood pressure and HbA1c, the data support no benefit for vitamin D supplementation. For the secondary outcomes, in addition to its effect on PTH, we observed indications for a beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation only on LDL cholesterol, which warrants further investigation.

29799294,The protean role of haptoglobin and haptoglobin genotypes on vascular complications in diabetes mellitus.,"Introduction and background Haptoglobin (Hp) is considered to be an antioxidant and protective against cardiovascular complications. Polymorphisms in the Hp gene interact with diabetes mellitus to affect the risk of vascular complications. Methods We review the updated literature about the protean role of Hp and Hp genotypes spanning genomics, molecular, translational and clinical studies. We searched Pubmed, SCOPUS and Google Scholar for all articles using the keywords: haptoglobin and/or haptoglobin polymorphism and diabetes. We review the diverse Hp genotypes, phenotypes and the impact on diabetes complications, including lessons from animal models and in vitro models. We describe the clinical studies on the associations of Hp genotypes with vascular complications in type 1 and type 2 diabetes comprehensively. We review the studies looking at vitamin E supplementation in a personalized manner in Hp2-2 diabetes individuals. Results and conclusion Hp genotypes have evolved as a result of deletions in the traditional Hp genes. The Hp genotypes have been associated with microvascular and macrovascular complications in type 1 diabetes mellitus but the association in type 2 diabetes is more consistent with cardiovascular complications. A preferential benefit of vitamin E and other antioxidants in the Hp2-2 genotype for cardiovascular complications in type 2 diabetes has been seen presumably secondary to interaction with high-density lipoprotein function. Hence, the Hp genotype can be used to personalize antioxidant therapeutics in diabetes patients. These results need to be corroborated in large, global, pragmatic, prospective, cardiovascular outcome trials in type 2 diabetes patients.",Dalan R; Liuh Ling G,European journal of preventive cardiology,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29799294/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29793661,Dietary Magnesium and Chronic Disease.,"Although official magnesium (Mg) dietary reference intakes are open to question, a significant number of adults likely have intakes that are in the range of 50%-99% of the requirement. This moderate or marginal (subclinical) deficient Mg intake generally is asymptomatic. Animal studies, however, indicate that moderate or subclinical Mg deficiency primes phagocytic cells for the release of proinflammatory cytokines leading to chronic inflammatory and oxidative stress. Human studies have found that dietary Mg is inversely related to serum or plasma C-reactive protein (CRP). Individuals with apparently deficient Mg intakes have an increased likelihood of serum or plasma CRP ≥3.0 mg/L, considered an indicator of chronic inflammatory stress that increases the risk for chronic disease. In addition, elevated serum or plasma CRP in individuals with chronic disease is decreased by Mg supplementation, which suggests that Mg decreases the risk for chronic disease. The importance of dietary Mg intake on the risk for chronic disease through affecting inflammatory and oxidative stress is supported by numerous meta-analyses and systematic reviews that have found dietary Mg is inversely associated with chronic diseases such hypertension, ischemic heart disease, stroke, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and colorectal cancer.",Nielsen FH,Advances in chronic kidney disease,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29793661/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29766349,Recent Developments in the Role of Coenzyme Q10 for Coronary Heart Disease: a Systematic Review.,"This review examines recent randomized clinical trials evaluating the role of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) in the management of coronary heart disease. CoQ10 is one of the most commonly used dietary supplements in the USA. Due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, CoQ10 has been studied extensively for possible use in managing coronary heart disease. One of the most common applications of CoQ10 is to mitigate statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) based on the theory that SAMS are caused by statin depletion of CoQ10 in the muscle. Although previous studies of CoQ10 for SAMS have produced mixed results, CoQ10 appears to be safe. Because CoQ10 is a cofactor in the generation of adenosine triphosphate, supplementation has also recently been studied in patients with heart failure, which is inherently an energy deprived state. The Q-SYMBIO trial found that CoQ10 supplementation in patients with heart failure not only improved functional capacity, but also significantly reduced cardiovascular events and mortality. Despite these positive findings, a larger prospective trial is warranted to support routine use of CoQ10. Less impressive are the effects of CoQ10 on specific cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and glycemic control. Current evidence does not support routine use of CoQ10 in patients with coronary heart disease. Additional studies are warranted to fully determine the benefit of CoQ10 in patients with heart failure before including it in guideline-directed medical therapy.",Ayers J; Cook J; Koenig RA; Sisson EM; Dixon DL,Current atherosclerosis reports,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29766349/,0,1,0,0,0,0
29765164,Intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids and risk of preclinical and clinical type 1 diabetes in children-a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The association between the intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and the risk of preclinical and clinical type 1 diabetes (T1D) in children has generated conflicting results. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the definite effects of PUFAs on the risk of preclinical and clinical T1D. Three databases were systematically searched up to July 18, 2017 to identify relevant observational studies, without language restriction. Any study included should report the risk of preclinical or clinical T1D in children with PUFAs supplementation compared with the controls, and report relative risks (RRs) or odds ratios (ORs) or provide data for estimation. Pooled RRs (or ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using random-effects models irrespective of statistical heterogeneity assessed by I<sup>2</sup> statistic. We identified seven studies (three prospective cohort studies and four case-control studies) on PUFAs intake during pregnancy or during early life in children. The pooled RR between the risk of preclinical T1D and n-3 PUFAs supplementation against controls was 0.98 (95%CI, 0.85-1.13), with no heterogeneity. The results were similar after the intake during pregnancy, but not during early life in children (pooled RR, 0.45; 95%CI, 0.21-0.96; P = 0.039). N-3 PUFAs supplementation was not associated with a significant reduction in the risk of clinical T1D in children (pooled RR, 0.87; 95%CI, 0.71-1.08), with substantial heterogeneity(I<sup>2</sup> = 64.7%). No association was also found between n-6 PUFAs intake and the risk of preclinical (1.07; 0.97-1.017) or clinical T1D (1.05; 0.92-1.20) in children. The result of the meta-analysis does not support that n-3 or n-6 PUFAs supplementation in children affects the overall risk of preclinical or clinical T1D. However, n-3 PUFAs intake in early life might reduce the risk of preclinical T1D. Therefore, this finding should be verified by more and well-designed prospective research in the future.",Liu X; Zhang Y; Wu H; Zhu P; Mo X; Ma X; Ying J,European journal of clinical nutrition,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29765164/,0,1,0,1,0,1
29762515,Iron Status and Gestational Diabetes-A Meta-Analysis.,"A meta-analysis of the association of iron overload with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) may inform the health debate. We performed a meta-analysis investigating the association of iron biomarkers and dietary iron exposure with GDM. We identified 33 eligible studies (<i>N</i> = 44,110) published in 2001⁻2017. The standardized mean differences (SMD) in women who had GDM compared to pregnant women without were 0.25 µg/dL (95% CI: 0.001⁻0.50) for iron, 1.54 ng/mL (0.56⁻2.53) for ferritin, 1.05% (0.02 to 2.08) for transferrin saturation, and 0.81 g/dL (0.40⁻1.22) for hemoglobin. Adjusted odds ratio for GDM were 1.58 (95% CI: 1.20⁻2.08) for ferritin, 1.30 (1.01⁻1.67) for hemoglobin, and 1.48 (1.29⁻1.69) for dietary heme intake. We did not find any differences in TIBC or transferrin concentration in women with and without GDM. We also did not find any association of increased transferrin receptor or increased intake of total dietary iron, non-heme iron or supplemental iron, with increased odds ratios for GDM. Considerable heterogeneity was present among the studies (0⁻99%), but no evidence of publication bias. Accumulating evidence suggests that circulating and dietary iron biomarkers among pregnant women are associated with GDM, but the results should be interpreted with caution due to the high heterogeneity of analyses. Randomized trials investigating the benefits of iron reduction in women at high risk for GDM are warranted.",Kataria Y; Wu Y; Horskjær PH; Mandrup-Poulsen T; Ellervik C,Nutrients,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29762515/,1,0,0,1,0,0
29745362,Does dietary nitrate say NO to cardiovascular ageing? Current evidence and implications for research.,"CVD are characterised by a multi-factorial pathogenesis. Key pathogenetic steps in the development of CVD are the occurrence of endothelial dysfunction and formation of atherosclerotic lesions. Reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability is a primary event in the initiation of the atherosclerotic cascade. NO is a free radical with multiple physiological functions including the regulation of vascular resistance, coagulation, immunity and oxidative metabolism. The synthesis of NO proceeds via two distinct pathways identified as enzymatic and non-enzymatic. The former involves the conversion of arginine into NO by the NO synthases, whilst the latter comprises a two-step reducing process converting inorganic nitrate into nitrite and subsequently NO.Inorganic is present in water and food, particularly beetroot and green leafy vegetables. Several investigations have therefore used the non-enzymatic NO pathway as a target for nutritional supplementation ( salts) or dietary interventions (high- foods) to increase NO bioavailability and impact on cardiovascular outcomes. Some studies have reported positive effects of dietary on systolic blood pressure and endothelial function in patients with hypertension and chronic heart failure. Nevertheless, results have been inconsistent and the size of the effect appears to be declining in older individuals. Additionally, there is a paucity of studies for disorders such as diabetes, CHD and chronic kidney failure. Thus, whilst dietary supplementation could represent an effective and viable strategy for the primary and secondary prevention of age-related cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, more large-scale, robust studies are awaited to confirm or refute this notion.",Siervo M; Scialò F; Shannon OM; Stephan BCM; Ashor AW,The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29745362/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29702603,Italian Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AME) and Italian Chapter of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) Position Statement: Clinical Management of Vitamin D Deficiency in Adults.,"Vitamin D deficiency is very common and prescriptions of both assay and supplementation are increasing more and more. Health expenditure is exponentially increasing, thus it is timely and appropriate to establish rules. The Italian Association of Clinical Endocrinologists appointed a task force to review literature about vitamin D deficiency in adults. Four topics were identified as worthy for the practicing clinicians. For each topic recommendations based on scientific evidence and clinical practice were issued according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) System. (1) What cut-off defines vitamin D deficiency: even though 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) can be considered appropriate in the general population, we recommend to maintain levels above 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) in categories at risk. (2) Whom, when, and how to perform screening for vitamin D deficiency: categories at risk (patients with bone, liver, kidney diseases, obesity, malabsorption, during pregnancy and lactation, some elderly) but not healthy people should be screened by the 25-hydroxy-vitamin D assay. (3) Whom and how to treat vitamin D deficiency: beyond healthy lifestyle (mostly sun exposure), we recommend oral vitamin D (vitamin D2 or vitamin D3) supplementation in patients treated with bone active drugs and in those with demonstrated deficiency. Dosages, molecules and modalities of administration can be profitably individually tailored. (4) How to monitor the efficacy of treatment with vitamin D: no routine monitoring is suggested during vitamin D treatment due to its large therapeutic index. In particular conditions, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D can be assayed after at least a 6-month treatment. We are confident that this document will help practicing clinicians in their daily clinical practice.",Cesareo R; Attanasio R; Caputo M; Castello R; Chiodini I; Falchetti A; Guglielmi R; Papini E; Santonati A; Scillitani A; Toscano V; Triggiani V; Vescini F; Zini M,Nutrients,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29702603/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29695082,"Marine Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Complications of Pregnancy and Maternal Risk Factors for Offspring Cardio-Metabolic Disease.","Marine omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) are important nutrients during periods of rapid growth and development in utero and infancy. Maternal health and risk factors play a crucial role in birth outcomes and subsequently offspring cardio-metabolic health. Evidence from observational studies and randomized trials have suggested a potential association of maternal intake of marine n-3 PUFAs during pregnancy with pregnancy and birth outcomes. However, there is inconsistency in the literature on whether marine n-3 PUFA supplementation during pregnancy can prevent maternal complications of pregnancy. This narrative literature review summarizes recent evidence on observational and clinical trials of marine n-3 PUFA intake on maternal risk factors and effects on offspring cardio-metabolic health. The current evidence generally does not support a role of maternal n-3 PUFA supplementation in altering the incidence of gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension, or pre-eclampsia. It may be that benefits from marine n-3 PUFA supplementation are more pronounced in high-risk populations, such as women with a history of complications of pregnancy, or women with low marine n-3 PUFA intake. Discrepancies between studies may be related to differences in study design, dosage, fatty acid interplay, and length of treatment. Further prospective double-blind studies are needed to clarify the impact of long-chain marine n-3 PUFAs on risk factors for cardio-metabolic disease in the offspring.",Phang M; Skilton MR,Marine drugs,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29695082/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29684104,Maternal vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy.,"Maternal vitamin D status in pregnancy has been linked to many health outcomes in mother and offspring. A wealth of observational studies have reported on both obstetric outcomes and complications, including pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, mode and timing of delivery. Many foetal and childhood outcomes are also linked to vitamin D status, including measures of foetal size, body composition and skeletal mineralization, in addition to later childhood outcomes, such as asthma. Synthesis of systematic and narrative reviews. The findings are generally inconsistent in most areas, and, at present, there is a lack of data from high-quality intervention studies to confirm a causal role for vitamin D in these outcomes. In most areas, the evidence tends towards maternal vitamin D being of overall benefit, but often does not reach statistical significance in meta-analyses. The most conclusive evidence is in the role of maternal vitamin D supplementation in the prevention of neonatal hypocalcaemia; as a consequence the UK department of health recommends that pregnant women take 400 IU vitamin D daily. High-quality randomized placebo-controlled trials, such as the UK-based MAVIDOS trial, will inform the potential efficacy and safety of vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy across a variety of outcomes.",Curtis EM; Moon RJ; Harvey NC; Cooper C,British medical bulletin,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29684104/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29679742,Adaptive thermogenesis by dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids: Emerging evidence and mechanisms.,"Brown/beige fat plays a crucial role in maintaining energy homeostasis through non-shivering thermogenesis in response to cold temperature and excess nutrition (adaptive thermogenesis). Although numerous molecular and genetic regulators have been identified, relatively little information is available regarding thermogenic dietary molecules. Recently, a growing body of evidence suggests that high consumption of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) or activation of GPR120, a membrane receptor of n-3 PUFA, stimulate adaptive thermogenesis. In this review, we summarize the emerging evidence that n-3 PUFA promote brown/beige fat formation and highlight the potential mechanisms whereby n-3 PUFA require GPR120 as a signaling platform or act independently. Human clinical trials are revisited in the context of energy expenditure. Additionally, we explore some future perspective that n-3 PUFA intake might be a useful strategy to boost or sustain metabolic activities of brown/beige fat at different lifecycle stages of pregnancy and senescence. Given that a high ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFA intake is associated with the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes, understanding the impact of n-6/n-3 ratio on energy expenditure and adaptive thermogenesis will inform the implementation of a novel nutritional strategy for preventing obesity.",Fan R; Koehler K; Chung S,Biochimica et biophysica acta.

29672124,The effects of supplementation with conjugated linoleic acid on anthropometric indices and body composition in overweight and obese subjects: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Clinical trials have indicated conflicting results on the effects of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on obesity. The present study aimed to systematically review controlled clinical trials examining the effects of CLA on anthropometric indices and body composition in overweight and obese subjects. Pubmed, Scopus, Web of science, and Cochrane databases were searched between 2000 and December 2017 with no language restriction. Placebo-controlled clinical trials that reported anthropometric indices and body composition in overweight and obese subjects were included. Random-effect model was used to pool the effect estimates. Of 4032 publications, 13 trials were included for the meta-analysis. Pooled effect sizes indicated that CLA significantly reduced body weight (WMD: -0.52 kg, 95% CI: -0.83, -0.21; I<sup>2</sup>: 48.0%, p = 0.01), BMI (WMD: -0.23 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95% CI: -0.39, - 0.06; I<sup>2</sup>: 64.7%, p = 0.0001), FM (WMD: -0.61 kg, 95% CI: -0.98, -0.24; I<sup>2</sup>: 53.8%, p = 0.01) and increased LBM (WMD: 0.19 kg, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.34; I<sup>2</sup>: 81.4%, p = 0.0001) compared to the placebo group. However, the effects of CLA on WC (WMD: 0.05 cm, 95% CI: -0.01, 0.1; I<sup>2</sup>: 0%, p = 0.93) was not significant. Additionally, its impact on body weight in subjects older than 44 year (WMD: -1.05 kg, 95% CI: -1.75, -0.35; I<sup>2</sup>: 57.0%, p = 0.01), with longer duration (more than 12 weeks) (WMD: -1.29 kg, 95% CI: -2.29, -0.29; I<sup>2</sup>: 70.3%, p = 0.003) and dosage more than 3.4 g/day (WMD: -0.77 kg, 95% CI: -1.28, -0.25; I<sup>2</sup>: 62.7%, p = 0.004) were greater than comparative groups. Supplementation with CLA can slightly reduce body weight and FM and increase LBM in overweight and obese subjects. However, its efficacy was not clinically considerable. Further studies with high methodological quality are needed to shed light on the effects of CLA on anthropometric indices in overweight and obese subjects.",Namazi N; Irandoost P; Larijani B; Azadbakht L,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29672124/,0,1,0,1,0,0
29661756,Prevention of rickets and osteomalacia in the UK: political action overdue.,"The consequences of vitamin D and dietary calcium deficiency have become a huge public health concern in the UK. The burden of disease from these deficiencies includes rickets, and hypocalcaemic seizures, dilated cardiomyopathy and mostly occult myopathy and osteomalacia. The increasing burden of the disease is intrinsically linked to ethnicity and the population demographic changes in the UK. Three facts have led to the resurfacing of the English disease: (1) the UK has no ultraviolet sunlight for at least 6 months of the year, (2) dark skin produces far less vitamin D than white skin per unit ultraviolet light exposure, and (3) non-European Union immigration over the last century. To date, the UK government demonstrates incomplete understanding of these three facts, and its failure to adjust its prevention programmes to changing demographics is endangering the health and life of UK residents with dark skin, of whom infants are the most vulnerable.

29641459,An Overview of Novel Dietary Supplements and Food Ingredients in Patients with Metabolic Syndrome and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterized by interconnected factors related to metabolic disturbances, and is directly related to the occurrence of some diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. MetS is described as one or both of insulin resistance and visceral adiposity, considered the initial causes of abnormalities that include hyperglycemia, elevated blood pressure, dyslipidemia, elevated inflammatory markers, and prothrombotic state, as well as polycystic ovarian syndrome in women. Other than in MetS, visceral adiposity and the pro-inflammatory state are also key in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is the most prevalent chronic liver disease in modern society. Both MetS and NAFLD are related to diet and lifestyle, and their treatment may be influenced by dietary pattern changes and the use of certain dietary supplements. This study aimed to review the role of food ingredients and supplements in the management of MetS and NAFLD specifically in human clinical trials. Moreover, bioactive compounds and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may be used as strategies for preventing the onset of and treatment of metabolic disorders, such as MetS and NAFLD, improving the inflammatory state and other comorbidities, such as obesity, dyslipidemias, and cardiovascular diseases (CVD).",Silva Figueiredo P; Inada AC; Ribeiro Fernandes M; Granja Arakaki D; Freitas KC; Avellaneda Guimarães RC; Aragão do Nascimento V; Aiko Hiane P,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29641459/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29621196,Tannins from Acacia mearnsii De Wild. Bark: Tannin Determination and Biological Activities.,"The bark of <i>Acacia mearnsii</i> De Wild. (black wattle) contains significant amounts of water-soluble components acalled ""wattle tannin"". Following the discovery of its strong antioxidant activity, a wattle tannin dietary supplement has been developed and as part of developing new dietary supplements, a literature search was conducted using the SciFinder data base for ""<i>Acacia</i> species and their biological activities"". An analysis of the references found indicated that the name of <i>Acacia nilotica</i> had been changed to <i>Vachellia nilotica</i>, even though the name of the genus <i>Acacia</i> originated from its original name. This review briefly describes why and how the name of <i>A. nilotica</i> changed. Tannin has been analyzed using the Stiasny method when the tannin is used to make adhesives and the hide-powder method is used when the tannin is to be used for leather tanning. A simple UV method is also able to be used to estimate the values for both adhesives and leather tanning applications. The tannin content in bark can also be estimated using NIR and NMR. Tannin content estimations using pyrolysis/GC, electrospray mass spectrometry and quantitative <sup>31</sup>P-NMR analyses have also been described. Tannins consists mostly of polyflavanoids and all the compounds isolated have been updated. Antioxidant activities of the tannin relating to anti-tumor properties, the viability of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and also anti-hypertensive effects have been studied. The antioxidant activity of proanthocyanidins was found to be higher than that of flavan-3-ol monomers. A total of fourteen papers and two patents reported the antimicrobial activities of wattle tannin. Bacteria were more susceptible to the tannins than the fungal strains tested. Several bacteria were inhibited by the extract from <i>A. mearnsii</i> bark. The growth inhibition mechanisms of <i>E. coli</i> were investigated. An interaction between extracts from <i>A. mearnsii</i> bark and antibiotics has also been studied. The extracts from <i>A. mearnsii</i> bark inhibit the growth of cyanobacteria. Wattle tannin has the ability to inactivate α-amylase, lipase and glucosidase. <i>In vivo</i> experiments on anti-obesity and anti-diabetes were also reported. Several patents relating to these enzymes for anti-diabetes and anti-obesity are in the literature. In addition, studies on <i>Acacia</i> bark extract regarding its antitermite activities, inhibition of itching in atopic dermatitis and anti-inflammatory effects have also been reported. The growth of bacteria was inhibited by the extract from <i>A. mearnsii</i> bark, and typical intestinal bacteria such as <i>E. coli</i>, <i>K. pneumoniae</i>, <i>P. vulgaris</i> and <i>S. marcescenes</i> was also inhibited in vitro by extracts. Based on these results, the <i>Acacia</i> bark extract may inhibit not only the growth of these typical intestinal bacteria but also the growth of other types of intestinal bacteria such as <i>Clostridium</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i>, a so-called ""bad bacteria"". If the tannin extract from <i>A. mearnsii</i> bark inhibits growth of these ""bad bacteria"" <i>in vivo</i> evaluation, the extracts might be usable as a new dietary supplement, which could control the human intestinal microbiome to keep the body healthy.",Ogawa S; Yazaki Y,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29621196/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29601566,[Disturbances of calcium metabolism and vitamin D supplementation in sarcoidosis - two-way street].,"The role of vitamin D in the human body is not limited only to the regulation of calcium metabolism and secondary to the impact on bones. Recent studies have shown the influence of vitamin D level on muscles, on the risk of cancer, diabetes, hypertension and pulmonary diseases, including granulomatous diseases. Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. Hypercalcemia in the course of the disease occurs in up to 10% of cases in the consequence of autonomous overproduction of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by macrophages of sarcoid granulomas. Hypercalciuria occurs 3-fold more frequent. On the other hand, treatment with corticosteroids increases the risk of osteoporosis. Vitamin D intake is recommended for prevention of osteoporosis. Such management, in sarcoidosis patients, is not so clear because of risk of hypercalcemia. Vitamin D supplementation, according to current recommendations for general population, is based solely on 25-hydroxyvitamin D level testing. This seems to be not safe in the group of sarcoidosis patients.

29573851,The Use of Multivitamin/Multimineral Supplements: A Modified Delphi Consensus Panel Report.,"Evidence supporting the use of dietary supplements, in particular, multivitamin/multimineral supplements (MVMS), has been mixed, complicating the ability of health care professionals to recommend their use. To clarify the role that MVMS can play in supporting human health, a series of consensus statements was developed based on expert opinion. A panel of 14 international experts in nutritional science and health care was convened to develop consensus statements related to using MVMS in supporting optimal human health. The modified Delphi process included 2 rounds of remote voting and a final round of voting at a roundtable meeting where evidence summaries were presented and discussed. The level of agreement with each of 9 statements was rated on a 5-point Likert scale: agree strongly; agree with reservation; undecided; disagree; or disagree strongly. Consensus was predefined as ≥80% of the panel agreeing strongly or agreeing with reservation to a given statement. Consensus was reached for all statements. The panel determined that MVMS can broadly improve micronutrient intakes when they contain at least the micronutrients that are consumed insufficiently or have limited bioavailability within a specified population. MVMS formulations may also be individualized according to age, sex, life cycle, and/or other selected characteristics. There are specific biological processes and health outcomes associated with deficient, inadequate, and adequate micronutrient levels. Adequate intake is necessary for normal biological functioning required for good health; in some instances, higher than recommended micronutrient intakes have the potential to provide additional health benefits. Meeting daily intakes established by dietary reference values should be an explicit public health goal for individuals and populations. Use of MVMS is one approach to ensure that adequate micronutrient needs are met in support of biological functions necessary to maintain health. Long-term use of MVMS not exceeding the upper limit of recommended intakes has been determined to be safe in healthy adults. There is insufficient evidence to indicate that MVMS are effective for the primary prevention of chronic medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. However, for certain otherwise healthy subpopulations (eg, pregnant women, older adults) and some individuals with existing medical conditions who experience inadequacies in micronutrient intake, addressing inadequacies by using MVMS can provide health benefits. This consensus panel has described key issues related to the use of MVMS among individuals at risk of or presenting with inadequacies in micronutrient intake or biomarker status.",Blumberg JB; Cena H; Barr SI; Biesalski HK; Dagach RU; Delaney B; Frei B; Moreno González MI; Hwalla N; Lategan-Potgieter R; McNulty H; van der Pols JC; Winichagoon P; Li D,Clinical therapeutics,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29573851/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of omega-3 (food or supplement) on circulating adiponectin in patients with type 2 diabetes through a systematic review of meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials. PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched for relevant studies through May 2016. Two researchers screened and abstracted the literature independently. Pooled estimates were obtained using the random-effects models. Overall, omega-3 increased adiponectin by 0.57 µg/mL (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.15 to 1.31; p=0.01, I-square=74.2% p for heterogeneity <0.001). The source of observed heterogeneity was explored by subgroup analyses. In subgroup analyses, adiponectin levels increased only in those who had consumed omega-3 for more than 8 weeks. This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials suggests that omega-3 in patients with type 2 diabetes increases circulating adiponectin. These findings support the potentially beneficial effects of dietary omega-3 in patients with type 2 diabetes on pathways related to adiponectin metabolism.",Bahreini M; Ramezani AH; Shishehbor F; Mansoori A,Canadian journal of diabetes,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29567080/,0,1,0,1,0,0
29562681,The Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation on Glycemic Control in Type 2 Diabetes Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Observational studies have indicated an inverse association between vitamin D levels and the risk of diabetes, yet evidence from population interventions remains inconsistent. PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched up to September 2017. Data from studies regarding serum 25(OH)D, fasting blood glucose (FBG), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were pooled. Twenty studies (<i>n</i> = 2703) were included in the meta-analysis. Vitamin D supplementation resulted in a significant improvement in serum 25(OH)D levels (weighted mean difference (WMD) = 33.98; 95%CI: 24.60-43.37) and HOMA-IR (standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.57; 95%CI: -1.09~-0.04), but not in other outcomes. However, preferred changes were observed in subgroups as follows: short-term (WMD<sub>FBG</sub> = -8.44; 95%CI: -12.72~-4.15), high dose (WMD<sub>FBG</sub> = -8.70; 95%CI: -12.96~-4.44), non-obese (SMD<sub>Fasting insulin</sub> = -1.80; 95%CI: -2.66~-0.95), Middle Easterners (WMD<sub>FBG</sub> = -10.43; 95%CI: -14.80~-6.06), baseline vitamin D deficient individuals (WMD<sub>FBG</sub> = -5.77; 95%CI: -10.48~-1.05) and well-controlled HbA1c individuals (WMD<sub>FBG</sub> = -4.09; 95%CI: -15.44~7.27). Vitamin D supplementation was shown to increase serum 25(OH)D and reduce insulin resistance effectively. This effect was especially prominent when vitamin D was given in large doses and for a short period of time, and to patients who were non-obese, Middle Eastern, vitamin D deficient, or with optimal glycemic control at baseline.",Li X; Liu Y; Zheng Y; Wang P; Zhang Y,Nutrients,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29562681/,0,1,0,1,0,0
29561197,Impact of Dietary Calcium Supplement on Circulating Lipoprotein Concentrations and Atherogenic Indices in Overweight and Obese Individuals: A Systematic Review.,"Dyslipidemia is the main risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease. There are discrepancies in the effects of calcium supplementation on modulation of lipid status. Therefore, we aimed to summarize the effects of dietary calcium supplement on circulating lipoprotein concentrations and atherogenic indices in overweight and obese individuals. We conducted a systematic literature search from 2000 until July 2016. PubMed, Scopus, Cochran Library, and ISI Web of Science databases were searched for clinical trials written in English. Placebo controlled clinical trials on calcium or calcium with vitamin D supplement in overweight and obese indiciduals were considered. Finally, 11 clinical trials met the criteria and were included. Most studies (n = 9) evaluated Ca/D co-supplementation. Positive effects of calcium supplementation alone or with vitamin D were as follows: serum levels of total cholesterol (TC; n = 1), triglyceride (TG) concentrations (n = 1), serum levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; n = 5) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C; n = 3). Seven clinical trials reported atherogenic indices and three of them demonstrated beneficial effects of calcium supplementation on at least one atherogenic index. Calcium supplementation may not be helpful to reduce serum levels of TC and TG in overweight and obese individuals. However, it may modulate LDL-C and HDL-C concentration. More studies are warranted to clarify the effects of calcium supplementation on each atherogenic index.",Heshmati J; Sepidarkish M; Namazi N; Shokri F; Yavari M; Fazelian S; Khorshidi M; Shidfar F,Journal of dietary supplements,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29561197/,0,1,0,0,0,0

It has been demonstrated that AD, diabetes, obesity, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular disease are strongly interconnected pathologies. Preventive strategies and nutritional interventions seem to be promising approaches to delay neurocognitive decline and reduce the risk of AD and other non-psychiatric co-morbidities. In this regard, healthy dietary patterns, characterized by high intake of plant-based foods, probiotics, antioxidants, soy beans, nuts, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and a low intake of saturated fats, animal-derived proteins, and refined sugars, have been shown to decrease the risk of neurocognitive impairments and eventually the onset of AD. Here we review the role of some nutrients and, in particular, of healthy dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet and other emerging healthy diets, DASH (Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension) and MIND (Mediterranean-DASH dietIntervention for Neurodegenerative Delay), for the maintenance of cognitive performance, focusing specifically on human studies. The beneficial effects associated with overall diet composition, rather than single nutrient supplementations, for the prevention or the delay of AD and dementia are discussed.",Pistollato F; Iglesias RC; Ruiz R; Aparicio S; Crespo J; Lopez LD; Manna PP; Giampieri F; Battino M,Pharmacological research,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29555333/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The dysregulated fatty acid metabolism along with tissue lipid accumulation is generally assumed to be associated in the development of insulin resistance and T2D. Moreover, several studies suggest a central role for oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of the disease. Since L-carnitine (LC) has an indispensable role in lipid metabolism via its involvement in the β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids and it has antioxidant properties as well, carnitine supplementation may prove to be an effective tool in the management of the clinical course of T2D. In this review we summarize the results from animal and clinical studies demonstrating the effects of supplementation with LC or LC derivatives (acetyl-LC, propionyl-LC) on various metabolic and clinical parameters associated with T2D.",Bene J; Hadzsiev K; Melegh B,Nutrition & diabetes,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29549241/,1,0,0,0,0,0

29541947,Natural antioxidants in prevention of accelerated ageing: a departure from conventional paradigms required.,"The modern lifestyle is characterised by various factors that cause accelerating ageing by the upregulation of oxidative stress and inflammation-two processes that are inextricably linked in an endless circle of self-propagation. Inflammation in particular is commonly accepted as aetiological factor in many chronic disease states, such as obesity, diabetes and depression. In terms of disease prevention or treatment, interventions aimed at changing dietary and/or exercise habits have had limited success in practise, mostly due to poor long-term compliance. Furthermore, other primary stimuli responsible for eliciting an oxidative stress or inflammatory response-e.g. psychological stress and anxiety-cannot always be easily addressed. Thus, preventive medicine aimed at countering the oxidative stress and/or inflammatory responses has become of interest. Especially in developing countries, such as South Africa, the option of development of effective strategies from plants warrants further investigation. A brief overview of the most relevant and promising South African plants which have been identified in the context of inflammation, oxidative stress and chronic disease is provided here. In addition, and more specifically, our group and others have shown considerable beneficial effects across many models, after treatment with products derived from grapes. Of particular interest, specific cellular mechanisms have been identified as therapeutic targets of grape-derived polyphenols in the context of inflammation and oxidative stress. The depth of these studies afforded some additional insights, related to methodological considerations pertaining to animal vs. human models in natural product research, which may address the current tendency for generally poor translation of positive animal model results into human in vivo models.

29534257,Therapeutic Perspectives on Chia Seed and Its Oil: A Review.,"The attraction of novel foods proceeds alongside epidemic cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and related risk factors. Dieticians have identified chia (<i>Salvia hispanica</i>) as a product with a catalog of potential health benefits relating to these detriments. Chia is currently consumed not only as seeds, but also as oil, which brings about similar effects. Chia seeds and chia seed oil are used mainly as a food commodity and the oil is also used popularly as a dietary ingredient used in various dietary supplements available in the U. S. market. Chia seed is rich in <i>α</i>-linolenic acid, the biological precursor to eicosapentaenoic acid, a polyunsaturated fatty acid, and docosahexaenoic acid. Because the body cannot synthesize <i>α</i>-linolenic acid, chia has a newfound and instrumental role in diet. However, the inconclusive nature of the scientific community's understanding of its safety warrants further research and appropriate testing. The focus of this work is to summarize dietary health benefits of <i>S. hispanica</i> seed and oil to acknowledge concerns of adverse events from its ingestion, to assess current research in the field, and to highlight the importance of quality compendial standards to support safe use. To achieve this end, a large-scale literature search was partaken on the two well-known databases, PubMed and SciFinder. Hundreds of articles detailing such benefits as decreased blood glucose, decreased waist circumference and weight in overweight adults, and improvements in pruritic skin and endurance in distance runners have been recorded.

Vitamin K supplementation might have favorable effect on risk factors of T2DM. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of interventional studies to examine the effect of vitamin K supplementation on glycemic indices. A systematic search was performed in electronic databases including PubMed, Science Direct, ProQuest, Institute of Scientific Information Web of Science, and Google scholar up to July 2017. We used a random effects model to estimate pooled effect size of fasting blood sugar (FBS), 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (2-h OGTT), fasting insulin (FINS), and homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Five clinical trials (533 participants) fulfilled the eligibility criteria of the present meta-analysis. Overall, meta-analysis could not show any beneficial effect of vitamin K supplementation on FBS (-0.91 mg/dl, 95% CI: -2.57, 0.76, p=0.28), FINS (-0.35 μIU/ml, 95% CI: -1.70, 1.00, p=0.61), HOMA-IR (-0.06, 95% CI: -0.32, -0.19, p=0.63), and 2-h OGTT (-4.00 mg/dl, 95% CI: -20.00, 11.99, p=0.62). Sensitivity analysis showed that overall estimates were not affected by elimination of any study. We did not observe any evidence regarding publication bias. In conclusion, vitamin K supplementation had no signiﬁcant effect on glycemic control in healthy subjects.

Several studies have been carried out on the effect of chromium supplementation in improving PCOS patients. This study aimed to summarize the available findings regarding the effect of chromium on improving the polycystic ovary syndrome. The review includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing chromium treatment with placebo or other treatments in women with PCOS. Women with PCOS diagnosed according to the ESHRE/ASRM or NIH criteria in reproductive age were eligible. Electronic searches using the MeSH terms were conducted in the following databases: Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library. Effects were measured as weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for studies of PCOS and control subjects were calculated by using random-effects model. The initial search yielded potentially 100 relevant articles of randomized clinical trials on dietary chromium supplements: 16 from Pubmed, 36 from Embase, 29 from Scopus, and 19 from Web of Science. After studying these publications, 5 were potentially eligible and retrieved in full text. The five studies included in the meta-analysis reported data on 137 women with PCOS and 131 controls. A meta-analysis of 5 studies showed a non-significant difference in fasting insulin between chromium, and placebo or other treatment (mean difference (MD): -1.14; (95% CI: -4.11 to 1.83, p=0.45). We retrieved two randomized controlled trials, in which Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI) was compared between chromium, and placebo or other treatment in 156 women with PCOS. Meta-analysis of two RCTs showed no significant difference in QUICKI score between chromium and placebo (MD: 0.01; 95% CI: -0.01 to 0.04, p=0.34). Two randomized controlled trials compared Homeostatic Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) between chromium, and placebo or other treatment in 81 women with PCOS. After combining the data, there was a significantly lower HOMA-IR in the chromium group (MD: -1.68; 95% CI: -2.42 to -0.94, p<0.001). One RCT reported a significant difference in Homeostatic Model Assessment-beta-cell function (HOMA-B) between chromium and placebo groups (-15.5±32.3 vs. +13.6±23.1, p<0.001). No significant effect of chromium on fasting insulin and QUICKI score was found in women with PCOS. Chromium supplementation significantly improved HOMA-IR and HOMA-B among patients with diabetes. The magnitude of the effect is small, and the clinical relevance is uncertain. Future trials in well characterized studies that address the limitations in the current evidence are needed before definitive claims can be made about the effect of chromium supplementation.",Heshmati J; Omani-Samani R; Vesali S; Maroufizadeh S; Rezaeinejad M; Razavi M; Sepidarkish M,Hormone and metabolic research = Hormon- und Stoffwechselforschung = Hormones et metabolisme,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29523006/,0,1,0,1,0,0
29510494,Effects of the Usage of l-Cysteine (l-Cys) on Human Health.,"This review summarizes recent knowledge about the use of the amino acid l-Cysteine (l-Cys) through diet, nutritional supplements or drugs with the aim to improve human health or treat certain diseases. Three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) and different keywords have been used to create a database of documents published between 1950 and 2017 in scientific journals in English or Spanish. A total of 60,885 primary publications were ultimately selected to compile accurate information about the use of l-Cys in medicine and nutritional therapies and to identify the reported benefits of l-Cys on human health. The number of publications about the use of l-Cys for these purposes has increased significantly during the last two decades. This increase seems to be closely related to the rise of nutraceutical industries and personalized medicine. The main evidence reporting benefits of l-Cys usage is summarized. However, the lack of accurate information and studies based on clinical trials hampers consensus among authors. Thus, the debate about the role and effectiveness of supplements/drugs containing l-Cys is still open.",Clemente Plaza N; Reig García-Galbis M; Martínez-Espinosa RM,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29510494/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29501221,The effects of folate supplementation on glucose metabolism and risk of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Observationally, homocysteine is associated with higher risk of diabetes. Folate, which reduces homocysteine, is promising for the prevention and treatment of diabetes. Previous meta-analysis of three trials suggested folate might lower hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>). An updated systematic review and meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomized trials was conducted. We searched PubMed using (""folate"" or ""folic acid"") and trial and (""glucose"" or ""diabetes"" or ""insulin"" or ""hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub>"" or ""HbA<sub>1c</sub>"") in any field until February 3, 2017. We also conducted a bibliographic search of selected studies and relevant reviews. Relative risk of diabetes and mean differences in indicators of glucose metabolism between folate and placebo were summarized in a meta-analysis using inverse variance weighting with random effects. Heterogeneity, publication bias, and risk of bias were also assessed. Eighteen trials of 21,081 people with/without diabetes were identified. Folate decreased fasting glucose (-0.15 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.29 to -0.01), homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (-0.83, 95% CI -1.31 to -0.34), and insulin (-1.94 μIU/mL, 95% CI -3.28 to -0.61) but had no clear effect on diabetes or HbA<sub>1c</sub>. Our study suggests a potential benefit of folate on insulin resistance and glycemic control; the latter requires examination in more high-quality trials.",Zhao JV; Schooling CM; Zhao JX,Annals of epidemiology,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29501221/,0,1,0,1,0,0
29490085,Vitamin D supplementation for improvement of chronic low-grade inflammation in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Vitamin D has been proposed to have anti-inflammatory properties; however, the effect of vitamin D supplementation on inflammation in type 2 diabetes has not been established. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on inflammatory markers in patients with type 2 diabetes and to identify relevant gaps in knowledge. MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, and EBM Reviews were searched systematically from inception to January 25, 2017. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of vitamin D supplementation (any form, route, and duration, and with any cosupplementation) compared with placebo or usual care on inflammatory markers in patients with type 2 diabetes were selected. Study and sample characteristics and aggregate outcome data were extracted, risk of bias was determined, and quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Twenty-eight RCTs were included, 20 of which had data available for pooling. In meta-analyses of 20 RCTs (n = 1270 participants), vitamin D-supplemented groups had lower levels of C-reactive protein (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.23; 95%CI, -0.37 to -0.09; P = 0.002) and tumor necrosis factor α (SMD -0.49; 95%CI, -0.84 to -0.15; P = 0.005), a lower erythrocyte sedimentation rate (SMD -0.47; 95%CI, -0.89 to -0.05; P = 0.03), and higher levels of leptin (SMD 0.42; 95%CI, 0.04-0.81; P = 0.03) compared with control groups. No differences were observed for adiponectin, interleukin 6, or E-selectin (all P > 0.05). In meta-regression and subgroup analyses, age, sex, body mass index, duration of diabetes, baseline vitamin D status, and dose and duration of supplementation did not alter the results. This meta-analysis provides level 1 evidence that vitamin D supplementation may reduce chronic low-grade inflammation in patients with type 2 diabetes. PROSPERO CRD42016047755.

29480736,Are Isolated and Complex Fiber Supplements Good Choices for Weight Management? A Systematic Review.,"Previous trials have reported beneficial effects of isolated and complex fiber supplements in obesity treatment. However, recommending fiber supplements in obese subjects remains controversial. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic review has updated the data on the effects of fiber supplements on obesity since 2010 and the need exists for a systematic review on this topic. Accordingly, a systematic review was undertaken to summarize the efficacy of different types of fiber supplements as a complementary treatment for weight management. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar between January 2010 to August 2016 with no language restriction. Considering the inclusion/exclusion criteria and quality assessment score, finally 17 clinical trials met the eligibility criteria and were included. The present study indicated that the efficacy of various fiber supplements on losing weight is variable. Several mechanisms related to physicochemical properties of fibers such as solubility, fermentability and viscosity rates can be involved in their anti-obesity effects. Dextrin, Mannan (gum Arabic) and pectin-rich fiber (lupin kernel) with no dietary interventions indicated a reduction in body weight and energy intake, while from clinical point of view, their effects were not considerable. Overall, findings indicated that the efficacy of fiber supplements on obesity management is dependent on their contents and physicochemical properties. It seems that fiber supplements with no weight-loss interventions did not have considerable antiobesity effects. However, due to limited studies on each type of fiber, findings should be declared by caution. Additional research is needed on comparison of different fiber supplements in similar conditions to clarify the best type and dosage of fiber supplement as a complementary therapy in obesity management.",Namazi N; Larijani B; Azadbakht L,Archives of Iranian medicine,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29480736/,0,1,0,0,0,0
29453657,The effect of L-carnitine supplementation on serum leptin concentrations: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"The actual effects of L-carnitine administration on leptin serum level is inconsistent. In order to assess the efficacy of L-carnitine supplementation on serum leptin we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Seven studies with 325 cases and 330 controls were included. The pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated by random-effects model. The heterogeneity across studies was evaluated by using Cochrane's Q and I<sup>2</sup> tests. In addition, we carried out the metaninf command to test the effect of each individual study on the overall result. L-carnitine supplementation seemed to have no significant effect on serum leptin concentrations (WMD: -0.565 ng/mL; 95% CI: -2.417 to 1.287, p = 0.550). However, between-study heterogeneity was higher across all studies (I<sup>2</sup> = 84.3%, p < 0.0001). Subgroup analysis to find the sources of heterogeneity showed that L-carnitine dosage (g) ( < 2 g: I<sup>2</sup> = 00.0%, p = 0.408), and study population (diabetes: I<sup>2</sup> = 46.7%, p = 0.153, and non-diabetes: I<sup>2</sup> = 15.1%, p = 0.317) were the potential sources of heterogeneity. Besides, a more significant reduction in serum leptin concentration was observed with a daily dose of ≥ 2 mg L-carnitine (WMD: -2.742 ng/mL; 95% CI: -3.039 to -2.444, p < 0.001), in diabetic patients (WMD: -2.946 ng/mL; 95% CI: -3.254 to -2.638, p < 0.001), and with intervention duration <12 weeks (WMD: -2.772 ng/mL; 95% CI: -3.073 to -2.471, p < 0.001). L-carnitine consumption does not reduce serum leptin significantly. However, a significant effect on leptin was observed in diabetic patients and patients who received doses more than 3 mg per day in the course of <12 weeks.",Nazary-Vannani A; Ghaedi E; Mousavi SM; Teymouri A; Rahmani J; Varkaneh HK,Endocrine,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29453657/,0,1,0,1,0,0
29452774,"Dietary zinc intake and whole blood zinc concentration in subjects with type 2 diabetes versus healthy subjects: A systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression.","The aim of this systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression was to examine the relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and concentration of zinc in whole blood, as well as dietary zinc intake. Searches were performed using Ovid MEDLINE, Embase (Ovid) and The Cochrane Library (CENTRAL). Observational studies conducted on diabetic and healthy adults, with data on dietary zinc intake and/or concentration of zinc in whole blood, were selected. The search strategy yielded 11,150 publications and the manual search 6, of which 11 were included in the meta-analyses. Mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI), were calculated using the generic inverse-variance method with random-effects models. Heterogeneity was assessed by the Cochran Q-statistic and quantified by the I<sup>2</sup> statistic. Meta-regressions and stratified analysis were used to examine whether any covariate had influence on the results. The pooled MD for the dietary zinc intake meta-analysis was -0.40 (95% CI: -1.59 to 0.79; I<sup>2</sup> = 61.0%). Differences between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects became significant in the presence of complications associated with diabetes (MD = -2.26; 95% CI: -3.49 to -1.02; I<sup>2</sup> = 11.9%).

29441149,Supplementation of Micronutrient Selenium in Metabolic Diseases: Its Role as an Antioxidant.,"Selenium is an essential mineral naturally found in soil, water, and some of the food. As an antioxidant, it is one of the necessary trace elements in human body and has been suggested as a dietary supplement for health benefit. Although the human body only needs a trace amount of selenium every day, plenty of recent studies have revealed that selenium is indispensable for maintaining normal functions of metabolism. In this study, we reviewed the antioxidant role of nutritional supplementation of selenium in the management of major chronic metabolic disorders, including hyperlipidaemia, hyperglycaemia, and hyperphenylalaninemia. Clinical significance of selenium deficiency in chronic metabolic diseases was elaborated, while clinical and experimental observations of dietary supplementation of selenium in treating chronic metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, arteriosclerosis, and phenylketonuria, were summarized. Toxicity and recommended dose of selenium were discussed. The mechanism of action was also proposed via inspecting the interaction of molecular networks and predicting target protein such as xanthine dehydrogenase in various diseases. Future direction in studying the role of selenium in metabolic disorders was also highlighted. In conclusion, highlighting the beneficial role of selenium in this review would advance our knowledge of the dietary management of chronic metabolic diseases.",Wang N; Tan HY; Li S; Xu Y; Guo W; Feng Y,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29441149/,1,0,0,0,0,0

29415457,Role of Zinc Homeostasis in the Pathogenesis of Diabetes and Obesity.,"Zinc deficiency is a risk factor for obesity and diabetes. However, until recently, the underlying molecular mechanisms remained unclear. The breakthrough discovery that the common polymorphism in zinc transporter <i>SLC30A8</i>/ZnT8 may increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes provided novel insights into the role of zinc in diabetes. Our group and others showed that altered ZnT8 function may be involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, indicating that the precise control of zinc homeostasis is crucial for maintaining health and preventing various diseases, including lifestyle-associated diseases. Recently, the role of the zinc transporter ZIP13 in the regulation of beige adipocyte biogenesis was clarified, which indicated zinc homeostasis regulation as a possible therapeutic target for obesity and metabolic syndrome. Here we review advances in the role of zinc homeostasis in the pathophysiology of diabetes, and propose that inadequate zinc distribution may affect the onset of diabetes and metabolic diseases by regulating various critical biological events.",Fukunaka A; Fujitani Y,International journal of molecular sciences,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29415457/,1,0,0,0,0,0

29394028,Health Benefits of Vanadium and Its Potential as an Anticancer Agent.,"Vanadium compounds have been known to have beneficial therapeutic properties since the turn of the century, but it was not until 1965 when it was discovered that those effects could be extended to treating cancer. Some vanadium compounds can combat common markers of cancer, which include metabolic processes that are important to initiating and developing the phenotypes of cancer. It is appropriate to consider vanadium as a treatment option due to the similarities in some of the metabolic pathways utilized by both diabetes and cancer and therefore is among the few drugs that are effective against more than one disease. The development of vanadium compounds as protein phosphatase inhibitors for the treatment of diabetes may be useful for potential applications as an anticancer agent. Furthermore, the ability of vanadium to redox cycle is also important for biological properties and is involved in the pathways of reactive oxygen species. Early agents including vanadocene and peroxovanadium compounds have been investigated in detail, and the results can be used to gain a better understanding of how some vanadium compounds are modifying the metabolic pathways potentially developing cancer. Considering the importance of coordination chemistry to biological responses, it is likely that proper consideration of compound formulation will improve the efficacy of the drug. Future development of vanadium-based drugs should include consideration of drug formulation at earlier stages of drug development.",Crans DC; Yang L; Haase A; Yang X,Metal ions in life sciences,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29394028/,1,0,0,0,0,0

A growing body of evidence from epidemiological studies, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses have indicated inverse associations between Mg intake and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The present review aims to summarize recent scientific evidence on the topic, with a focus on data from epidemiological studies assessing the associations between Mg intake and major cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and CVD. We also aimed to review current literature on circulating Mg and CVD, as well as potential biological processes underlying these observations. We concluded that high Mg intake is associated with lower risk of major CV risk factors (mainly metabolic syndrome, diabetes and hypertension), stroke and total CVD. Higher levels of circulating Mg are associated with lower risk of CVD, mainly ischemic heart disease and coronary heart disease. Further, RCTs and prospective studies would help to clarify whether Mg intake and Mg circulating levels may also protect against other CVDs and CVD death.",Rosique-Esteban N; Guasch-Ferré M; Hernández-Alonso P; Salas-Salvadó J,Nutrients,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29389872/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29387889,Associations of Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplement Use With Cardiovascular Disease Risks: Meta-analysis of 10 Trials Involving 77 917 Individuals.,"Current guidelines advocate the use of marine-derived omega-3 fatty acids supplements for the prevention of coronary heart disease and major vascular events in people with prior coronary heart disease, but large trials of omega-3 fatty acids have produced conflicting results. To conduct a meta-analysis of all large trials assessing the associations of omega-3 fatty acid supplements with the risk of fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease and major vascular events in the full study population and prespecified subgroups. This meta-analysis included randomized trials that involved at least 500 participants and a treatment duration of at least 1 year and that assessed associations of omega-3 fatty acids with the risk of vascular events. Aggregated study-level data were obtained from 10 large randomized clinical trials. Rate ratios for each trial were synthesized using observed minus expected statistics and variances. Summary rate ratios were estimated by a fixed-effects meta-analysis using 95% confidence intervals for major diseases and 99% confidence intervals for all subgroups. The main outcomes included fatal coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, major vascular events, and all-cause mortality, as well as major vascular events in study population subgroups. Of the 77 917 high-risk individuals participating in the 10 trials, 47 803 (61.4%) were men, and the mean age at entry was 64.0 years; the trials lasted a mean of 4.4 years. The associations of treatment with outcomes were assessed on 6273 coronary heart disease events (2695 coronary heart disease deaths and 2276 nonfatal myocardial infarctions) and 12 001 major vascular events. Randomization to omega-3 fatty acid supplementation (eicosapentaenoic acid dose range, 226-1800 mg/d) had no significant associations with coronary heart disease death (rate ratio [RR], 0.93; 99% CI, 0.83-1.03; P = .05), nonfatal myocardial infarction (RR, 0.97; 99% CI, 0.87-1.08; P = .43) or any coronary heart disease events (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.90-1.01; P = .12).

However, Mendelian randomization studies do not support these findings. Although meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) do not rule out small beneficial vitamin D effects on surrogate parameters of CVD risk, such as arterial stiffness, at vitamin D doses equivalent to 1,000-5,333 IU daily, other meta-analyses of RCTs show no reduction in CVD events by vitamin D supplementation. Notably, some cohort studies and a recent RCT provide evidence for harmful effects of vitamin D on CVD outcomes at 25(OH)D levels in excess of 100 nmol/l. In conclusion, more studies in individuals with a deficient 25(OH)D level (i.e. <30 nmol/l) are needed, but caution is necessary regarding supplementation with vitamin D doses achieving a 25(OH)D level which exceeds 100 nmol/l.",Zittermann A,Anticancer research,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29374756/,1,0,0,0,0,1

Natural products, such as ginger, curcumin, and gingko biloba have been used as diets and dietary supplements to treat human diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular, respiratory, infectious, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndromes, and neurological disorders. Products derived from plants are known to have protective effects, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-arthritis, pro-healing, and boosting memory cognitive functions. In the last decade, several groups have designed and synthesized curcumin and its derivatives and extensively tested using cell and mouse models of AD. Recent research on Aβ and curcumin has revealed that curcumin prevents Aβ aggregation and crosses the blood-brain barrier, reach brain cells, and protect neurons from various toxic insults of aging and Aβ in humans. Recent research has also reported that curcumin ameliorates cognitive decline and improves synaptic functions in mouse models of AD. Further, recent groups have initiated studies on elderly individuals and patients with AD and the outcome of these studies is currently being assessed. This article highlights the beneficial effects of curcumin on AD. This article also critically assesses the current limitations of curcumin's bioavailability and urgent need for new formulations to increase its brain levels to treat patients with AD.",Reddy PH; Manczak M; Yin X; Grady MC; Mitchell A; Tonk S; Kuruva CS; Bhatti JS; Kandimalla R; Vijayan M; Kumar S; Wang R; Pradeepkiran JA; Ogunmokun G; Thamarai K; Quesada K; Boles A; Reddy AP,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29332042/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Patients frequently discontinue statin therapy without medical advice because of perceived side effects and consequently increase their risk for cardiovascular events. In patients with statin intolerance, it may be advisable to change the dose, switch to a different statin, or try an alternate-day regimen. If intolerance is associated with all statins-even at the lowest dose-non-statin drugs and certain nutraceuticals can be considered.

About 80% of heart disease (heart attacks, angina, coronary heart disease and congestive heart failure) can be prevented by optimal nutrition, optimal exercise, optimal weight and body composition, mild alcohol intake and avoiding smoking. Statistics show that approximately 50% of patients continue to have CHD or myocardial infarction (MI) despite presently defined 'normal' levels of the five risk factors listed above. This is often referred to as the 'CHD gap'. Novel and more accurate definitions and evaluations of these top five risk factors are required, such as 24 h ambulatory blood pressure (ABM) results, advanced lipid profiles, redefined fasting and 2 h dysglycemia parameters, a focus on visceral obesity and body composition and the effects of adipokines on cardiovascular risk. There are numerous traumatic insults from the environment that damage the cardiovascular system but there are only three finite vascular endothelial responses, which are inflammation, oxidative stress and immune vascular dysfunction. In addition, the concept of translational cardiovascular medicine is mandatory in order to correlate the myriad of CHD risk factors to the presence or absence of functional or structural damage to the vascular system, preclinical and clinical CHD. This can be accomplished by utilizing advanced and updated CV risk scoring systems, new and redefined CV risk factors and biomarkers, micronutrient testing, cardiovascular genetics, nutrigenomics, metabolomics, genetic expression testing and noninvasive cardiovascular testing.",Houston M,Therapeutic advances in cardiovascular disease,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29316855/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We present information from completed and ongoing clinical trials examining Rx omega-3s for TG-lowering and omega-3 dietary supplements to highlight important differences affecting patient management for nurse practitioners. Rx omega-3s demonstrate robust reductions in TGs and may have a role in reducing residual cardiovascular risk. Products containing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may raise LDL-C and should not be substituted for Rx eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-only icosapent ethyl, which does not raise LDL-C. Omega-3 dietary supplements (e.g., fish oils containing EPA and DHA) may be used for general health promotion; however, they are not regulated as medications and concerns regarding quality, purity, safety, and variability of content exist. It is important to advise patients that omega-3 dietary supplements are not medications and should not be substituted for Rx omega-3s. Large-scale cardiovascular outcomes studies are underway for Rx omega-3s in statin-treated patients. Nurse practitioners can take an active role in reducing residual cardiovascular risk and educating patients about important differences between Rx omega-3s and fish oil supplements.",Gutstein AS; Copple T,Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29280361/,1,0,0,0,0,0

29262380,"Vitamin D: Effects on human reproduction, pregnancy, and fetal well-being.","Pregnancy places exceptional demands on vitamin D and calcium availability; thus, their deficiencies during pregnancy threaten the woman and her fetus. Globally, vitamin D and other micronutrient deficiencies are common during pregnancy, especially in developing countries where pregnant women have less access to nutritional supplements. Vitamin D deficiency has been reported to be as high as 40% among pregnant women. As a pregnancy progresses, the requirements for vitamin D increase and thus, can worsen preexisting hypovitaminosis D. Consequently, hypovitaminosis D is increasingly associated with a higher incidence of fetal miscarriage, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, bacterial vaginosis, and impaired fetal and childhood growth and development. This review explores the recent advances in the understanding of vitamin D and the pivotal role it plays in human reproduction, with an emphasis on pregnancy and its outcomes. Given the seriousness of the issue, there is a pressing need for clinicians to become aware of the risks associated with not identifying and correcting vitamin D deficiency. Identifying and correcting vitamin D deficiency, including safe exposure to sunlight, is particularly relevant for those who seek assistance with fertility issues or prenatal counseling, and those in the beginning of their pregnancy. The data point to a significant protective effects of vitamin D during pregnancy when the 25(OH)D serum level exceeds 30 ng/mL before pregnancy and during the first trimester and, sufficient levels are maintained throughout the pregnancy.",Heyden EL; Wimalawansa SJ,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29262380/,1,0,0,0,0,0

To evaluate the relationship between vitamin D and GDM. EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library and China Biology Medicine disc were searched up to May 2017. The references of previous studies were screened. Observational studies on the relationship between vitamin D and GDM free from Hawthorne effect and randomised controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy for preventing or treating GDM were included. Data and information of included articles were extracted by duplicate using piloted tables. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Cochrane Handbook were used for quality assessment. Random-effects models were used for meta-analyses. Heterogeneity tests, sensitivity analysis and analysis of publication bias were conducted. Eighty-seven observational studies and 25 randomised controlled trials involving 55 859 and 2445 women, respectively, were included. Low blood vitamin D level during pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of GDM (OR 1.850, 95% CI 1.471-2.328). Blood vitamin D level for women with GDM were lower than in the control women. Blood vitamin D level was associated with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and homeostasis model of assessment for insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) (r = -0.100 and r = -0.351), whereas the correlation between blood vitamin D level and fasting insulin (FINS) might be concealed by publication bias. Vitamin D intervention during pregnancy could change the blood levels of vitamin D, FINS, FPG, HOMA-IR, glutathione, C-reactive protein and lipid. Low blood vitamin D level could increase the risk of GDM, and vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy could ameliorate the condition of GDM.

Traditional medicines worldwide suggest a wide range of natural remedies for the prevention and treatment of chronic disorders, including diabetes mellitus. This mechanistic review aims to highlight the significance of medicinal plants traditionally used as dietary supplements in Persian medicine in adjunct with restricted conventional drugs for the prevention and treatment of diabetes mellitus. Mounting evidence suggests that these natural agents perform their protective and therapeutic effect on diabetes mellitus via several cellular mechanisms, including regeneration of pancreatic β cell, limitation of glycogen degradation and gluconeogenesis, anti-inflammatory, immunoregulatory, antiapoptosis, antioxidative stress, as well as modulation of intracellular signaling transduction pathways. In conclusion, traditional medicinal plants used in Persian medicine can be considered as dietary supplements with therapeutic potential for diabetes mellitus and maybe potential sources of new orally active agent(s).",Farzaei F; Morovati MR; Farjadmand F; Farzaei MH,Journal of evidence-based complementary & alternative medicine,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29228789/,1,0,0,0,0,0

29210994,Iron Supplementation during Pregnancy and Infancy: Uncertainties and Implications for Research and Policy.,"Iron is particularly important in pregnancy and infancy to meet the high demands for hematopoiesis, growth and development. Much attention has been given to conditions of iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficient anemia (IDA) because of the high global prevalence estimated in these vulnerable life stages. Emerging and preliminary evidence demonstrates, however, a U-shaped risk at both low and high iron status for birth and infant adverse health outcomes including growth, preterm birth, gestational diabetes, gastrointestinal health, and neurodegenerative diseases during aging. Such evidence raises questions about the effects of high iron intakes through supplementation or food fortification during pregnancy and infancy in iron-replete individuals. This review examines the emerging as well as the current understanding of iron needs and homeostasis during pregnancy and infancy, uncertainties in ascertaining iron status in these populations, and issues surrounding U-shaped risk curves in iron-replete pregnant women and infants. Implications for research and policy are discussed relative to screening and supplementation in these vulnerable populations, especially in developed countries in which the majority of these populations are likely iron-replete.",Brannon PM; Taylor CL,Nutrients,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29210994/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The objective of this review was to perform an umbrella summary of meta-analyses to evaluate the effects and associations of iron supplementation or iron status on maternal and birth/neonatal outcomes. A literature search was conducted on PubMed and Scopus by two reviewers without temporal restriction. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies evaluating (1) the effects of multimicronutrient compared to iron + folic acid supplementations on maternal and birth/neonatal outcomes (2), the association of dietary iron intake or hemoglobin or ferritin status regarding the risk for maternal (gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)) and birth/neonatal outcomes, and (3) the effects of iron supplementation on pregnancy and birth/neonatal outcomes, were included in this review. Overall, 16 meta-analyses were included. Multimicronutrient supplements had significant risk reducing effects on low birth weight and small for gestational age compared to iron/folic acid supplements as controls. Furthermore, most of the meta-analyses showed that higher levels of hemoglobin or ferritin increased the risk for GDM. On the other hand, maternal anemia (low hemoglobin levels) was associated with adverse birth/neonatal outcomes. Finally, iron supplementation reduced the risk of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia and had some risk reducing effects on low birth weight newborns. Our summary of meta-analyses showed that multimicronutrient supplementation had beneficial effects on some neonatal outcomes. Furthermore, higher ferritin levels seem to increase the risk for GDM whereas maternal anemia was associated with adverse birth/neonatal outcomes.",Iqbal S; Ekmekcioglu C,"The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29207894/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The key factors known to lead to its development include hyperglycemia, hypertension, and the duration of diabetes. Though the diet is important in the development of diabetes, its role in diabetic retinopathy has not been clearly identified. In this systematic review, we aimed to identify, summarize and interpret the literature on the association between the diet and dietary intakes of specific foods, nutrients, and food groups, and the risk of diabetic retinopathy. We searched PubMed and Web of Science for English-language studies evaluating the association between the dietary intake of individual foods, macro or micronutrients, dietary supplements, and dietary patterns and their association with retinopathy or macular edema. After reviewing potentially relevant abstracts and, when necessary, full texts, we identified 27 relevant studies. Identified studies investigated intakes of fruit, vegetables, fish, milk, carbohydrates, fibre, fat, protein, salt, potassium, vitamins C, D, and E, carotenoids, dietary supplements, green tea and alcohol. Studies suggest that adherence to the Mediterranean diet and high fruit, vegetable and fish intake may protect against the development of diabetic retinopathy, although the evidence is limited.

Accumulating evidence indicates that regular consumption of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), the main source of fat in the Mediterranean diet, is associated with a reduced risk of developing chronic degenerative disorders such as cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes and cancer. The beneficial effects on health of EVOO have been attributed, besides to the monounsaturated fats content, to the presence of phenolic compounds that have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the effects of EVOO polyphenols on IMID highlighting the potential mechanisms of action. Scientific papers were found by searching in PubMed up to May 2017 using the following key words: rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and psoriasis also in combination with EVOO, phenolic compounds, oleuropein, oleocantal, hydroxytyrosol,tyrosol and oleochantal. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that EVOO and its polyphenols can improve diseases symptoms in IMID, by acting both at local and systemic levels and by modulating several molecular pathways.

Treatment with high doses of pharmacologic-grade omega-3 fatty acid (n-3FA) supplements achieves significant reductions in triglycerides (TG), non-high-density lipoprotein- (non-HDL-) and TG-rich lipoprotein- (TRL-) cholesterol levels. n-3FA supplements have significant effects on markers of atherosclerosis risk including endothelial function, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation, cellular and humoral markers of inflammation, hemodynamic factors, and plaque stabilization. This review summarizes the lipid and cardiometabolic effects of prescription-grade n-3FAs and will discuss clinical trials, national/organizational guidelines, and expert opinion on the impact of supplemental n-3FAs on CV health and disease. Clinical trial evidence supports use of n-3FAs in individuals with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), but the data either does not support or is lacking for other types of cardiometabolic risk including prevention of stroke, treatment in patients with heart failure, diabetes mellitus and prediabetes, and for primary prevention in the general population. Despite inconsistent findings to support widespread benefit, there is persistent population-wide enthusiasm for n-3FA as a dietary supplement for its cardiometabolic benefits. Fortunately, there are ongoing clinical trials to assess whether the lipid/lipoprotein benefits may be extended to other at-risk populations and whether lower-dose therapy may provide background benefit for primary prevention of ASCVD.",Burke MF; Burke FM; Soffer DE,Current atherosclerosis reports,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29116404/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29102433,Effect of vitamin D supplementation on non-skeletal disorders: a systematic review of meta-analyses and randomised trials.,"Randomised trials reported up to Dec 31, 2012, did not confirm that vitamin D supplementation could protect from non-skeletal health conditions affecting adults, as was expected on the basis of data from observational studies. To examine whether the more recently published meta-analyses and trials would change past conclusions, we systematically reviewed meta-analyses of vitamin D supplementation and non-skeletal disorders published between Jan 1, 2013, and May 31, 2017, that included study participants of all ages, including pregnant women. We also searched for randomised trials not included in meta-analyses. We identified 87 meta-analyses, of which 52 were excluded because they contained less recent literature or were of suboptimal quality. We retrieved 202 articles on trials that were not included in meta-analyses. Recent meta-analyses reinforce the finding that 10-20 μg per day of vitamin D can reduce all-cause mortality and cancer mortality in middle-aged and older people. Although vitamin D doses were greater than those assessed in the past, we found no new evidence that supplementation could have an effect on most non-skeletal conditions, including cardiovascular disease, adiposity, glucose metabolism, mood disorders, muscular function, tuberculosis, and colorectal adenomas, or on maternal and perinatal conditions. New data on cancer outcomes were scarce. The compilation of results from 83 trials showed that vitamin D supplementation had no significant effect on biomarkers of systemic inflammation. The main new finding highlighted by this systematic review is that vitamin D supplementation might help to prevent common upper respiratory tract infections and asthma exacerbations. There remains little evidence to suggest that vitamin D supplementation has an effect on most conditions, including chronic inflammation, despite use of increased doses of vitamin D, strengthening the hypothesis that low vitamin D status is a consequence of ill health, rather than its cause. We further hypothesise that vitamin D supplementation could exert immunomodulatory effects that strengthen resistance to acute infections, which would reduce the risk of death in debilitated individuals. We identified many meta-analyses of suboptimal quality, which is of concern. Future systematic reviews on vitamin D should be based on data sharing so that data for participants with the same outcomes measured in the same way can be pooled to generate stronger evidence.",Autier P; Mullie P; Macacu A; Dragomir M; Boniol M; Coppens K; Pizot C; Boniol M,The lancet.

29087242,Whey Protein Supplementation Improves Body Composition and Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Overweight and Obese Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Previous literature shows possible benefits of whey protein supplementation in promoting weight loss. However, most studies do not have enough power to show beneficial effects on body composition and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. This meta-analysis evaluated effects of whey protein in individuals who are overweight and obese. We comprehensively searched the databases of MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases. The inclusion criteria were published randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing whey protein supplementation to placebo or controls in individuals who are overweight or obese. The primary outcome was the differences in the change in body composition (body weight, waist circumference, total fat mass, body lean mass). We also examined the changes in CVD risk factors as secondary outcomes. We calculated pooled mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random effects model. Nine RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. There was a significant reduction of body weight (MD = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.30-0.81), lean mass (MD = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.59-0.96), and fat mass (MD = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.77-1.47) favoring the whey protein group. There were improvements in multiple CVD risk factors including levels of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, glucose, high-density lipoprotein, and total cholesterol (all p values <0.05). Whey protein supplementation seems to improve body weight, total fat mass, and some CVD risk factors in overweight and obese patients. Further studies regarding optimal dosage and duration of whey protein supplementation would be helpful to assess potential favorable effects in individuals who are overweight or obese.",Wirunsawanya K; Upala S; Jaruvongvanich V; Sanguankeo A,Journal of the American College of Nutrition,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29087242/,0,1,0,1,0,0

They comprise several antioxidant compounds and they are generally considered to be involved in the defense against human chronic diseases. During the last years, there has been growing scientific interest in their potential health benefits. In this comprehensive review, we focus on the current evidence defining the position of their dietary intake in the prevention/treatment of human chronic diseases, including prostate cancer and other types of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease; we also discuss their ability to modulate multiple signalling transduction pathways involved in the pathophysiology of these diseases. Despite the fact that data regarding the biological functions of polyphenols can be considered exhaustive, evidence is still inadequate to support clear beneficial effects on human chronic diseases. Currently, most data suggest that a combination of phytochemicals rather than any single polyphenol is responsible for health benefit. More studies investigating the role of polyphenols in the prevention of chronic human diseases are needed, especially for evaluating factors such as gender, age, genotype, metabolism and bioavailability.",Costa C; Tsatsakis A; Mamoulakis C; Teodoro M; Briguglio G; Caruso E; Tsoukalas D; Margina D; Dardiotis E; Kouretas D; Fenga C,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29042289/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Chemically synthesized drugs used to decrease the ill effects of DM and its secondary complications cause adverse side effects, viz., weight gain, gastrointestinal disturbances, and heart failure. Currently, various other approaches, viz., diet control, physical exercise and use of antidiabetic plant-derived molecules/foods are advocated to manage DM, as they are economical with fewer or no side effects. This review mainly focuses on antidiabetic plants, chemically characterized plant molecules and plant-based foods in the treatment of DM. Very little science-based evidence is available on the mechanism of action of plant-derived food molecules on the DM targets. Critical DM targets include α-amylase, α-glucosidase, DPP-IV, aldose reductase, PPAR-γ, AMP kinase and GLUT4. In-depth studies carried out on a few of those targets with specific mechanisms of action are addressed in this review.

28957454,The Effect of Improved Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Status on Glycemic Control in Diabetic Patients: A Meta-Analysis.,"Type 2 diabetes is a global health concern, with an increased prevalence and high cost of treatment. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation and improved vitamin D status on glycemia and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic patients. We searched PUBMED/Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, and Cochrane Library (until January 2017). Prospective clinical trials were selected evaluating the impact of vitamin D supplementation on glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), serum fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in diabetic patients. We used a random-effects model to synthesize quantitative data, followed by a leave-one-out method for sensitivity analysis. The systematic review registration was CRD42017059555. From a total of 844 entries identified via literature search, 24 controlled trials (1528 individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes) were included. The meta-analysis indicated a significant reduction in HbA1c [mean difference: -0.30%; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.45 to -0.15, P < 0.001], FPG [mean difference: -4.9 mg/dL (-0.27 mmol/L); 95% CI: -8.1 to -1.6 (-0.45 to -0.09 mmol/L), P = 0.003], and HOMA-IR (mean difference: -0.66; 95% CI: -1.06 to -0.26, P = 0.001) following vitamin D supplementation and significant increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels [overall increase of 17 ± 2.4 ng/mL (42 ± 6 nmol/L)].

The present meta-analysis aimed to quantitatively evaluate the effects of resveratrol intervention on risk factors of NCDs. PubMed and Scopus databases were searched up to June 2017. Weighted mean differences were calculated for net changes in risk factors of NCDs by using a random-effects model. Pre-specified subgroup and univariate meta-regression analyses were carried out to explore the sources of heterogeneity. Twenty-nine studies (30 treatment arms) with 1069 participants were identified. Resveratrol supplementation significantly reduced the concentrations of fasting glucose (-4.77 mg/dL; 95% CI: -9.33 to -0.21 mg/dL; P = 0.040), total cholesterol (TC) (-9.75 mg/dL; 95% CI: -17.04 to -2.46 mg/dL; P = 0.009), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (-0.81 mg/L; 95% CI: -1.42 to -0.21 mg/L; P = 0.009). Resveratrol intervention exerted significant reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Subgroup analysis also showed that the trials with resveratrol intervention ≥3 months significantly reduced the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), DBP, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values. The results did not support that resveratrol intervention had favorable effects in altering high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyceride (TAG), and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).

28845600,Implications of impaired zinc homeostasis in diabetic cardiomyopathy and nephropathy.,"Impaired zinc homeostasis is observed in diabetes mellitus (DM2) and its complications. Zinc has a specific role in pancreatic β-cells via insulin synthesis, storage, and secretion. Intracellular zinc homeostasis is tightly controlled by zinc transporters (ZnT and Zip families) and metallothioneins (MT) which modulate the uptake, storage, and distribution of zinc. Several investigations in animal models demonstrate the protective role of MT in DM2 and its cardiovascular or renal complications, while a copious literature shows that a common polymorphism (R325W) in ZnT8, which affects the protein's zinc transport activity, is associated with increased DM2 risk. Emerging studies highlight a role of other zinc transporters in β-cell function, suggesting that targeting them could make a possible contribution in managing the hyperglycemia in diabetic patients.

Findings from recent cohort studies, small randomized control trials, and multiple meta-analyses reinforce earlier work that serum Mg concentrations, urinary Mg excretion, and Mg dietary intakes are inversely associated with cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes. These studies indicate that the reference range for serum Mg needs updating, and that individuals with serum Mg in the range of 0.75-0.85 mmol/l and displaying changes in other factors associated with a low Mg status may be Mg deficient. Individuals with serum Mg concentrations below this range most likely are Mg deficient and, above this range, are most likely Mg sufficient. The combined determination of serum Mg concentration, 24-h urinary Mg excretion, and dietary Mg intake is currently the most practical method to obtain a sound assessment of Mg status. The strong correlations of Mg deficiency with increased risk of several chronic diseases, some of which exist as comorbidities, indicate that Mg status should be ascertained in patients presenting such disorder.",Costello RB; Nielsen F,Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28806179/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28791955,Determination of antioxidantactivity of phytochemicals in cellular models by fluorescence/luminescence methods.,"As soon as the role of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in so-called civilization diseases, which include non-infectious chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes or high blood pressure has been discovered, and the possibility of employing antioxidants as a remedy for these diseases have been proposed, scientists developed a broad spectrum of methods to determine antioxidant activity of pure chemicals and plant extracts, as well as dietary supplements. Most of these methods are based on simple redox reactions between antioxidant and ROS (for example ABTS, DPPH, or FRAP tests). However, chemical methods of assessing antioxidant activity are rarely biologically relevant. They do not mirror the real effect of antioxidants in living organisms, because they are used in non-physiological conditions of temperature and pH; neither they take metabolism nor intracellular transport under consideration. The perfect model for assessment of antioxidant activity in living organisms would be human or animal model, but such determinations are very complicated and often ambiguous. The current best alternative to chemical and human tests are assays employing cell culture models being less expensive than human tests, yet still reflecting biological systems more convincingly than chemical assays. Cellular antioxidant assays are performed under physiological pH and temperature, but most importantly, they take metabolism and intracellular transport under consideration. In this review, we present cellular tests used to determine antioxidant activity that are based on luminescence and fluorescence methods.",Koss-Mikołajczyk I; Baranowska M; Namieśnik J; Bartoszek A,Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28791955/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28768837,Vitamin D in the Spectrum of Prediabetes and Cardiovascular Autonomic Dysfunction.,"Vitamin D is a fat-soluble secosteroid hormone with pleiotropic effects. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D coordinates the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system, which regulate cardiovascular autonomic function and may explain its putative role in the development of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN). CAN is an independent risk factor for mortality in patients with diabetes and prediabetes and is associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Accumulating data indicate the presence of peripheral nerve injury at these early stages of dysglycemia and its multifactorial pathogenesis. Prediabetes is associated with vitamin D insufficiency. Vitamin D is proposed to prevent the progression of glucose intolerance. The putative underlying mechanisms include maintenance of the intracellular calcium concentration, direct stimulation of insulin receptor expression, and enhancement of the insulin response to glucose transporters. Vitamin D exerts a protective effect on peripheral nerve fibers by decreasing the demyelination process and inducing axonal regeneration. The effects of vitamin D supplementation on glucose tolerance and related autonomic nerve dysfunction have been a recent focus of scientific interest. Although well-designed observational studies are available, the causative relation between vitamin D deficiency, glucose intolerance, and CAN is still debatable. One reason might be that interventional studies are unpersuasive with regard to the beneficial clinical effects of vitamin D supplementation. Because of its favorable side effect profile, vitamin D supplementation might represent an attractive therapeutic option for treating the pandemic prevalence of prediabetes and vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D supplementation can improve glucose tolerance and cardiovascular autonomic function and can thus reduce cardiovascular mortality among subjects with different stages of glucose intolerance and autonomic dysfunction.

28759943,The Effects of Vitamin D Supplementation on Glucose Metabolism and Lipid Profiles in Patients with Gestational Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to summarize the effect of vitamin D supplementation on glucose homeostasis parameters and lipid profiles in gestational diabetes (GDM) patients. We conducted an electronic systematic search of MEDLINE, and 4 other research databases from inception to August 2016, in addition to performing hand searches and consulting with experts in the field. The index of heterogeneity between studies was determined using Cochran (Q) and I-squared tests. Given the existing heterogeneity between studies, a fix or random effect model was performed to estimate the standardized mean difference (SMD) for each variable by using inverse variance method and Cohen statistics. Six randomized clinical trials (187 subjects and 184 controls) were included. The results showed that vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) [SMD -0.66; 95% confidence interval (CI), -1.14 to -0.18], homeostatic model assessment-B cell function (HOMA-B) (SMD -0.52; 95% CI, -0.79 to -0.25), LDL-cholesterol levels (SMD -0.33; 95% CI, -0.58 to -0.07), and significantly increased quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) (SMD 0.73; 95% CI, 0.26 to 1.20). We found no beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation on fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin, HbA1c, total-, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides concentrations. In conclusion, this meta-analysis demonstrated that vitamin D supplementation may lead to an improvement in HOMA-IR, QUICKI, and LDL-cholesterol levels, but did not affect FPG, insulin, HbA1c, triglycerides, total- and HDL-cholesterol levels; however, vitamin D supplementation increased HOMA-B.",Akbari M; Moosazaheh M; Lankarani KB; Tabrizi R; Samimi M; Karamali M; Jamilian M; Kolahdooz F; Asemi Z,Hormone and metabolic research = Hormon- und Stoffwechselforschung = Hormones et metabolisme,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28759943/,0,1,0,1,0,0
28753984,Dietary Modulation of Oxidative Stress in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Cells generate unpaired electrons, typically via oxygen- or nitrogen-based by-products during normal cellular respiration and under stressed situations. These pro-oxidant molecules are highly unstable and may oxidize surrounding cellular macromolecules. Under normal conditions, the reactive oxygen or nitrogen species can be beneficial to cell survival and function by destroying and degrading pathogens or antigens. However, excessive generation and accumulation of the reactive pro-oxidant species over time can damage proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. Over time, this oxidative stress can contribute to a range of aging-related degenerative diseases such as cancer, diabetes, macular degeneration, and Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases. It is well accepted that natural compounds, including vitamins A, C, and E, β-carotene, and minerals found in fruits and vegetables are powerful anti-oxidants that offer health benefits against several different oxidative stress induced degenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is increasing interest in developing anti-oxidative therapeutics to prevent AD. There are contradictory and inconsistent reports on the possible benefits of anti-oxidative supplements; however, fruits and vegetables enriched with multiple anti-oxidants (e.g., flavonoids and polyphenols) and minerals may be highly effective in attenuating the harmful effects of oxidative stress. As the physiological activation of either protective or destructive pro-oxidant behavior remains relatively unclear, it is not straightforward to relate the efficacy of dietary anti-oxidants in disease prevention. Here, we review oxidative stress mediated toxicity associated with AD and highlight the modulatory roles of natural dietary anti-oxidants in preventing AD.",Thapa A; Carroll NJ,International journal of molecular sciences,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28753984/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE and five other databases to identify all RCTs investigating the association between vitamin D and NAFLD up until 5 October 2016. Seven RCTs with 452 participants (227 patients and 225 controls) were included in the meta-analysis. The results showed that vitamin D administration had no beneficial effect on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (standardized mean difference [SMD]-0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.88, 0.42), insulin (SMD -1.09; 95% CI, -2.70,0.52) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (SMD -1.89; 95% CI, -3.88,0.09).

28718091,Nutritional and Micronutrient Care of Bariatric Surgery Patients: Current Evidence Update.,"The continued success of bariatric surgery to treat obesity and obesity-associated metabolic conditions creates a need for a strong understanding of clinical nutrition both before and after these procedures. Surgically induced alteration of gastrointestinal physiology can affect the nutrition of individuals, especially among those who have undergone malabsorptive procedures. While uncommon, a subset of patients may develop protein-calorie malnutrition. In these cases, nutrition support should be tailored to the severity of malnutrition. Among all patients who undergo bariatric surgery, high rates of micronutrient deficiencies have been observed. To mitigate these deficiencies, empiric supplementation with multivitamins, calcium citrate, and vitamin D is generally recommended. Periodic surveillance should be performed for commonly deficient micronutrients, including thiamin (B1), folate (B9), cobalamin (B12), iron, and vitamin D. Following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, serum levels of copper and zinc should also be monitored. In addition, lipid-soluble vitamins should be monitored following biliopancreatic diversion with/without duodenal switch.",Via MA; Mechanick JI,Current obesity reports,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28718091/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We performed a systematic quantitative review on characteristics of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) included in meta-analyses (MAs) on non-skeletal effects of vitamin D supplementation. We identified systematic reviews (SR) reporting summary data in terms of MAs of RCTs on selected non-skeletal outcomes. For each outcome, we summarized the results from available SRs and scrutinized included RCTs for a number of predefined characteristics. We identified 54 SRs including data from 210 RCTs. Most MAs as well as the individual RCTs reported null-findings on risk of cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, weight-loss, and malignant diseases. Beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation was reported in 1 of 4 MAs on depression, 2 of 9 MAs on blood pressure, 3 of 7 MAs on respiratory tract infections, and 8 of 12 MAs on mortality. Most RCTs have primarily been performed to determine skeletal outcomes, whereas non-skeletal effects have been assessed as secondary outcomes. Only one-third of the RCTs had low level of 25OHD as a criterion for inclusion and a mean baseline 25OHD level below 50 nmol/L was only present in less than half of the analyses.

Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D l <20 ng/ml are diagnostic of vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D has various cardiovascular pleiotropic effects by activating its nuclear receptor in cardiomyocytes and vascular endothelial cells and by regulating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, adiposity, energy expenditure, and pancreatic cell activity. In humans, vitamin D deficiency is associated with the following: vascular dysfunction; arterial stiffening; left ventricular hypertrophy; and worsened metrics of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. It is also linked with worse cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, meta-analyses of vitamin D supplementation trials have failed to show clear improvements in blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, or lipid parameters, thus suggesting that the link between vitamin D deficiency and cardiovascular disease may be an epiphenomenon.

28639965,Is selenium supplementation in autoimmune thyroid diseases justified?,"This review provides an appraisal of recent evidence for or against selenium supplementation in patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases, and discusses possible effect mechanisms. Epidemiological data suggest an increased prevalence of autoimmune thyroid diseases under conditions of low dietary selenium intake. Two systematic reviews have evaluated controlled trials among patients with autoimmune thyroiditis and report that selenium supplementation decreases circulating thyroid autoantibodies. The immunomodulatory effects of selenium might involve reducing proinflammatory cytokine release. However, clinically relevant effects of selenium supplementation, including improvement in quality of life, are more elusive. In Graves' disease, some, but not all, trials indicate that adjuvant selenium supplementation enhances the restoration of biochemical euthyroidism, and might benefit patients with mild Graves' orbitopathy. The use of selenium supplementation as adjuvant therapy to standard thyroid medication may be widespread, but a growing body of evidence yields equivocal results. The available evidence from trials does not support routine selenium supplementation in the standard treatment of patients with autoimmune thyroiditis or Graves' disease. However, correction of moderate to severe selenium deficiency may offer benefits in preventing, as well as treating, these disorders.

One antioxidant supplement is Alpha-lipoic acid. However, recommending ALA as an anti-obesity supplement remains controversial. Accordingly, the purpose of the present study was to perform a meta-analysis on the effects of ALA supplement on anthropometric indices among adult subjects. We searched five electronic databases till September 2016. Placebo-controlled clinical trials were included. Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) was pooled using a random-effects model. Findings of 12 included trials indicated that ALA supplement reduced body weight (WMD: -0.69 kg; 95% CI: -1.27, -0.10; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%) and BMI (WMD: -0.38 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; 95% CI: -0.53, -0.24; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%) significantly compared to the placebo group.

28624654,Insulin signaling: An opportunistic target to minify the risk of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by accumulation of senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and neurodegeneration. The diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the risk factors for AD pathogenesis by impairment in insulin signaling and glucose metabolism in central as well as peripheral system. Insulin resistance, impaired glucose and lipid metabolism are leading to the Aβ (Aβ) aggregation, Tau phosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, protein misfolding, memory impairment and also mark over Aβ transport through central to peripheral and vice versa. Several pathways, like enzymatic degradation of Aβ, forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO) signaling, insulin signaling shared common pathological mechanism for both AD and DM. Recent evidence showed that hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia affect the onset and progression of AD differently. Some researchers have suggested that hyperglycemia influences vascular tone, while hyperinsulinemia may underlie mitochondrial deficit. The objective of this review is to determine whether existing evidence supports the concept that impairment in insulin signaling and glucose metabolism play an important role in pathogenesis of AD. In the first part of this review, we tried to explain the interconnecting link between AD and DM, whereas the second part includes more information on insulin resistance and its involvement in AD pathogenesis. In the final part of this review, we have focused more toward the AD treatment by targeting insulin signaling like anti-diabetic, antioxidant, nutraceuticals and dietary supplements. To date, more researches should be done in this field in order to explore the pathways in insulin signaling, which might ameliorate the treatment options and reduce the risk of AD due to DM.",Pardeshi R; Bolshette N; Gadhave K; Ahire A; Ahmed S; Cassano T; Gupta VB; Lahkar M,Psychoneuroendocrinology,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28624654/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28615996,"International Society of Sports Nutrition position stand: safety and efficacy of creatine supplementation in exercise, sport, and medicine.","Creatine is one of the most popular nutritional ergogenic aids for athletes. Studies have consistently shown that creatine supplementation increases intramuscular creatine concentrations which may help explain the observed improvements in high intensity exercise performance leading to greater training adaptations. In addition to athletic and exercise improvement, research has shown that creatine supplementation may enhance post-exercise recovery, injury prevention, thermoregulation, rehabilitation, and concussion and/or spinal cord neuroprotection. Additionally, a number of clinical applications of creatine supplementation have been studied involving neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., muscular dystrophy, Parkinson's, Huntington's disease), diabetes, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, aging, brain and heart ischemia, adolescent depression, and pregnancy. These studies provide a large body of evidence that creatine can not only improve exercise performance, but can play a role in preventing and/or reducing the severity of injury, enhancing rehabilitation from injuries, and helping athletes tolerate heavy training loads. Additionally, researchers have identified a number of potentially beneficial clinical uses of creatine supplementation. These studies show that short and long-term supplementation (up to 30 g/day for 5 years) is safe and well-tolerated in healthy individuals and in a number of patient populations ranging from infants to the elderly. Moreover, significant health benefits may be provided by ensuring habitual low dietary creatine ingestion (e.g., 3 g/day) throughout the lifespan.

Intervention and observational studies were carried out in both, healthy subjects and patients and describe the association of foodstuffs as well as isolated nutrients with biomarkers of oxidative stress. The results from human intervention studies on healthy participants and patients are controversial. Long-term interventions (>8 weeks) seem to be more effective than short-term or single-dose interventions. Results are difficult to compare because not only the methods used, also the assessed biomarkers and outcomes were very diverse. In addition, studies vary in the compounds and doses used, duration, participants and so on. Different biomarkers (damaged molecules together with antioxidants from different compartments) should be assessed to evaluate the true 'redox-status' of an individual and the impact of a nutritional intervention. Both observational and interventional studies performed in healthy participants and patients show possible beneficial effects of nutrients and foodstuffs by improving oxidative stress markers and antioxidant enzyme activities.

Hence, we performed a meta-analysis to determine the effect of low AGE diets in reducing cardiometabolic risk factors. Seventeen randomised controlled trials comprising 560 participants were included. Meta-analyses using random effects models were used to analyse the data. Low AGE diets decreased insulin resistance (mean difference [MD] -1.3, 95% CI -2.3, -0.2), total cholesterol (MD -8.5 mg/dl, 95% CI -9.5, -7.4) and low-density lipoprotein (MD -2.4 mg/dl, 95% CI -3.4, -1.3). There were no changes in weight, fasting glucose, 2-h glucose and insulin, haemoglobin A1c, high-density lipoprotein or blood pressure. In a subgroup of patients with type 2 diabetes, a decrease in fasting insulin (MD -7 µU/ml, 95% CI -11.5, -2.5) was observed. Tumour necrosis factor α, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, 8-isoprostane, leptin, circulating AGEs and receptor for AGEs were reduced after consumption of low AGE diets with increased adiponectin and sirtuin-1.

28530530,Is Fish Oil a Potential Treatment for Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy?,"Peripheral neuropathy affects about 50% of the diabetic population. The manifestations range from pain, numbness, paresthesia and ulceration in the extremities and it is the major cause of non-traumatic amputations. Currently there is no effective treatment for peripheral neuropathy. With the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes and associated complications reaching epidemic levels, there is a critical need for finding a treatment to preserve nerve function. This article will review the potential for fish oil as a treatment for diabetic peripheral neuropathy. A through search of the PubMed database was performed and relevant articles on the topic were included in this review. Many studies support a role for fish oil in cardiovascular health. However, less information is available regarding the effect of fish oil on diabetes complications including neuropathy. Pre-clinical studies from my laboratory using diabetic rodent models have demonstrated that fish oil can slow progression and reverse diabetic neuropathy as determined by examining multiple endpoints. Mechanistically fish oil has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties. Lowering the omega-6/omega-3 fatty acid ratio has been shown to be anti-thrombotic. Moreover, metabolites of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids, the main polyunsaturated fatty acids found in fish oil, commonly referred to as resolvins and neuroprotectin have been shown to be neuroprotective and can stimulate neuron outgrowth in vitro. Additional studies are required but existing data suggests that dietary enrichment with omega-3 fatty acids contained in fish oil may be beneficial treatment for diabetic neuropathy.",Yorek MA,Current diabetes reviews,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28530530/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28529919,The role of nutraceuticals in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) ranks among the most common health-related and economic issues worldwide. Dietary factors are important contributors to cardiovascular risk, either directly, or through their effects on other cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus. Nutraceuticals are natural nutritional compounds, which have been shown to be efficacious in preventative medicine or in the treatment of disease. Several foods and dietary supplements have been shown to protect against the development of CVD. The aim of this review is to present an update on the most recent evidence relating to the use of nutraceuticals in the context of the prevention and treatment of CVD.",Sosnowska B; Penson P; Banach M,Cardiovascular diagnosis and therapy,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28529919/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28508737,The future for long chain n-3 PUFA in the prevention of coronary heart disease: do we need to target non-fish-eaters?,"Dietary guidelines in many countries include a recommendation to consume oily fish, mainly on the basis of evidence from prospective cohort studies that fish consumption is cardioprotective. However, average intakes are very low in a large proportion of the UK population. Some groups, such as vegans and vegetarians, purposely omit fish (along with meat) from their diet resulting in zero or trace intakes of long chain (LC) n-3 PUFA. Although the efficacy of dietary fish oil supplementation in the prevention of CVD has been questioned in recent years, the balance of evidence indicates that LC n-3 PUFA exert systemic pleiotropic effects through their influence on gene expression, cell signalling, membrane fluidity and by conversion to specialised proresolving mediators; autacoid lipid mediators that resolve inflammatory events. The long-term impact of reduced tissue LC n-3 PUFA content on cardiovascular health is surprisingly poorly understood, particularly with regard to how low proportions of LC n-3 PUFA in cell membranes may affect cardiac electrophysiology and chronic inflammation. Randomised controlled trials investigating effects of supplementation on prevention of CHD in populations with low basal LC n-3 PUFA tissue status are lacking, and so the clinical benefits of supplementing non-fish-eating groups with vegetarian sources of LC n-3 PUFA remain to be determined. Refocusing dietary LC n-3 PUFA intervention studies towards those individuals with a low LC n-3 PUFA tissue status may go some way towards reconciling results from randomised controlled trials with the epidemiological evidence.",Hall WL,The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28508737/,1,0,0,0,0,1
28507012,Dietary Factors Promoting Brown and Beige Fat Development and Thermogenesis.,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a specialized fat tissue that has a high capacity to dissociate cellular respiration from ATP utilization, resulting in the release of stored energy as heat. Adult humans possess a substantial amount of BAT in the form of constitutively active brown fat or inducible beige fat. BAT activity in humans is inversely correlated with adiposity, blood glucose concentrations, and insulin sensitivity; this suggests that strategies aimed at BAT-mediated bioenergetics are an attractive therapeutic target in combating the continuing epidemic of obesity and diabetes. Despite advances in knowledge regarding the developmental lineage and transcriptional regulators of brown and beige adipocytes, our current understanding of environmental modifiers of BAT thermogenesis, such as diet, is limited. In this review, we consolidated the latest research on dietary molecules that may serve to promote BAT thermogenesis. Here, we summarized the thermogenic function of selected phytochemicals (e.g., capsaicin, resveratrol, curcumin, green tea, and berberine), dietary fatty acids (e.g., fish oil and conjugated linoleic acids), and all-<i>trans</i> retinoic acid, a vitamin A metabolite. We also delineated the proposed mechanisms whereby these dietary molecules promote BAT activity and/or browning of white adipose tissue. Characterizing thermogenic dietary factors may offer novel insight into revising nutritional intervention strategies aimed at obesity and diabetes prevention and management.",Okla M; Kim J; Koehler K; Chung S,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28507012/,1,0,0,0,0,0

A large body of evidence suggests that vitamin D might have beneficial effects on metabolic/hormonal parameters of PCOS and endometriosis, while it appears to be associated with IVF outcomes. However, due to the heterogeneity among observational and interventional studies, no cause-effect relationship has yet been established. The aim of this review is to analyze recent in vitro animal and human studies which examined the association of vitamin D with disease entities affecting female fertility potential. Recent research data strongly imply that vitamin D is implicated in female reproduction and might represent a beneficial and inexpensive therapeutic approach, in combination with first-line medical treatments, to female infertility.",Voulgaris N; Papanastasiou L; Piaditis G; Angelousi A; Kaltsas G; Mastorakos G; Kassi E,"Hormones (Athens, Greece)",2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28500824/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28483335,The effect of vitamin D supplementation on glucose metabolism in type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis of intervention studies.,"We aimed to assess whether vitamin D supplementation improves glucose metabolism in adults with type 2 diabetes. PubMed and Cochrane database were searched up to July 1st 2016 for randomized controlled trials that assessed the relationship between vitamin D supplementation and glucose metabolism (change in hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) and fasting blood glucose (FBG)) among adults with type 2 diabetes. Twenty nine trials (3324 participants) were included in the systematic review. Among 22 studies included in the meta-analysis, 19 reported HbA1C, 16 reported FBG outcomes and 15 were deemed poor quality. There was a modest reduction in HbA1C (-0.32% [-0.53 to -0.10], I<sup>2</sup>=91.9%) compared to placebo after vitamin D supplementation but no effect on FBG (-2.33mg/dl [-6.62 to 1.95], I<sup>2</sup>=59.2%). In studies achieving repletion of vitamin D deficiency (n=7), there were greater mean reductions in HbA1C (-0.45%, [-1.09 to 0.20]) and FBG (-7.64mg/dl [-16.25 to 0.97]) although not significant. We found a modest reduction of HbA1C after vitamin D treatment in adults with type 2 diabetes albeit with substantial heterogeneity between studies and no difference in FBG.

It occurs at all stages of the life cycle, but is more prevalent in pregnant women and young children. IDA appears to be more common in diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic population. Iron deficiency (ID) and IDA can impair glucose homeostasis in animals and human and may negatively affect glycemic control and predispose to more complications in diabetic patients. On the other hand diabetes and its complications are associated with anemia and its correction improves diabetes control and may prevent or delay the occurrence of complications. Physicians treating this form of anemia should be aware of its negative effect on glycemic control in normal and diabetic patients (both type 1 and type 2). They should prevent ID and treat early all those with IDA.This brief review aims to enlighten the different effects of IDA on glucose metabolism in normal and diabetic patients.",Soliman AT; De Sanctis V; Yassin M; Soliman N,Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28467345/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28451949,Interaction Between the Haptoglobin Genotype and Vitamin E on Cardiovascular Disease in Diabetes.,"Despite compelling evidence regarding the importance of oxidant stress in the development of vascular complications and observational studies suggesting that vitamin E may be protective from these complications, multiple clinical trials have failed to show benefit from vitamin E supplementation in the prevention of vascular complications in diabetes. One possible explanation for this failure of vitamin E may have been inappropriate patient selection. This review seeks to provide the clinical evidence and mechanistic basis for why a subset of individuals defined by their haptoglobin (Hp) genotype may derive cardiovascular protection by vitamin E supplementation. Clinical trial data from the HOPE, ICARE, and WHS studies is presented showing a pharmacogenomic interaction between the Hp genotype and vitamin E on the development of CVD. Specifically, in individuals with diabetes and the Hp2-2 genotype, vitamin E has been shown to be associated with an approximately 35% reduction in CVD. Cardioprotection by vitamin E in individuals with the Hp2-2 genotype appears to be mediated in part by an improvement in HDL functionality as demonstrated in three independent trials in both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Vitamin E may provide benefit in reducing CVD in Hp2-2 individuals with diabetes. However, in order for this pharmacogenomic algorithm to be accepted as a standard of care and used clinically, an additional large prospective study will need to be performed.",Hochberg I; Berinstein EM; Milman U; Shapira C; Levy AP,Current diabetes reports,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28451949/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Potential epidemiological alert in America?","Vitamin D deficiency is a serious public health problem worldwide that affects not only skeletal health, but also a wide range of acute and chronic diseases. However, there is still skepticism because of the lack of randomized, controlled trials to support association studies on the benefits of vitamin D for non-skeletal health. This review was based on articles published during the 1980-2015 obtained from the Cochrane Central Register of controlled trials, MEDLINE and PubMed, and focuses on recent challenges with regard to the definition of vitamin D deficiency and how to achieve optimal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels from dietary sources, supplements, and sun exposure. The effect of vitamin D on epigenetic fetal programming and regulation of genes that may potentially explain why vitamin D could have such lifelong comprehensive health benefits is reviewed. Optimization of vitamin D levels in children and adults around the world has potential benefits to improve skeletal health and to reduce the risk of chronic diseases, including some types of cancer, autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and severe cardiovascular disorders such as atherothrombosis, neurocognitive disorders, and mortality.",Rosas-Peralta M; Holick MF; Borrayo-Sánchez G; Madrid-Miller A; Ramírez-Árias E; Arizmendi-Uribe E,"Endocrinologia, diabetes y nutricion",2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28440755/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28436101,Systematic review on evidence-based adolescent nutrition interventions.,"Adolescence is a critical stage in the life cycle, and adequate nutrition is necessary for the proper growth and development of individuals and their offspring. Here, we comprehensively review all published systematic reviews (through October 2016) on adolescents (10-19 years) and women of reproductive age, including pregnant women, which targeted interventions related to nutrition. For interventions where there was no existing systematic review on adolescents, we reviewed primary studies/trials. We included interventions on micronutrient supplementation (iron, folic acid, iron-folic acid (IFA), calcium, vitamin D, vitamin A, zinc, iodine, and multiple micronutrients), food/protein energy supplementation, nutrition education for pregnant adolescents, obesity prevention and management, and management of gestational diabetes. We identified a total of 35 systematic reviews, of which only five were conducted on adolescents, and 107 primary studies on adolescents. Our review suggests that iron alone, IFA, zinc, and multiple micronutrient supplementation in adolescents can significantly improve serum hemoglobin concentration. While zinc supplementation in pregnant adolescents showed improvements in preterm birth and low birth weight, we found a paucity of trials on calcium, vitamin D, vitamin A, and iodine supplementation. We found limited evidence on food/protein energy supplementation in adolescents. Interventions to prevent and manage obesity showed a nonsignificant impact on reducing body mass index. This review underscores the importance of adolescent nutrition interventions. It is imperative that countries design nutritional interventions, particularly for adolescents.",Lassi ZS; Moin A; Das JK; Salam RA; Bhutta ZA,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28436101/,0,1,0,1,0,0
28434481,"Is there a role for lifestyle changes in cardiovascular prevention? What, when and how?","Lifestyle has been found to play an important role in the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). There is evidence to suggest that if lifestyle factors are modified successfully, the relative risk of CVD can be reduced. Risk factors for CVD such as high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidaemias can be modified by lifestyle changes. The main aim of this article is to provide best practice approaches and support for healthcare professionals on the role of lifestyle changes in the prevention of CVD. A working group of experts discussed existing guidelines, clinical practice and evidence, and provided their recommendations on ten topics concerning the role of lifestyle in CVD prevention. These topics covered important lifestyle factors as well as tools/approaches to assess or encourage lifestyle changes. The group of clinical experts collaborated to provide their opinion on the following topics: one diet versus customised diets; the role of alcohol consumption in a healthy diet; a diet based on nutrient composition or on whole foods; a Mediterranean versus low-fat diet; the role of dietary supplements; physical activity; smoking cessation; the role of a nutritionist/dietitian in a CVD risk multidisciplinary team; tools to be implemented to assess diet, physical activity and smoking status; and the most effective approaches to encourage lifestyle changes.

28425110,Neural tube defects: Risk factors and preventive measures.,"For the last 25 years, it has been proven that the occurrence or recurrence of neural tube defects can be prevented with the administration of folic acid before and early pregnancy. At present, over 80 countries in the world, except Japan, have mandated the fortification of wheat flour and/or rice with folic acid, which has resulted in a significant reduction in the prevalence of neural tube defects. In 2000, the Japanese government recommended folic acid 400 μg daily for young women of childbearing age and women who are planning to conceive. In 2002, the government started to present information about the importance of folic acid in the development of fetuses in the Mother-Child Health Booklet annually. Despite these endeavors, the prevalence of neural tube defects has remained unchanged. We discuss the risk factors of neural tube defects and propose preventive measures to decrease the number of neonates with neural tube defects. We believe that the government should implement the fortification of staple food with folic acid very soon, which will eventually decrease not only the neonatal mortality and morbidity, but also the economic burden on our health care system.",Kondo A; Matsuo T; Morota N; Kondo AS; Okai I; Fukuda H,Congenital anomalies,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28425110/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28420574,Vitamin supplements in type 2 diabetes mellitus management: A review.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major public health challenge that affects countries across the world. The use of pharmacological therapy is often limited in some patients due to a loss of effect over time or development of adverse effects such as weight gain or hypoglycaemia. This has prompted searches into the role of non-pharmacological therapies in T2DM. The availability and use of vitamin supplements in developed countries have increased significantly and there is evidence that certain vitamins may have roles in the management of T2DM. This review examines the literature assessing the use of vitamins A, C, E, D, K and the B group vitamins (B1, B3, B7, B6, B9, B12) in the management of T2DM. No clear evidence supporting the beneficial role of any specific vitamin in the treatment of T2DM was found.

We provide suggested approaches to the dietary management of PBH, incorporating data from both the medical literature and extensive clinical experience in an academic referral center for PBH. The overall goal of medical nutrition therapy for PBH is to reduce postprandial surges in glucose, which often trigger surges in insulin secretion and promote subsequent hypoglycemia. Thus, strategies focus on controlled portions of low glycemic index carbohydrates, avoidance of rapidly-absorbed carbohydrates, adjustment of timing of meals and snacks, and attention to personal and cultural barriers to implementation.",Suhl E; Anderson-Haynes SE; Mulla C; Patti ME,Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28392017/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28390010,Vitamin D supplementation in the prevention and management of major chronic diseases not related to mineral homeostasis in adults: research for evidence and a scientific statement from the European society for clinical and economic aspects of osteoporosis and osteoarthritis (ESCEO).,"Optimal vitamin D status promotes skeletal health and is recommended with specific treatment in individuals at high risk for fragility fractures. A growing body of literature has provided indirect and some direct evidence for possible extraskeletal vitamin D-related effects. Members of the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis have reviewed the main evidence for possible proven benefits of vitamin D supplementation in adults at risk of or with overt chronic extra-skeletal diseases, providing recommendations and guidelines for future studies in this field. Robust mechanistic evidence is available from in vitro studies and in vivo animal studies, usually employing cholecalciferol, calcidiol or calcitriol in pharmacologic rather than physiologic doses. Although many cross-sectional and prospective association studies in humans have shown that low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (i.e., <50 nmol/L) are consistently associated with chronic diseases, further strengthened by a dose-response relationship, several meta-analyses of clinical trials have shown contradictory results. Overall, large randomized controlled trials with sufficient doses of vitamin D are missing, and available small to moderate-size trials often included people with baseline levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels >50 nmol/L, did not simultaneously assess multiple outcomes, and did not report overall safety (e.g., falls). Thus, no recommendations can be made to date for the use of vitamin D supplementation in general, parental compounds, or non-hypercalcemic vitamin D analogs in the prevention and treatment of extra-skeletal chronic diseases. Moreover, attainment of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels well above the threshold desired for bone health cannot be recommended based on current evidence, since safety has yet to be confirmed. Finally, the promising findings from mechanistic studies, large cohort studies, and small clinical trials obtained for autoimmune diseases (including type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus), cardiovascular disorders, and overall reduction in mortality require further confirmation.",Cianferotti L; Bertoldo F; Bischoff-Ferrari HA; Bruyere O; Cooper C; Cutolo M; Kanis JA; Kaufman JM; Reginster JY; Rizzoli R; Brandi ML,Endocrine,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28390010/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Systematic reviews provide ready-to-use syntheses of quality-appraised evidence to inform decision-making for actions. To enhance the utility and quality of future Cochrane nutrition evidence, we described the scope and quality of all nutrition systematic reviews in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR). We screened all active CDSR records (31 July 2015) to identify reviews and protocols using pre-specified eligibility criteria and definitions. Duplicate, independent data extraction included criteria for inclusion of studies in completed reviews (PICOS). We assessed methodological quality (AMSTAR), use of GRADE, mapped reviews against 2013 Global Burden of Disease data, and categorised the paradigm (medical, lifestyle and socio-ecological) of the review question. We analysed our results using descriptive statistics. We screened 8484 records, and included 470 (8%) completed reviews (in 45 Cochrane Review Groups (CRGs)) and 169 (7%) protocols (in 41 CRGs) published by 47 of 53 CRGs with reviews. Most completed reviews were produced by the Pregnancy and Childbirth (n = 73), Neonatal (n = 64), Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders (n = 33), Developmental, Psychosocial and Learning Problems (n = 26), Kidney and Transplant (n = 18) and Heart (n = 18) CRGs. Only 27% (n = 129) of reviews had searches for new studies in 2013 or thereafter. Supplementation/supplement interventions were most common (50%; n = 235; majority with micronutrients; 73%, n = 173), followed by food interventions (20%; n = 95). All reviews included randomised controlled trials; about 5% included other designs; 25% used GRADE; the median AMSTAR score ﻿was 9 (interquartile range: 7 t﻿o 10), 51% were high (AMSTAR 9-11) and 49% moderate (AMSTAR 5-8) quality. More than 80% framed questions using a medical paradigm. For top causes of years-of-life-lost, most reviews addressed preterm birth, diabetes and ischaemic heart disease; for leading risk factors for disability-adjusted-life-years, most targeted childhood undernutrition and high body mass index. Nutrition reviews comprised 8% of active CDSR records, were widely distributed across nearly all CRGs and reflected the double nutrition burden. This analysis presents a comprehensive description of the scope and quality of Cochrane nutrition reviews, and identifies gaps for future activities to support actions to address the nutrition burden, in line with the current nutrition agenda and impetus.",Naude CE; Durao S; Harper A; Volmink J,Nutrition journal,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28388919/,0,1,0,0,0,0
28376052,Which dietary components modulate longitudinal growth?,"Linear growth in children is sensitive to nutritional status; the growth of the human skeleton requires many different nutritional factors for energy and building blocks: proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and micronutrients. However, what are the specific nutritional factors that are required for proper growth and what is the composition that will be most beneficial is still not known. Recent findings indicate that macro and micronutrients are required as building blocks and as cofactors for important enzymes. In addition, they stimulate linear growth by acting as regulatory factors and also affect gut microbiome. Some interesting studies regarding the effect of proteins and amino acids are presented. Most studies investigated the effect of replacing a single micronutrient that was deficient; however, in real life, deficiency of one nutritional element is commonly associated with other deficiencies. Therefore, it is a reasonable clinical approach, both in developing and developed countries, to use a mixture of both macro and micronutrients to support growth.

28345527,Prevalence and factors promoting the occurrence of vitamin D deficiency in the elderly.,"Vitamin D deficiency affects a large part of the population of elderly people, especially women, who live in moderate climate countries due to a reduced amount of vitamin D in the diet (small sea fish consumption) and reduced content of 7-dehydrocholesterol, which causes decreased skin synthesis. The lowest seasonal concentration of 25(OH)D3 is usually observed during winter and spring. Sun exposure influences 25(OH)D3 concentration more strongly in men than in women. Sociodemographic factors that increase the risk of vitamin D deficiency in the elderly include poor environmental conditions, low economic status, lower educational level, drug exposure (smoking), reduced physical activity, overall poor health and obesity, which causes reduced skin exposure to sunlight. The use of medications or supplements that contain vitamin D and staying in a nursing home that employ such supplementation are factors that prevent deficiency. Significant prevalence of diseases of the gastrointestinal tract may contribute to cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol malabsorption or impair their liver transformation. In addition, the high incidence of chronic kidney disease in old age reduces processing hydroxylation of vitamin D and the formation of active metabolites. Vitamin D deficiency can not only cause bone mineralization disorders, but also increase incidence of cardiovascular diseases, cancers, type 2 diabetes and depression. The aim of this study was to summarize current knowledge about the risk factors of vitamin D deficiency development in the elderly population.",Wyskida M; Wieczorowska-Tobis K; Chudek J,Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28345527/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28341729,Vitamin D deficiency and diabetes.,"Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to the onset of diabetes. This review summarizes the role of Vitamin D in maintaining the normal release of insulin by the pancreatic beta cells (β-cells). Diabetes is initiated by the onset of insulin resistance. The β-cells can overcome this resistance by releasing more insulin, thus preventing hyperglycaemia. However, as this hyperactivity increases, the β-cells experience excessive Ca<sup>2+</sup> and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signalling that results in cell death and the onset of diabetes. Vitamin D deficiency contributes to both the initial insulin resistance and the subsequent onset of diabetes caused by β-cell death. Vitamin D acts to reduce inflammation, which is a major process in inducing insulin resistance. Vitamin D maintains the normal resting levels of both Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ROS that are elevated in the β-cells during diabetes. Vitamin D also has a very significant role in maintaining the epigenome. Epigenetic alterations are a feature of diabetes by which many diabetes-related genes are inactivated by hypermethylation. Vitamin D acts to prevent such hypermethylation by increasing the expression of the DNA demethylases that prevent hypermethylation of multiple gene promoter regions of many diabetes-related genes. What is remarkable is just how many cellular processes are maintained by Vitamin D. When Vitamin D is deficient, many of these processes begin to decline and this sets the stage for the onset of diseases such as diabetes.",Berridge MJ,The Biochemical journal,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28341729/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Generally, glycine is synthesized from choline, serine, hydroxyproline, and threonine through interorgan metabolism in which kidneys and liver are the primarily involved. Generally in common feeding conditions, glycine is not sufficiently synthesized in humans, animals, and birds. Glycine acts as precursor for several key metabolites of low molecular weight such as creatine, glutathione, haem, purines, and porphyrins. Glycine is very effective in improving the health and supports the growth and well-being of humans and animals. There are overwhelming reports supporting the role of supplementary glycine in prevention of many diseases and disorders including cancer. Dietary supplementation of proper dose of glycine is effectual in treating metabolic disorders in patients with cardiovascular diseases, several inflammatory diseases, obesity, cancers, and diabetes. Glycine also has the property to enhance the quality of sleep and neurological functions. In this review we will focus on the metabolism of glycine in humans and animals and the recent findings and advances about the beneficial effects and protection of glycine in different disease states.",Razak MA; Begum PS; Viswanath B; Rajagopal S,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28337245/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28334220,Effect of vitamin D deficiency in developed countries.,"Vitamin D deficiency is common worldwide with adverse effects on skeletal health. In recent years, there has been great interest in non-classical actions of vitamin D. Basic research has uncovered actions in a range of non-skeletal tissues, and observational studies have identified inverse relationships with risk of a number of disease states including sarcopenia, obesity, the metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, cancer and autoimmune diseases. PubMed, Medline and Cochrane Systematic Reviews. Current evidence supports the use of vitamin D supplementation in deficiency to improve skeletal outcomes such as falls/fracture risk and bone mineral density. There is debate reflected in guidelines on optimal thresholds for circulating levels of vitamin D. Further studies are required to refine dosing regimens and treatment target levels of vitamin D. A number of studies have investigated the extra-skeletal effects of vitamin D deficiency but causality in humans has yet to be confirmed. Large-scale randomized controlled trials incorporating data on vitamin D status at baseline and follow up, adverse events, and comparison of dosing regimens are required. It is imperative that studies are carried out with a diverse range of participants (age, gender and ethnicity), and settings to allow for a more individualized approach. In addition, we would advocate incorporating cutting-edge research tools into human studies to advance our understanding of the mechanisms of vitamin D action in extra-skeletal disease. This may involve multi-metabolite analysis of vitamin D metabolites, or unbiased approaches to assess regulation of gene/protein expression in tissues of interest.",Hassan-Smith ZK; Hewison M; Gittoes NJ,British medical bulletin,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28334220/,1,0,0,0,0,1

28318686,Probiotic supplementation for management of cardiovascular risk factors in adults with type II diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The effectiveness of probiotics in control of hypertension and dyslipidemia in diabetic patients remains unclear. Therefore, we systematically reviewed relevant data to elucidate the effects of probiotics on blood pressure and lipid profile of type 2 diabetic patients. We searched PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, The Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses databases until May 2016. The primary outcomes were systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TG). Other biochemical response and adverse effects were considered as secondary outcomes. Data was extracted from included studies and pooled in meta-analysis whenever possible (both standardized mean difference (SMD) analysis and weighted mean difference (WMD) analysis were performed). Eleven eligible randomized controlled trial (n = 641) were identified. Pooling data from these trials demonstrated probiotic consumption significantly decreased SBP (WMD, -3.28 mmHg; 95% confidence interval [CI], -5.38 to -1.18), DBP (WMD, -2.13 mmHg; 95% CI, -4.5 to 0.24), LDL-C (WMD, 8.32 mg/dl; 95% CI, -15.24 to -1.4), TC (WMD, -12.19 mg/dl; 955 CI -17.62 to -6.75) and TG (WMD, -24.48 mg/dl; 95% CI, -33.77 to -11.18) in type 2 diabetic patients compared with placebo. The methodological quality varied across trials included in this study. This systematic review suggests probiotics supplementation may be helpful for control of dyslipidemia and hypertension in type 2 diabetic patients.

Healthy eating practices, maintaining a normal weight, and regular physical activity could prevent up to 80% of coronary heart disease, 90% of type-2 diabetes and onethird of all cancers [1]. Over the last two decades, the food industry has invested much effort in research and development of healthier, more nutritious foods. These foods are frequently designated ""functional"" when they contain nutritional components required for healthy living or ""nutraceuticals"" when intended to treat or prevent disease or disorders through a variety of bioactive (e.g., antioxidant, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, hypocholesterolaemic) functions that are performed by functional enzymes, probiotics, prebiotics, fibres, phytosterols, peptides, proteins, isoflavones, saponins or phytic acid, among other substances. Some agricultural and industrial residues have proven to be excellent choices as raw materials for producing bioactive compounds and have been proposed as potentially safe natural sources of antimicrobials and/or antioxidants for the food industry. Functional food ingredients containing bioactive compounds could be used as plant extracts by pharmaceutical and food industries.

Even modest weight loss may be associated with health benefits. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a naturally occurring antioxidant. Studies have suggested anti-obesity properties of ALA; however, results are inconsistent. The purpose of this study is to conduct a meta-analysis of the effect of ALA on weight and body mass index (BMI). A comprehensive, systematic literature search identified 10 articles on randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies involving ALA. We conducted a meta-analysis of mean weight and BMI change differences between ALA and placebo treatment groups. Alpha-lipoic acid treatment coincided with a statistically significant 1.27 kg (confidence interval = 0.25 to 2.29) greater mean weight loss compared with the placebo group. A significant overall mean BMI difference of -0.43 kg/ m<sup>2</sup> (confidence interval = -0.82 to -0.03) was found between the ALA and placebo groups. Meta-regression analysis showed no significance in ALA dose on BMI and weight changes. Study duration significantly affected BMI change, but not weight change. Alpha-lipoic acid treatment showed small, yet significant short-term weight loss compared with placebo. Further research is needed to examine the effect of different doses and the long-term benefits of ALA on weight management.",Kucukgoncu S; Zhou E; Lucas KB; Tek C,Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28295905/,1,0,0,1,0,0
28294172,Effects of vitamin C supplementation on glycaemic control: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.,"Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have observed contrasting results on the effects of vitamin C on circulating biomarkers of glycaemic and insulin regulation. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs testing the effect of vitamin C administration on glucose, HbA1c and insulin concentrations. Four databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Cochrane Library) were used to retrieve RCTs published from inception until April 2016 and testing the effects of vitamin C in adult participants. The screening of 2008 articles yielded 22 eligible studies (937 participants). Overall, vitamin C did not modify glucose, HbA1c and insulin concentrations. However, subgroup analyses showed that vitamin C significantly reduced glucose concentrations (-0.44 mmol/l, 95% CI: -0.81, -0.07, P=0.01) in patients with type 2 diabetes and in interventions with a duration greater than 30 days (-0.53%, 95% CI: -0.79, -0.10, P=0.02). Vitamin C administration had greater effects on fasting (-13.63 pmol/l, 95% CI: -22.73, -4.54, P<0.01) compared to postprandial insulin concentration. Meta-regression analyses showed that age was a modifier of the effect of vitamin C on insulin concentration. Furthermore, the effect size was associated with baseline BMI and plasma glucose levels, and with the duration of the intervention. In conclusion, greater reduction in glucose concentrations observed in patients with diabetes, older individuals and with more prolonged supplementation. Personalised interventions with vitamin C may represent a feasible future strategy to enhance benefits and efficacy of interventions. Nevertheless, results need to be interpreted cautiously due to limitations in the primary studies analysed.",Ashor AW; Werner AD; Lara J; Willis ND; Mathers JC; Siervo M,European journal of clinical nutrition,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28294172/,0,1,0,1,0,0
28289069,Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (Fish Oil) Supplementation and the Prevention of Clinical Cardiovascular Disease: A Science Advisory From the American Heart Association.,"Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have assessed the effects of supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid (omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, commonly called fish oils) on the occurrence of clinical cardiovascular diseases. Although the effects of supplementation for the primary prevention of clinical cardiovascular events in the general population have not been examined, RCTs have assessed the role of supplementation in secondary prevention among patients with diabetes mellitus and prediabetes, patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease, and those with prevalent coronary heart disease. In this scientific advisory, we take a clinical approach and focus on common indications for omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplements related to the prevention of clinical cardiovascular events. We limited the scope of our review to large RCTs of supplementation with major clinical cardiovascular disease end points; meta-analyses were considered secondarily. We discuss the features of available RCTs and provide the rationale for our recommendations. We then use existing American Heart Association criteria to assess the strength of the recommendation and the level of evidence. On the basis of our review of the cumulative evidence from RCTs designed to assess the effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation on clinical cardiovascular events, we update prior recommendations for patients with prevalent coronary heart disease, and we offer recommendations, when data are available, for patients with other clinical indications, including patients with diabetes mellitus and prediabetes and those with high risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation.",Siscovick DS; Barringer TA; Fretts AM; Wu JH; Lichtenstein AH; Costello RB; Kris-Etherton PM; Jacobson TA; Engler MB; Alger HM; Appel LJ; Mozaffarian D,Circulation,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28289069/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28287463,Stirring the Pot: Can Dietary Modification Alleviate the Burden of CKD?,"Diet is one of the largest modifiable risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD)-related death and disability. CKD is largely a progressive disease; however, it is increasingly appreciated that hallmarks of chronic kidney disease such as albuminuria can regress over time. The factors driving albuminuria resolution remain elusive. Since albuminuria is a strong risk factor for GFR loss, modifiable lifestyle factors that lead to an improvement in albuminuria would likely reduce the burden of CKD in high-risk individuals, such as patients with diabetes. Dietary therapy such as protein and sodium restriction has historically been used in the management of CKD. Evidence is emerging to indicate that other nutrients may influence kidney health, either through metabolic or haemodynamic pathways or via the modification of gut homeostasis. This review focuses on the role of diet in the pathogenesis and progression of CKD and discusses the latest findings related to the mechanisms of diet-induced kidney disease. It is possible that optimizing diet quality or restricting dietary intake could be harnessed as an adjunct therapy for CKD prevention or progression in susceptible individuals, thereby reducing the burden of CKD.",Snelson M; Clarke RE; Coughlan MT,Nutrients,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28287463/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28281103,Current evidence on vitamin D deficiency and kidney transplant: What's new?,"Kidney transplant is the treatment of choice for end-stage chronic kidney disease. Kidneys generate 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) from 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcidiol) for circulation in the blood to regulate calcium levels. Transplant patients with low calcidiol levels have an increased risk of metabolic and endocrine problems, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, poor graft survival, bone disorders, cancer, and mortality rate. The recommended calcidiol level after transplant is at least 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L), which could require 1000-3000 IU/d vitamin D3 to achieve. Vitamin D3 supplementation studies have found improved endothelial function and acute rejection episodes. However, since kidney function may still be impaired, raising calcidiol levels may not lead to normal calcitriol levels. Thus, supplementation with calcitriol or an analog, alfacalcidiol, is often employed. Some beneficial effects found include possible improved bone health and reduced risk of chronic allograft nephropathy and cancer.",Sarno G; Nappi R; Altieri B; Tirabassi G; Muscogiuri E; Salvio G; Paschou SA; Ferrara A; Russo E; Vicedomini D; Vincenzo C; Vryonidou A; Della Casa S; Balercia G; Orio F; De Rosa P,Reviews in endocrine & metabolic disorders,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28281103/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28260263,"Iodine supplementation for women during the preconception, pregnancy and postpartum period.","Iodine is an essential nutrient required for the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones, which are responsible for regulating growth, development and metabolism. Iodine requirements increase substantially during pregnancy and breastfeeding. If requirements are not met during these periods, the production of thyroid hormones may decrease and be inadequate for maternal, fetal and infant needs. The provision of iodine supplements may help meet the increased iodine needs during pregnancy and the postpartum period and prevent or correct iodine deficiency and its consequences. To assess the benefits and harms of supplementation with iodine, alone or in combination with other vitamins and minerals, for women in the preconceptional, pregnancy or postpartum period on their and their children's outcomes. We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (14 November 2016), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (17 November 2016), contacted experts in the field and searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and other relevant papers. Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials with randomisation at either the individual or cluster level comparing injected or oral iodine supplementation (such as tablets, capsules, drops) during preconception, pregnancy or the postpartum period irrespective of iodine compound, dose, frequency or duration. Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, risk of bias, extracted data and conducted checks for accuracy. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence for primary outcomes.We anticipated high heterogeneity among trials, and we pooled trial results using random-effects models and were cautious in our interpretation of the pooled results. We included 14 studies and excluded 48 studies. We identified five ongoing or unpublished studies and two studies are awaiting classification. Eleven trials involving over 2700 women contributed data for the comparisons in this review (in three trials, the primary or secondary outcomes were not reported). Maternal primary outcomesIodine supplementation decreased the likelihood of the adverse effect of postpartum hyperthyroidism by 68% (average risk ratio (RR) 0.32; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 0.91, three trials in mild to moderate iodine deficiency settings, 543 women, no statistical heterogeneity, low-quality evidence) and increased the likelihood of the adverse effect of digestive intolerance in pregnancy by 15 times (average RR 15.33; 95% CI 2.07 to 113.70, one trial in a mild-deficiency setting, 76 women, very low-quality evidence).There were no clear differences between groups for hypothyroidism in pregnancy or postpartum (pregnancy: average RR 1.90; 95% CI 0.57 to 6.38, one trial, 365 women, low-quality evidence, and postpartum: average RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.06 to 3.42, three trials, 540 women, no statistical heterogeneity, low-quality evidence), preterm birth (average RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.30 to 1.66, two trials, 376 women, statistical heterogeneity, low-quality evidence) or the maternal adverse effects of elevated thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO-ab) in pregnancy or postpartum (average RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.44 to 2.07, one trial, 359 women, low-quality evidence, average RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.30, three trials, 397 women, no statistical heterogeneity, low-quality evidence), or hyperthyroidism in pregnancy (average RR 1.90; 95% CI 0.57 to 6.38, one trial, 365 women, low-quality evidence). All of the trials contributing data to these outcomes took place in settings with mild to moderate iodine deficiency. Infant/child primary outcomesCompared with those who did not receive iodine, those who received iodine supplements had a 34% lower likelihood of perinatal mortality, however this difference was not statistically significant (average RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.03, two trials, 457 assessments, low-quality evidence). All of the perinatal deaths occurred in one trial conducted in a severely iodine-deficient setting. There were no clear differences between groups for low birthweight (average RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.26 to 1.23, two trials, 377 infants, no statistical heterogeneity, low-quality evidence), neonatal hypothyroidism/elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (average RR 0.58; 95% CI 0.11 to 3.12, two trials, 260 infants, very low-quality evidence) or the adverse effect of elevated neonatal thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO-ab) (average RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.07 to 5.70, one trial, 108 infants, very low-quality evidence). All of the trials contributing data to these outcomes took place in areas with mild to moderate iodine deficiency. No trials reported on hypothyroidism/elevated TSH or any adverse effect beyond the neonatal period. There were insufficient data to reach any meaningful conclusions on the benefits and harms of routine iodine supplementation in women before, during or after pregnancy. The available evidence suggested that iodine supplementation decreases the likelihood of postpartum hyperthyroidism and increases the likelihood of the adverse effect of digestive intolerance in pregnancy - both considered potential adverse effects. We considered evidence for these outcomes low or very low quality, however, because of study design limitations and wide confidence intervals. In addition, due to the small number of trials and included women in our meta-analyses, these findings must be interpreted with caution. There were no clear effects on other important maternal or child outcomes though these findings must also be interpreted cautiously due to limited data and low-quality trials. Additionally, almost all of the evidence came from settings with mild or moderate iodine deficiency and therefore may not be applicable to settings with severe deficiency.More high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed on iodine supplementation before, during and after pregnancy on maternal and infant/child outcomes. However, it may be unethical to compare iodine to placebo or no treatment in severe deficiency settings. Trials may also be unfeasible in settings where pregnant and lactating women commonly take prenatal supplements with iodine. Information is needed on optimal timing of initiation as well as supplementation regimen and dose. Future trials should consider the outcomes in this review and follow children beyond the neonatal period. Future trials should employ adequate sample sizes, assess potential adverse effects (including the nature and extent of digestive intolerance), and be reported in a way that allows assessment of risk of bias, full data extraction and analysis by the subgroups specified in this review.",Harding KB; Peña-Rosas JP; Webster AC; Yap CM; Payne BA; Ota E; De-Regil LM,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28260263/,0,1,0,1,0,0
28244671,"Prebiotic inulin-type fructans and galacto-oligosaccharides: definition, specificity, function, and application in gastrointestinal disorders.","Prebiotics are non-digestible selectively fermented dietary fibers that specifically promote the growth of one or more bacterial genera in the gastrointestinal tract and thus provide health benefit to the host. The two most investigated prebiotics being the inulin-type fructans and galacto-oligosaccharides. Prebiotic specificity is mediated through species-specific gene clusters within saccharolytic bacteria controlled by signaling sensors for various substrates. Prebiotic health benefits are attributed to immune regulation and bacterial metabolite production. In humans, prebiotic supplementation leads to increased growth of specific gut microbiota (e.g., bifidobacteria), immune modulation, and depending on the bacterial augmentation, short-chain fatty acid production. Irritable bowel syndrome and Crohn's disease are gastrointestinal disorders associated with reductions in some gut bacteria and greater mucosal inflammation. Prebiotic supplementation studies have shown some promise at low doses for modulation of the gut bacteria and reduction of symptoms in IBS; however, larger doses may have neutral or negative impact on symptoms. Studies in Crohn's disease have not shown benefit to bacterial modulation or inflammatory response with prebiotic supplementation. Dietary restriction of fermentable carbohydrates (low FODMAP diet), which restricts some naturally occurring prebiotics from the diet, has shown efficacy in improving symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome, but it lowers the numbers of some key gut microbiota. Further research is required on the effect of prebiotics in gastrointestinal disorders and, in particular, on their use in conjunction with the low FODMAP diet.",Wilson B; Whelan K,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28244671/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28232380,Putative protective role of lutein and zeaxanthin in diabetic retinopathy.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most important microvascular complications of diabetes and remains the leading cause of blindness in the working-age individuals. The exact aetiopathogenesis of DR remains elusive despite major advances in basic science and clinical research. Oxidative damage as one of the underlying causes for DR is increasingly being recognised. In humans, three hydroxycarotenoids, lutein (L), zeaxanthin (Z) and <i>meso</i>-zeaxanthin (MZ), accumulate at the central retina (to the exclusion of all other dietary carotenoids), where they are collectively known as macular pigment. These hydroxycarotenoids by nature of their biochemical structure and function help neutralise reactive oxygen species, and thereby, prevent oxidative damage to the retina (biological antioxidants). Apart from their key antioxidant function, evidence is emerging that these carotenoids may also exhibit neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory function in the retina. Since the preliminary identification of hydroxycarotenoid in the human macula by Wald in the 1940s, there has been astounding progress in our knowledge of the role of these carotenoids in promoting ocular health. While the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 has established a clinical benefit for L and Z supplements in patients with age-related macular degeneration, the role of these carotenoids in other retinal diseases potentially linked to oxidative damage remains unclear. In this article, we comprehensively review the literature germane to the putative protective role of two hydroxycarotenoids, L and Z, in the pathogenesis of DR.",Neelam K; Goenadi CJ; Lun K; Yip CC; Au Eong KG,The British journal of ophthalmology,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28232380/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28230764,Cinnamic Acid and Its Derivatives: Mechanisms for Prevention and Management of Diabetes and Its Complications.,"With recent insight into the development of dietary supplements and functional foods, search of effective phytochemical compounds and their mechanisms involved in prevention and management of diabetes and its complications are now being assessed. Cinnamic acid and its derivatives occur naturally in high levels of plant-based foods. Among various biological activities, cinnamic acid and its derivatives are associated with a beneficial influence on diabetes and its complications. The aim of the review is to summarize the potential mechanisms of these compounds for prevention and management of diabetes and its complications. Based on several in vitro studies and animal models, cinnamic acid and its derivatives act on different mechanism of actions, including stimulation of insulin secretion, improvement of pancreatic β-cell functionality, inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis, enhanced glucose uptake, increased insulin signaling pathway, delay of carbohydrate digestion and glucose absorption, and inhibition of protein glycation and insulin fibrillation. However, due to the limited intestinal absorption being a result of low bioavailability of cinnamic acid and its derivatives, current improvement efforts with entrapping into solid and liquid particles are highlighted. Further human clinical studies are needed to clarify the effects of cinnamic acid and its derivatives in diabetic patients.",Adisakwattana S,Nutrients,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28230764/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Nanomedicine offers an operative tool for the efficient delivery of natural products, in terms of increased bioavailability, targeting, and controlled release while protecting active constituents against physico-chemical alterations. The interest of the scientific community in the field of nanosized delivery of natural compounds is demonstrated by the exponential growth of the publications in this field. Beyond the presentation of successful examples of nanoscale delivery systems containing natural products, the scope of this review is to point out the yet underexplored capacities of this field with relevance for the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical market. Departing from a short presentation of plant-derived natural products and strategies to obtain nanoformulations, the current work discusses nanoparticulate drug delivery systems targeting diseases of various organs and systems: skin, central nervous system, skeletal tissue, cardiovascular apparatus, and diabetes. While notable progress has been achieved in the preparation of nanomedicines containing selected dietary polyphenols, works dealing with crude extracts or standardized fractions are much less frequent. In fact, most of the plants with solidly documented therapeutic properties and registered in pharmacopoeias still wait to benefit from advances in the field of nanotechnology.

28216084,Vitamin D supplementation guidelines.,"Research carried out during the past two-decades extended the understanding of actions of vitamin D, from regulating calcium and phosphate absorption and bone metabolism to many pleiotropic actions in organs and tissues in the body. Most observational and ecological studies report association of higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations with improved outcomes for several chronic, communicable and non-communicable diseases. Consequently, numerous agencies and scientific organizations have developed recommendations for vitamin D supplementation and guidance on optimal serum 25(OH)D concentrations. The bone-centric guidelines recommend a target 25(OH)D concentration of 20ng/mL (50nmol/L), and age-dependent daily vitamin D doses of 400-800IU. The guidelines focused on pleiotropic effects of vitamin D recommend a target 25(OH)D concentration of 30ng/mL (75nmol/L), and age-, body weight-, disease-status, and ethnicity dependent vitamin D doses ranging between 400 and 2000IU/day. The wise and balanced choice of the recommendations to follow depends on one's individual health outcome concerns, age, body weight, latitude of residence, dietary and cultural habits, making the regional or nationwide guidelines more applicable in clinical practice. While natural sources of vitamin D can raise 25(OH)D concentrations, relative to dietary preferences and latitude of residence, in the context of general population, these sources are regarded ineffective to maintain the year-round 25(OH)D concentrations in the range of 30-50ng/mL (75-125nmol/L).

28204459,Preventing vitamin D deficiency (VDD): a systematic review of economic evaluations.,"Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is a public health concern worldwide. If untreated, it can lead to reduced quality of life and escalated costs brought about by ill-health. Preventive programmes to improve population vitamin D status exist but little is known about their cost-effectiveness. This information is vital so that decision-makers adopt efficient strategies and optimise use of public resources. Systematically review and critically appraise economic evaluations of population strategies to prevent VDD. The databases reviewed were MEDLINE, EMBASE, Econlit, NHS EED, CEA, and RepEc. All full economic evaluations of VDD prevention strategies were included. Interventions considered were food fortification, supplementation and public health campaigns. Data extracted included type of evaluation, population, setting, measure of benefit and main results. Of the 2492 records screened, 14 studies were included. The majority of studies focused on supplementation within at-risk groups with the primary objective of either preventing fractures or falls in older adults. There was insufficient economic evidence to draw conclusions about the cost-effectiveness of population strategies. No study was identified that offered a direct comparison of the two main alternative population strategies: food fortification vs. supplementation. Whilst there is a growing body of evidence on the cost-effectiveness of micro nutrient programmes, there is a paucity of data on vitamin D fortification and how fortification programmes compare to population supplementation programmes. We highlight research gaps, and offer suggestions of what is required to undertake population-based cost-effectiveness analysis.",Aguiar M; Andronis L; Pallan M; Högler W; Frew E,European journal of public health,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28204459/,0,1,0,0,0,0

Some of the trace metals are thus essential for maintaining homeostasis, while deficiency of these trace metals can cause disorders with metabolic and physiological imbalances. This article concentrates on three trace metals (selenium, vanadium, and chromium) that may play crucial roles in controlling blood glucose concentrations possibly through their insulin-mimetic effects. For these trace metals, the level of evidence available for their health effects as supplements is weak. Thus, their potential is not fully exploited for the target of metabolic syndrome, a constellation that increases the risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Given that the prevalence of metabolic syndrome is increasing throughout the world, a simpler option of interventions with food supplemented with well-studied trace metals could serve as an answer to this problem. The oxidation state and coordination chemistry play crucial roles in defining the responses to these trace metals, so further research is warranted to understand fully their metabolic and cardiovascular effects in human metabolic syndrome.",Panchal SK; Wanyonyi S; Brown L,Current hypertension reports,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28197835/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Vitamin D deficiency mainly occurs if strict vegetarian diet is followed as mostly the source of vitamin D is animal based; therefore, exposure to sunlight is restricted or having dark skin color. Low vitamin D levels results in increased possibility of gestational diabetes among pregnant women, low birth weight and pre-eclampsia in infants, and mothers may suffer bone impairment, osteoporosis, hypocalcaemia, and hypertension.

28173850,New horizons in treatment of osteoporosis.,"Prevalence of osteoporosis is increasing both in developed and developing countries. Due to rapid growth in the burden and cost of osteoporosis, worldwide, it seems reasonable to focus on the reduction of fractures as the main goal of treatment. Although, efficient pharmacological agents are available for the treatment of osteoporosis, there still remains a need to more specific drugs with less adverse effects. This review article provides a brief update on the pathogenesis, presenting current pharmacological products approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or Europe, and also newer therapeutic agents to treat osteoporosis according to the clinical trial data available at PubMed, UpToDate, International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF), and clinical practice guidelines. As well, the effect of combination therapy and recommendations for future research will be further discussed. The use of current antiresorptive and anabolic agents alone or in combinations for the treatment of osteoporosis entails several limitations. Mainly, their efficacy on non-vertebral fracture reduction is lower than that observed on vertebral fracture. In addition, they have potential adverse events on long time usage. Development of newer agents such as cathepsin k inhibitor and strontium ranelate not only have increased the available options for treating osteoporosis, but also have opened doors of opportunity to improvements in the effective treatment. However, the high cost of new agents have restricted their usage in selective patients who are at high risk of fracture or whom failed response to first line treatment options. Thus, personalized medicine should be considered for future evaluation of genetic risk score and also for environmental exposure assessment. In addition to permanent attention to early diagnosis of osteoporosis and understanding of the pathophysiology of osteoporosis for novel approach in drug discovery, there seems a need to more well-designed clinical trials with larger sample sizes and longer duration on current as well as on newer agents. Also, continuous research on plant-derived components as the source of discovering new agents, and conducting more clinical trials with combination of two or more synthetic drugs, plants, or drug-plant for the treatment of osteoporosis are recommended.

In the present study, a systematic review and a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted aiming to evaluate the effect of magnesium supplementation on type 2 diabetes (T2D) associated cardiovascular risk factors in both diabetic and nondiabetic individuals. PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases were searched from inception to 30 June 2016 aiming to identify RCTs evaluating the effect of magnesium supplementation on T2D associated cardiovascular risk factors. The data were analysed using a random effect model with inverse variance methodology. Sensitivity analysis, risk of bias analysis, subgroup analysis, meta-regression and publication bias analysis were also conducted for the included studies using standard methods. Following magnesium supplementation, a significant improvement was observed in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) [weighted mean difference (WMD) = -4.641 mg dL<sup>-1</sup> , 95% confidence interval (CI) = -7.602, -1.680, P = 0.002], high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (WMD = 3.197 mg dL<sup>-1</sup> , 95% CI = 1.455, 4.938, P < 0.001), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (WMD = -10.668 mg dL<sup>-1</sup> , 95% CI = -19.108, -2.228, P = 0.013), plasma triglycerides (TG) (WMD = -15.323 mg dL<sup>-1</sup> , 95% CI = -28.821, -1.826, P = 0.026) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) (WMD = -3.056 mmHg, 95% CI = -5.509, -0.603, P = 0.015). During subgroup analysis, a more beneficial effect of magnesium supplementation was observed in diabetic subjects with hypomagnesaemia. Magnesium supplementation can produce a favourable effect on FPG, HDL, LDL, TG and SBP. Therefore, magnesium supplementation may decrease the risk T2D associated cardiovascular diseases, although future large RCTs are needed for making robust guidelines for clinical practice.",Verma H; Garg R,Journal of human nutrition and dietetics : the official journal of the British Dietetic Association,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28150351/,0,1,0,1,0,0
28146060,Adenosine Monophosphate (AMP)-Activated Protein Kinase: A New Target for Nutraceutical Compounds.,"<b></b>Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an important energy sensor which is activated by increases in adenosine monophosphate (AMP)/adenosine triphosphate (ATP) ratio and/or adenosine diphosphate (ADP)/ATP ratio, and increases different metabolic pathways such as fatty acid oxidation, glucose transport and mitochondrial biogenesis. In this sense, AMPK maintains cellular energy homeostasis by induction of catabolism and inhibition of ATP-consuming biosynthetic pathways to preserve ATP levels. Several studies indicate a reduction of AMPK sensitivity to cellular stress during aging and this could impair the downstream signaling and the maintenance of the cellular energy balance and the stress resistance. However, several diseases have been related with an AMPK dysfunction. Alterations in AMPK signaling decrease mitochondrial biogenesis, increase cellular stress and induce inflammation, which are typical events of the aging process and have been associated to several pathological processes. In this sense, in the last few years AMPK has been identified as a very interesting target and different nutraceutical compounds are being studied for an interesting potential effect on AMPK induction. In this review, we will evaluate the interaction of the different nutraceutical compounds to induce the AMPK phosphorylation and the applications in diseases such as cancer, type II diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases or cardiovascular diseases.",Marín-Aguilar F; Pavillard LE; Giampieri F; Bullón P; Cordero MD,International journal of molecular sciences,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28146060/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28140326,Altered Transport and Metabolism of Phenolic Compounds in Obesity and Diabetes: Implications for Functional Food Development and Assessment.,"Interest in the application of phenolic compounds from the diet or supplements for the prevention of chronic diseases has grown substantially, but the efficacy of such approaches in humans is largely dependent on the bioavailability and metabolism of these compounds. Although food and dietary factors have been the focus of intense investigation, the impact of disease states such as obesity or diabetes on their absorption, metabolism, and eventual efficacy is important to consider. These factors must be understood in order to develop effective strategies that leverage bioactive phenolic compounds for the prevention of chronic disease. The goal of this review is to discuss the inducible metabolic systems that may be influenced by disease states and how these effects impact the bioavailability and metabolism of dietary phenolic compounds. Because current studies generally report that obesity and/or diabetes alter the absorption and excretion of these compounds, this review includes a description of the absorption, conjugation, and excretion pathways for phenolic compounds and how they are potentially altered in disease states. A possible mechanism that will be discussed related to the modulation of phenolic bioavailability and metabolism may be linked to increased inflammatory status from increased amounts of adipose tissue or elevated plasma glucose concentrations. Although more studies are needed, the translation of benefits derived from dietary phenolic compounds to individuals with obesity or diabetes may require the consideration of dosing strategies or be accompanied by adjunct therapies to improve the bioavailability of these compounds.",Redan BW; Buhman KK; Novotny JA; Ferruzzi MG,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28140326/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The present systematic review aims to discuss zinc's participation in the glycemic control of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) patients. In order to accomplish that, a systematic search was performed in the Pubmed database using the following indexed and theme-related descriptors: ""zinc"" AND ""type 2 diabetes mellitus"", AND MeSH terms related to glycemic control combined with the boolean operator OR. In total, 1078 articles were retrieved from the research, of which 15 articles of original studies conducted with DM2 patients were included, with three being about the effect of mineral supplementation and 12 reporting observational studies. The main findings of these studies consisted of low body contents of zinc and high excretion of zinc in urine. Hyperglycemia was one of the mechanisms that caused these alterations owing to its interference in zinc reabsorption via renal cells. Another evidence was the negative correlation between the glycated hemoglobin percentage (%HbA1c) and the plasma zinc levels. Additionally, it has been observed that zinc supplementation in DM2 patients has improved glycemic control, since the %HbA1c significantly reduced in these individuals. This present review shows the positive effect of adequate zinc levels on glycemic control, whether it is through dietetic ingestion or supplementation, since its role in insulin homeostasis is clear.",de Carvalho GB; Brandão-Lima PN; Maia CS; Barbosa KB; Pires LV,"Biometals : an international journal on the role of metal ions in biology, biochemistry, and medicine",2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28138861/,0,1,0,0,0,0
28120718,Nutraceuticals and Dietary Supplements to Improve Quality of Life and Outcomes in Heart Failure Patients.,"Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome that can result from any structural or functional cardiac disorder that impairs the ability of the ventricle to fill or eject blood. It represents a major public health issue, with a prevalence of over 23 million worldwide. The lifetime risk of developing HF is one in five and the most important risk factors identified are ischemic heart disease, hypertension, smoking, obesity and diabetes. Preventive approaches are based on improvements of lifestyle, associated with pharmacological therapy. Several nutraceuticals have shown interesting clinical results in prevention of HF as well as in the treatment of the early stages of the disease, alone or in association with pharmacological therapy. The aim of this review is to resume the available clinical evidence on phytochemicals effect on HF prevention and/or treatment. A systematic search strategy was developed to identify trials in PubMed (January 1980 to April 2016). The terms 'nutraceuticals', 'dietary supplements', 'herbal drug' and 'heart failure' were incorporated into an electronic search strategy. Clinical trials reported that the intake of some nutraceuticals (hawthorn, coenzyme Q10, L-carnitine, Dribose, Carnosine, Vitamin D, Some probiotics, Omega-3 PUFAs, Beet nitrates) is associated with improvements in functional parameters such as ejection fraction, stroke volume and cardiac output in HF patients, with minimal side effects. These findings were sometimes reinforced by subsequent meta-analyses, which further concluded that benefits tended to be greater in earlier stage HF. The main mechanisms involved are antioxidant, antinflammatory, anti-ischemic and antiaggregant effects. Evidence suggests that the supplementation with nutraceuticals may be a useful option for effective management of HF, with the advantage of excellent clinical tolerance.",Cicero AFG; Colletti A,Current pharmaceutical design,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28120718/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28096141,The Role of the Novel Lipokine Palmitoleic Acid in Health and Disease.,"The monounsaturated fatty acid palmitoleate (palmitoleic acid) is one of the most abundant fatty acids in serum and tissues, particularly adipose tissue and liver. Its endogenous production by stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 gives rise to its cis isoform, cis-palmitoleate. Although trans-palmitoleate is also synthesized in humans, it is mainly found as an exogenous source in ruminant fat and dairy products. Recently, palmitoleate was considered to be a lipokine based on evidence demonstrating its release from adipose tissue and its metabolic effects on distant organs. After this finding, research has been performed to determine whether palmitoleate has beneficial effects on metabolism and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Thus, the aim of this work was to review the current status of knowledge about palmitoleate, its metabolism, and its influence on metabolic abnormalities. Results have shown mixed cardiovascular effects, direct or inverse correlations with obesity, and hepatosteatosis, but a significant amelioration or prevention of insulin resistance and diabetes. Finally, the induction of palmitoleate release from adipose tissue, dietary intake, and its supplementation are all interventions with a potential impact on certain metabolic diseases.",Frigolet ME; Gutiérrez-Aguilar R,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28096141/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28086820,Primary prevention of gestational diabetes mellitus through nutritional factors: a systematic review.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), defined as any degree of glucose intolerance with onset during pregnancy, is increasing worldwide, mostly because obesity among women of reproductive age is continuously escalating. GDM is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. The aim of this article was to systematically review literature on the effectiveness of nutritional factors before or during pregnancy to prevent GDM. We assessed the primary prevention of GDM through nutritional factors, as diet and supplements. We searched on PubMed, Cochrane Databases and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to June 2016. Clinical trials and adjusted prospective cohort studies were included. Eight clinical trials and twenty observational studies assessing the association between dietary factors and primary prevention of GDM were included. Furthermore, six clinical trials and two observational studies related to supplements were also added. Only two nutritional interventions were found to significantly reduce the incidence of GDM, besides the supplements. However, the observational studies showed that a higher adherence to a healthier dietary pattern can prevent the incidence of GDM, especially in high risk population before getting pregnant. The results indicate that there may be some benefits of some nutritional factors to prevent GDM. However, better-designed studies are required to generate higher quality evidence. At the moment, no strong conclusions can be drawn with regard to the best intervention for the prevention of GDM.",Donazar-Ezcurra M; López-Del Burgo C; Bes-Rastrollo M,BMC pregnancy and childbirth,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28086820/,0,1,0,0,0,1

From the 28,164 studies, 11 RCTs (13 interventions, 723 patients, 54% males) with 3 to 52 weeks of follow-up were classified according to the type of micronutrient intervention: sodium (n = 1), vitamin C (n = 2), vitamin D (n = 7), and magnesium (n = 1). The available data enabled us to perform meta-analyses of vitamins C and D. Vitamin C reduced diastolic BP [WMD -2.88 mmHg (95%CI -5.31, -0.46; P = 0.020)] but not systolic BP [WMD -3.93 mmHg (95%CI -14.78, 6.92; P = 0.478)]. Vitamin D caused a reduction of 4.56 mmHg (WMD; 95%CI -7.65, -1.47; P = 0.004) for systolic BP and 2.44 mm Hg (WMD; 95%CI -3.49, -1.39; P < 0.001) for diastolic BP. In conclusion, vitamin D and possibly vitamin C have beneficial effects on BP in patients with type 2 diabetes.

28071785,"Bioactive polyphenols and cardiovascular disease: chemical antagonists, pharmacological agents or xenobiotics that drive an adaptive response?","Polyphenols are widely regarded to have a wide range of health-promoting qualities, including beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease. Historically, the benefits have been linked to their well-recognized powerful antioxidant activity. However, the concept that the beneficial effects are attributable to direct antioxidant activity in vivo does not pay sufficient heed to the fact that polyphenols degrade rapidly, are poorly absorbed and rapidly metabolized, resulting in very low bioavailability. This review explores alternative mechanisms by which polyphenols, or their metabolites, exert biological activity via mechanisms that can be activated by physiologically relevant concentrations. Evidence is presented to support the action of phenolic derivatives on receptors and signalling pathways to induce adaptive responses that drive changes in endogenous antioxidant, antiplatelet, vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory effects. The implications are that in vitro antioxidant measures as predictors of polyphenol protective activity in vivo hold little relevance and that closer attention needs to be paid to bioavailable metabolites to understand the mode of action of these diet-derived components.

28031147,Review: Effects of maternal micronutrient supplementation on placental function.,"Pregnancy is a physiological challenge that may require additional nutritional support. Suboptimal micronutrient intakes and micronutrient deficiencies during pregnancy are a global problem, often leading to poor maternal and child outcomes. Micronutrient supplementation is commonly recommended during pregnancy to support and enhance maternal metabolism. Recent studies suggest that the use of multiple micronutrient supplements may be of benefit during a normal pregnancy and may significantly reduce the risk of preeclampsia, preterm delivery, gestational diabetes, and improve pregnancy outcomes. Given the crucial role that the placenta plays in mediating pregnancy outcomes, it is important to consider the impact of micronutrient supplementation on the mechanisms associated with placental function, as well as maternal and fetal homeostasis.

Many health-promoting benefits have been connected with resveratrol in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, inflammation, neurodegeneration, and diseases connected with aging. To explain the pleiotropic effects of resveratrol, the molecular targets of this compound have to be identified on the cellular level. Resveratrol induces intracellular signal transduction pathways which ultimately lead to changes in the gene expression pattern of the cells. Here, we review the effect of resveratrol on the activation of the stimulus-responsive transcription factors CREB, AP-1, Egr-1, Elk-1, and Nrf2. Following activation, these transcription factors induce transcription of delayed response genes. The gene products of these delayed response genes are ultimately responsible for the changes in the biochemistry and physiology of resveratrol-treated cells. The activation of stimulus-responsive transcription factors may explain many of the intracellular activities of resveratrol.

28001086,Bioactive whey peptide particles: An emerging class of nutraceutical carriers.,"Whey-based diets have been linked with prolonged life expectancy and improved physical performance. These observations based on numerous clinical and simulated studies are attributed to diverse biological activities of whey peptides. Recently, bioactive whey peptides were exploited for enveloping nutraceuticals and drugs in view of fabricating capsules that the carrier matrix is also bioactive. Some of the most considered bioactivities of whey peptides including antihypertension, antioxidant, anti-obesity, anti-diabetes, and hypocholesterolemic properties with corresponding underlying mechanisms are briefly discussed. Then, we overview the supramolecular and gelation-prompted encapsulation of nutraceuticals with whey proteins, followed by summarizing recent developments in utilization of synthetic peptides for gene and drug delivery. Finally, particulation of bioactive whey peptides are communicated. Whey peptides may exert both biologically beneficial and technologically appreciated activities. Two procedures including desolvation and internal gelation have been so far employed for bioactive peptides particulation. Crosslinking is a prerequisite to confer acid-induced cold-set gelation to bioactive peptides. It also increases peptides Fe<sup>3+</sup>-reducing power. Surface activity of a population of peptides in whey protein hydrolysate may result in co-adsorption of the peptides together with small molecule surfactants onto oil-water interface, leading to modulated interfacial architecture and particle morphology.",Madadlou A; Abbaspourrad A,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28001086/,1,0,0,0,0,0
27996085,Supportive interventions for enhancing dietary intake in malnourished or nutritionally at-risk adults.,"Supportive interventions such as serving meals in a dining room environment or the use of assistants to feed patients are frequently recommended for the management of nutritionally vulnerable groups. Such interventions are included in many policy and guideline documents and have implications for staff time but may incur additional costs, yet there appears to be a lack of evidence for their efficacy. To assess the effects of supportive interventions for enhancing dietary intake in malnourished or nutritionally at-risk adults. We identified publications from comprehensive searches of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, British Nursing Index, CINAHL, SCOPUS, ISI Web of Science databases, scrutiny of the reference lists of included trials and related systematic reviews and handsearching the abstracts of relevant meetings. The date of the last search for all databases was 31 March 2013. Additional searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP were undertaken to September 2016. The date of the last search for these databases was 14 September 2016. Randomised controlled trials of supportive interventions given with the aim of enhancing dietary intake in nutritionally vulnerable adults compared with usual care. Three review authors and for the final search, the editor, selected trials from titles and abstracts and independently assessed eligibility of selected trials. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias, as well as evaluating overall quality of the evidence utilising the GRADE instrument, and then agreed as they entered data into the review. The likelihood of clinical heterogeneity amongst trials was judged to be high as trials were in populations with widely different clinical backgrounds, conducted in different healthcare settings and despite some grouping of similar interventions, involved interventions that varied considerably. We were only able, therefore, to conduct meta-analyses for the outcome measures, 'all-cause mortality', 'hospitalisation' and 'nutritional status (weight change)'. Forty-one trials (10,681 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Trials were grouped according to similar interventions (changes to organisation of nutritional care (N = 13; 3456 participants), changes to the feeding environment (N = 5; 351 participants), modification of meal profile or pattern (N = 12; 649 participants), additional supplementation of meals (N = 10; 6022 participants) and home meal delivery systems (N = 1; 203 participants). Follow-up ranged from 'duration of hospital stay' to 12 months.The overall quality of evidence was moderate to very low, with the majority of trials judged to be at an unclear risk of bias in several risk of bias domains. The risk ratio (RR) for all-cause mortality was 0.78 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 0.92); P = 0.004; 12 trials; 6683 participants; moderate-quality evidence. This translates into 26 (95% CI 9 to 41) fewer cases of death per 1000 participants in favour of supportive interventions. The RR for number of participants with any medical complication ranged from 1.42 in favour of control compared with 0.59 in favour of supportive interventions (very low-quality evidence). Only five trials (4451 participants) investigated health-related quality of life showing no substantial differences between intervention and comparator groups. Information on patient satisfaction was unreliable. The effects of supportive interventions versus comparators on hospitalisation showed a mean difference (MD) of -0.5 days (95% CI -2.6 to 1.6); P = 0.65; 5 trials; 667 participants; very low-quality evidence. Only three of 41 included trials (4108 participants; very low-quality evidence) reported on adverse events, describing intolerance to the supplement (diarrhoea, vomiting; 5/34 participants) and discontinuation of oral nutritional supplements because of refusal or dislike of taste (567/2017 participants). Meta-analysis across 17 trials with adequate data on weight change revealed an overall improvement in weight in favour of supportive interventions versus control: MD 0.6 kg (95% CI 0.21 to 1.02); 2024 participants; moderate-quality evidence. A total of 27 trials investigated nutritional intake with a majority of trials not finding marked differences in energy intake between intervention and comparator groups. Only three trials (1152 participants) reported some data on economic costs but did not use accepted health economic methods (very low-quality evidence). There is evidence of moderate to very low quality to suggest that supportive interventions to improve nutritional care results in minimal weight gain. Most of the evidence for the lower risk of all-cause mortality for supportive interventions comes from hospital-based trials and more research is needed to confirm this effect. There is very low-quality evidence regarding adverse effects; therefore whilst some of these interventions are advocated at a national level clinicians should recognise the lack of clear evidence to support their role. This review highlights the importance of assessing patient-important outcomes in future research.",Baldwin C; Kimber KL; Gibbs M; Weekes CE,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27996085/,0,1,0,1,0,1
27966571,Vitamin D and serum leptin: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies and randomized controlled trials.,"We aimed to investigate the potential association between vitamin D and serum leptin levels by pooling together the results from observational studies and clinical trials. A systematic literature search of PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar was conducted up to March 2015. The analysis of observational studies was conducted on six papers that reported nine correlation coefficients using Fisher's Z and its standard error. Then, effect sizes of eligible trials were pooled using random-effects models (the DerSimonian-Laird estimator). Results of observational studies showed an inverse association between leptin and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) (Fisher's Z=-0.93, 95% CI: -0.95, -0.91). After combining trials, pooled mean difference (PMD) for 25(OH)D was 24.06 ng/ml (95% CI, 17.27-30.85; P<0.001) with significant heterogeneity among studies (P<0.001; I<sup>2</sup>=89.1%). Raising 25(OH)D was associated with significant increase in leptin level (PMD=4.60 ng/ml, 95% CI, 0.55-8.66, P=0.026) with significant heterogeneity (P<0.001; I<sup>2</sup>=96.4%). Population with diabetes (PMD: 13.63 ng/ml), age younger than 50 years (PMD: 1.884 ng/ml), doses less than 1000 IU/day (PMD: 1.53 ng/ml), duration less than 24 weeks (PMD: 14.668 ng/ml) and baseline 25(OH)D <50 nmol/l (PMD: 13.483 ng/ml) were sources of heterogeneity. Current evidence indicates that inverse association between leptin level and 25(OH)D concentration was observed in observational studies, which was not demonstrated in intervention studies with high heterogeneity. Clearly, there is a need for properly designed and large prospective dose-response trials with long-term follow-up to assess the sources of heterogeneity.",Hajimohammadi M; Shab-Bidar S; Neyestani TR,European journal of clinical nutrition,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27966571/,0,1,0,1,0,1
27931032,Fatty Acid Oxidation and Its Relation with Insulin Resistance and Associated Disorders.,"Alterations in muscle fatty acid metabolism have been implicated in mediating the severity of insulin resistance. In the insulin resistant heart fatty acids are favored as an energy source over glucose, which is thus associated with increased fatty acid oxidation, and an overall decrease in glycolysis and glucose oxidation. In addition, excessive uptake and beta-oxidation of fatty acids in obesity and diabetes can compromise cardiac function. In animal studies, mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) show cardiac insulin resistance in which the accumulation of intra-myocardial diacylglycerol has been implicated, likely involving parallel signaling pathways. A HFD also results in accumulation of fatty acid oxidation byproducts in muscle, further contributing to insulin resistance. Carnitine acetyltransferase (CrAT) has an essential role in the cardiomyocyte because of its need for large amounts of carnitine. In the cardiomyocyte, carnitine switches energy substrate preference in the heart from fatty acid oxidation to glucose oxidation. This carnitine-induced switch in fatty acid oxidation to glucose oxidation is due to the presence of cytosolic CrAT and reverse CrAT activity. Accordingly, inhibition of fatty acid oxidation, or stimulation of CrAT, may be a novel approach to treatment of insulin resistance.",Lopaschuk GD,Annals of nutrition & metabolism,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27931032/,1,0,0,0,0,0
27914511,Gas chromatography determination of fatty acids in the human erythrocyte membranes - A review.,"Blood fatty acid measurements can reflect exogenously consumed fatty acids allowing to resolve some metabolic disorders (e.g. diabetes, anorexia) or mental disorders (e.g. depression, anxiety, schizophrenia). For this purpose, fatty acids can be determined in the whole blood or various blood fractions such as the plasma, serum or erythrocytes. Measurement of fatty acids in the whole blood by dried blood spot technique is becoming increasingly popular and is often used mainly for the screening of newborns due to the use of the small sample volume. The most popular is determination of fatty acids in plasma or serum samples. While the profile of plasma fatty acids fluctuates based on daily dietary intake, the red blood cell membrane composition of fatty acids reflects the 2-3 month dietary intake. Such results can be more reflective in contrast to the plasma/serum and therefore the present review will summarize available information on gas chromatography determination of fatty acids in human red blood cell membranes. Selection of extraction and derivatization reagents as well as presentation of chromatographic conditions will be discussed here.",Bystrická Z; Ďuračková Z,"Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids",2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27914511/,1,0,0,0,0,0
27910808,Magnesium and depression.,"Magnesium is one of the most important elements in the human body and is involved in a number of biochemical processes crucial for the proper functioning of the cardiovascular, alimentary, endocrine, and osteoarticular systems. It also plays a vital modulatory role in brain biochemistry, influencing several neurotransmission pathways associated with the development of depression. Personality changes, including apathy, depression, agitation, confusion, anxiety, and delirium are observed when there is a deficiency of this element. Rodents receiving a diet deficient in magnesium displayed depressive behaviour that was reversed by antidepressant drugs. Poor nutrition, gastrointestinal and renal diseases, insulin resistance and/or type 2 diabetes, alcoholism, stress, and certain medications may lead to magnesium deficiency. Since the extracellular concentration of magnesium ions may not reflect their intracellular level, none of the current methods of evaluating magnesium status is regarded as satisfactory. The mood-improving potential of magnesium compounds have been confirmed by the results of numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies. It seems that magnesium supplementation is well-tolerated and enhances the efficacy of conventional antidepressant treatments, and as such could be a valuable addition to the standard treatments for depression, although differences in bioavailability between inorganic and organic compounds should be taken into consideration.",Serefko A; Szopa A; Poleszak E,Magnesium research,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27910808/,1,0,0,0,0,0

27826066,Plant polyphenols as natural drugs for the management of Down syndrome and related disorders.,"Polyphenols are secondary metabolites of plants largely found in fruits, vegetables, cereals and beverages, and therefore represent important constituents of the human diet. Increasing studies have demonstrated the potential beneficial effects of polyphenols on human health. Extensive reviews have discussed the protective effects of polyphenols against a series of diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. Limited studies have investigated the potential therapeutic effects of these natural compounds on neurodevelopmental disorders associated with intellectual disability, such as Down syndrome (DS), for which mitochondrial dysfunctions and oxidative stress are hallmarks and contribute to the deleterious symptoms and cognitive decline. This review, starting from the structure, source, bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of relevant polyphenols, highlights recent studies on the effect and potential molecular mechanism(s) of action of the phenolic compounds epigallocatechin-3-gallate, resveratrol and hydroxytyrosol in restoring mitochondrial energy deficit and in reversing phenotypical alteration in DS. The clinical implications of plant polyphenol dietary supplements as therapeutic tools in managing DS and other intellectual disability-related diseases, is also discussed.",Vacca RA; Valenti D; Caccamese S; Daglia M; Braidy N; Nabavi SM,Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27826066/,1,0,0,0,0,0
27636731,Anti-obesogenic and antidiabetic effects of plants and mushrooms.,"Obesity is reaching global epidemic proportions as a result of factors such as high-calorie diets and lack of physical exercise. Obesity is now considered to be a medical condition, which not only contributes to the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and cancer, but also negatively affects longevity and quality of life. To combat this epidemic, anti-obesogenic approaches are required that are safe, widely available and inexpensive. Several plants and mushrooms that are consumed in traditional Chinese medicine or as nutraceuticals contain antioxidants, fibre and other phytochemicals, and have anti-obesogenic and antidiabetic effects through the modulation of diverse cellular and physiological pathways. These effects include appetite reduction, modulation of lipid absorption and metabolism, enhancement of insulin sensitivity, thermogenesis and changes in the gut microbiota. In this Review, we describe the molecular mechanisms that underlie the anti-obesogenic and antidiabetic effects of these plants and mushrooms, and propose that combining these food items with existing anti-obesogenic approaches might help to reduce obesity and its complications.",Martel J; Ojcius DM; Chang CJ; Lin CS; Lu CC; Ko YF; Tseng SF; Lai HC; Young JD,Nature reviews.

27680989,Do ω-3 PUFAs affect insulin resistance in a sex-specific manner? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Evidence has suggested that omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) improve obesity-induced insulin resistance (IR); however, results from human intervention trials have been equivocal. Recently it has been reported that n-3 PUFA status is inversely associated with type 2 diabetes in women but not in men, suggesting a sex-dependent effect. We aimed to determine whether n-3 PUFA interventions affect IR in a sex-dependent manner. Five databases were searched (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, and Pre-Medline) for randomized controlled trials. Searches were limited to the English language and to studies with adults aged >18 y. When possible, studies were pooled for a meta-analysis. The principle summary measure was the standardized mean difference (SMD) between groups. Thirty-one eligible trials were identified with a total of 1848 participants [men: 45.1%; weighted mean ± SD age: 52.5 ± 8.2 y; weighted body mass index (in kg/m<sup>2</sup>): 28.8 ± 3.0]. Seven studies were conducted in women, 4 studies were conducted in men, and the remaining studies pooled men and women together. Twenty-six trials were pooled for the meta-analysis (men: n = 2; women: n = 6). With all studies (n = 26) pooled, there was no effect of n-3 PUFA on IR at the group level (SMD: 0.089; 95% CI: -0.105, 0.283; P = 0.367). In trials of ≥6 wk, a significant improvement in IR was seen in women (SMD: -0.266; 95% CI: -0.524, -0.007; P = 0.045) but not in men (SMD: 0.619; 95% CI: -0.583, 1.820; P = 0.313). With this analysis, we provide preliminary evidence of a sex-dependent response of IR to an n-3 PUFA intervention. Additional studies are needed to confirm sex-dependent associations and to elucidate the potential mechanisms that are involved.

27618575,Do Cinnamon Supplements Have a Role in Glycemic Control in Type 2 Diabetes? A Narrative Review.,"Cinnamon (Cinnamomum sp) has been suggested to help patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) achieve better glycemic control, although conclusions from meta-analyses are mixed. To evaluate whether the use of cinnamon dietary supplements by adults with T2DM had clinically meaningful effects on glycemic control, as measured by changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a comprehensive PubMed literature search was performed. Eleven randomized controlled trials were identified that met our inclusion criteria that enrolled 694 adults with T2DM receiving hypoglycemic medications or not. In 10 of the studies, participants continued to take their hypoglycemic medications during the cinnamon intervention period. Studies ranged from 4 to 16 weeks in duration; seven studies were double-blind. Cinnamon doses ranged from 120 to 6,000 mg/day. The species of cinnamon used varied: seven used Cinnamomum cassia or Cinnamomum aromaticum, one used Cinnamomum zeylanicum, and three did not disclose the species. Because of the heterogeneity of the studies, a meta-analysis was not conducted. All 11 of the studies reported some reductions in FPG during the cinnamon intervention, and of the studies measuring HbA1c very modest decreases were also apparent with cinnamon, whereas changes in the placebo groups were minimal. However, only four studies achieved the American Diabetes Association treatment goals (FPG <7.2 mmol/L [130 mg/dL] and/or HbAlc <7.0). We conclude that cinnamon supplements added to standard hypoglycemic medications and other lifestyle therapies had modest effects on FPG and HbA1c. Until larger and more rigorous studies are available, registered dietitian nutritionists and other health care professionals should recommend that patients continue to follow existing recommendations of authoritative bodies for diet, lifestyle changes, and hypoglycemic drugs.",Costello RB; Dwyer JT; Saldanha L; Bailey RL; Merkel J; Wambogo E,Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27618575/,1,0,0,0,0,0
27613382,Nutraceuticals: A paradigm of proactive medicine.,"Nutraceuticals define a new category which shades the frontier between drugs and food. As per its definition, a nutraceutical is ""a food or part of a food that provides benefits health in addition to its nutritional content"". Active substances either way extracted from plants (phytocomplexes) or of animal origin, when extracted, concentrated and administered in a suitable pharmaceutical form, can create a very promising toolbox useful to prevent and/or support the therapy of some pathologic conditions given their proven clinical efficacy. It is worldwide recognized that diet and lifestyle are essential to promote and maintain well-being and nice-being condition, other than help to prevent diseases possible onset. Both non-correct dietary habits and lifestyle can in fact determine pathological conditions. The metabolic syndrome, a worldwide epidemic threat, can be named an outstanding example. This syndrome is characterized by a cascade of cardio metabolic risk factors which include obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Prevention is the key strategy for an effective proactive medicine, in which efforts are addressed to prevention and, consequently, to lower the risk connected to some lifestyle related diseases reducing, at the same time, any National Health Systems cost needed to guarantee the proper therapeutic approach based on pharmaceuticals. Nutraceuticals use in prevention is a proactive reverse approach tool to pre-clinical health conditions. They can be effectively used, by including in the daily diet, in an area which shades in the range ""beyond the diet, before drugs"", since they combine both nutritional and beneficial healthy properties of food extracts with the healing properties of natural active compounds.",Santini A; Tenore GC; Novellino E,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27613382/,1,0,0,0,0,0
27638647,Branched-chain amino acids differently modulate catabolic and anabolic states in mammals: a pharmacological point of view.,"Substantial evidence has been accumulated suggesting that branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation or BCAA-rich diets have a positive effect on the regulation of body weight, muscle protein synthesis, glucose homeostasis, the ageing process and extend healthspan. Despite these beneficial effects, epidemiological studies have shown that BCAA plasma concentrations and BCAA metabolism are altered in several metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. In this review article, we present an overview of the current literature on the different effects of BCAAs in health and disease. We also highlight the results showing the most promising therapeutic effects of dietary BCAA supplementation and discuss how BCAAs can trigger different and even opposite effects, depending on the catabolic and anabolic states of the organisms. Moreover, we consider the effects of BCAAs when metabolism is abnormal, in the presence of a mixture of different anabolic and catabolic signals. These unique pharmacodynamic properties may partially explain some of the markedly different effects found in BCAA supplementation studies. To predict accurately these effects, the overall catabolic/anabolic status of patients should be carefully considered. In wider terms, a correct modulation of metabolic disorders would make nutraceutical interventions with BCAAs more effective.

27493144,Calciotropic and phosphaturic hormones in heart failure.,"Despite adherence to evidence-based guidelines, heart failure [HF] still results in 5-year mortality rates of 50%, indicating a need to implement additional preventive/intervention strategies. This review summarizes data on alterations in the calciotropic and phosphaturic hormones 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D] and fibroblast growth factors-23 [FGF-23] in HF and discusses non-pharmacological measures for targeting these hormones. The role of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D in the regulation of calcium and phosphate homeostasis is central. 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D also plays a pivotal role in cardiac function, but is downregulated by FGF-23. There is accumulating evidence from epidemiological data that HF is associated with decreased circulating 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D and elevated FGF-23 levels. In patients with failing hearts, very low 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D and extremely high FGF-23 levels have been reported. Experimental data support the assumption that vitamin D deficiency and high serum phosphate/FGF-23 levels increase the risk of HF. This review provides a hypothesis of how vitamin D deficiency, high calcium/phosphorus intake, physical inactivity, and age-related renal impairment may all contribute to HF by adversely affecting calcium- and phosphate-regulating hormones. Several case series in infants and a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in adults have already reported successful treatment of or a significant risk reduction in HF by vitamin D supplements. The association of calcium/phosphorus intake, physical activity, or renal function with calciotropic/phosphaturic hormones and HF is however less well documented. More attention should be paid in future to the association of circulating 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D and FGF-23 levels with HF and to (non-pharmacological) measures for targeting these calciotropic/phosphaturic hormones.",Zittermann A; Ernst JB,"Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27493144/,1,0,0,0,0,0
27770867,Stability of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate and its activity in liquid formulations and delivery systems.,"(-)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) has become a popular disease-preventive supplement worldwide because it may aid in slowing down the onset of age-related diseases such as cancer, diabetes and tissue degeneration. As largely demonstrated in cell culture studies, EGCG possesses antioxidant properties and exhibits favorable effects on gene expression, signal transduction and other cell functions. However, only limited effects have been observed in experimental animals and human epidemiological studies. The inconsistency between the biological activity of EGCG in cell cultures and in vivo can be attributed to its low stability, which not only decreases its bioavailability but also leads to the formation of degradation products and prooxidant molecules with possible side-effects. Understanding EGCG degradation kinetics in solution and in vivo is crucial for its successful clinical application. Ambient conditions (pH, temperature, oxygen) can either enhance or decrease the stability of EGCG, thus influencing its biological activity. Usage of stabilizers and/or encapsulation of EGCG into particulate systems such as nanoparticles or microparticles can significantly increase its stability. In this review, the effects of ambient conditions, stabilizers and encapsulation systems on EGCG stability, activity and degradation rate are illustrated.",Krupkova O; Ferguson SJ; Wuertz-Kozak K,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27770867/,1,0,0,0,0,0
27638428,"Curcumin, the golden nutraceutical: multitargeting for multiple chronic diseases.","Curcumin, a yellow pigment in the Indian spice Turmeric (Curcuma longa), which is chemically known as diferuloylmethane, was first isolated exactly two centuries ago in 1815 by two German Scientists, Vogel and Pelletier. However, according to the pubmed database, the first study on its biological activity as an antibacterial agent was published in 1949 in Nature and the first clinical trial was reported in The Lancet in 1937. Although the current database indicates almost 9000 publications on curcumin, until 1990 there were less than 100 papers published on this nutraceutical. At the molecular level, this multitargeted agent has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity through the suppression of numerous cell signalling pathways including NF-κB, STAT3, Nrf2, ROS and COX-2. Numerous studies have indicated that curcumin is a highly potent antimicrobial agent and has been shown to be active against various chronic diseases including various types of cancers, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological and autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, this compound has also been shown to be synergistic with other nutraceuticals such as resveratrol, piperine, catechins, quercetin and genistein. To date, over 100 different clinical trials have been completed with curcumin, which clearly show its safety, tolerability and its effectiveness against various chronic diseases in humans. However, more clinical trials in different populations are necessary to prove its potential against different chronic diseases in humans.

27723080,The potential health effects of dietary phytoestrogens.,"Phytoestrogens are plant-derived dietary compounds with structural similarity to 17-β-oestradiol (E2), the primary female sex hormone. This structural similarity to E2 enables phytoestrogens to cause (anti)oestrogenic effects by binding to the oestrogen receptors. The aim of the present review is to present a state-of-the-art overview of the potential health effects of dietary phytoestrogens. Various beneficial health effects have been ascribed to phytoestrogens, such as a lowered risk of menopausal symptoms like hot flushes and osteoporosis, lowered risks of cardiovascular disease, obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, brain function disorders, breast cancer, prostate cancer, bowel cancer and other cancers. In contrast to these beneficial health claims, the (anti)oestrogenic properties of phytoestrogens have also raised concerns since they might act as endocrine disruptors, indicating a potential to cause adverse health effects. The literature overview presented in this paper illustrates that several potential health benefits of phytoestrogens have been reported but that, given the data on potential adverse health effects, the current evidence on these beneficial health effects is not so obvious that they clearly outweigh the possible health risks. Furthermore, the data currently available are not sufficient to support a more refined (semi) quantitative risk-benefit analysis. This implies that a definite conclusion on possible beneficial health effects of phytoestrogens cannot be made.

27754451,"Association between Maternal Zinc Status, Dietary Zinc Intake and Pregnancy Complications: A Systematic Review.","Adequate zinc stores in the body are extremely important during periods of accelerated growth. However, zinc deficiency is common in developing countries and low maternal circulating zinc concentrations have previously been associated with pregnancy complications. We reviewed current literature assessing circulating zinc and dietary zinc intake during pregnancy and the associations with preeclampsia (PE); spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB); low birthweight (LBW); and gestational diabetes (GDM). Searches of MEDLINE; CINAHL and Scopus databases identified 639 articles and 64 studies were reviewed. In 10 out of 16 studies a difference was reported with respect to circulating zinc between women who gave birth to a LBW infant (≤2500 g) and those who gave birth to an infant of adequate weight (>2500 g), particularly in populations where inadequate zinc intake is prevalent. In 16 of our 33 studies an association was found between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and circulating zinc; particularly in women with severe PE (blood pressure ≥160/110 mmHg). No association between maternal zinc status and sPTB or GDM was seen; however; direct comparisons between the studies was difficult. Furthermore; only a small number of studies were based on women from populations where there is a high risk of zinc deficiency. Therefore; the link between maternal zinc status and pregnancy success in these populations cannot be established.

Conjugated linoleic acids have been studied for their beneficial effects in the prevention and treatment of many diseases, including obesity, cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Scientific information put together the physiological properties of CLA, which serves as inputs to claim their potential as functional ingredients to be used in the prevention and control of several chronic metabolic disorders.",Fuke G; Nornberg JL,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27636835/,1,0,0,0,0,0
27537278,Changes in circulating vitamin D levels with loss of adipose tissue.,"Low vitamin D levels have been extensively reported in obesity. Thus, the pandemic of obesity has been paralleled by a high prevalence of low vitamin D status. Given the well documented associations linking poor vitamin D status to adverse health outcomes (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancers, all-cause mortality), a proper understanding of the mechanisms linking excess adiposity to low vitamin D status is key to identify and implement effective interventions to replenish vitamin D levels in obese individuals. In this review, we will discuss recent literature investigating the effects of adipose tissue volume loss through energy restriction and/or physical activity on circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels. Improvements of circulating 25(OH)D levels with adiposity loss through lifestyle interventions without supplementation is being reported by a growing number of studies, including recent randomized controlled trials. Low 25(OH)D is one of the metabolic disturbances associated with excess adiposity, particularly visceral adiposity. Recommendations for the treatment of obesity-related vitamin D deficiency should emphasize the role of visceral adiposity loss through healthy lifestyle habits, in conjunction with weight-adjusted vitamin D supplementation, not only to replenish 25(OH)D levels but also to address other visceral adiposity-related disturbances, such as insulin resistance, inflammation, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.",Gangloff A; Bergeron J; Lemieux I; Després JP,Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27537278/,1,0,0,0,0,0

27721914,Dietary Phytochemicals: Natural Swords Combating Inflammation and Oxidation-Mediated Degenerative Diseases.,"Cumulatively, degenerative disease is one of the most fatal groups of diseases, and it contributes to the mortality and poor quality of life in the world while increasing the economic burden of the sufferers. Oxidative stress and inflammation are the major pathogenic causes of degenerative diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), diabetes mellitus (DM), and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although a number of synthetic medications are used to treat these diseases, none of the current regimens are completely safe. Phytochemicals (polyphenols, carotenoids, anthocyanins, alkaloids, glycosides, saponins, and terpenes) from natural products such as dietary fruits, vegetables, and spices are potential sources of alternative medications to attenuate the oxidative stress and inflammation associated with degenerative diseases. Based on <i>in vitro</i>, <i>in vivo</i>, and clinical trials, some of these active compounds have shown good promise for development into novel agents for treating RA, DM, and CVD by targeting oxidative stress and inflammation. In this review, phytochemicals from natural products with the potential of ameliorating degenerative disease involving the bone, metabolism, and the heart are described.",Islam MA; Alam F; Solayman M; Khalil MI; Kamal MA; Gan SH,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27721914/,1,0,0,0,0,0
27677775,Liver injury from herbal and dietary supplements.,"Herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) are used increasingly both in the United States and worldwide, and HDS-induced liver injury in the United States has increased proportionally. Current challenges in the diagnosis and management of HDS-induced liver injury were the focus of a 2-day research symposium sponsored by the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease and the National Institutes of Health. HDS-induced liver injury now accounts for 20% of cases of hepatotoxicity in the United States based on research data. The major implicated agents include anabolic steroids, green tea extract, and multi-ingredient nutritional supplements. Anabolic steroids marketed as bodybuilding supplements typically induce a prolonged cholestatic but ultimately self-limiting liver injury that has a distinctive serum biochemical as well as histological phenotype. Green tea extract and many other products, in contrast, tend to cause an acute hepatitis-like injury. Currently, however, the majority of cases of HDS-associated liver injury are due to multi-ingredient nutritional supplements, and the component responsible for the toxicity is usually unknown or can only be suspected. HDS-induced liver injury presents many clinical and research challenges in diagnosis, identification of the responsible constituents, treatment, and prevention. Also important are improvements in regulatory oversight of nonprescription products to guarantee their constituents and ensure purity and safety. The confident identification of injurious ingredients within HDS will require strategic alignments among clinicians, chemists, and toxicologists. The ultimate goal should be to prohibit or more closely regulate potentially injurious ingredients and thus promote public safety.

27671819,Fisetin and Its Role in Chronic Diseases.,"Chronic inflammation is a prolonged and dysregulated immune response leading to a wide variety of physiological and pathological conditions such as neurological abnormalities, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, pulmonary diseases, immunological diseases, cancers, and other life-threatening conditions. Therefore, inhibition of persistent inflammation will reduce the risk of inflammation-associated chronic diseases. Inflammation-related chronic diseases require chronic treatment without side effects. Use of traditional medicines and restricted diet has been utilized by mankind for ages to prevent or treat several chronic diseases. Bioactive dietary agents or ""Nutraceuticals"" present in several fruits, vegetables, legumes, cereals, fibers, and certain spices have shown potential to inhibit or reverse the inflammatory responses and several chronic diseases related to chronic inflammation. Due to safe, nontoxic, and preventive benefits, the use of nutraceuticals as dietary supplements or functional foods has increased in the Western world. Fisetin (3,3',4',7-tetrahydroxyflavone) is a dietary flavonoid found in various fruits (strawberries, apples, mangoes, persimmons, kiwis, and grapes), vegetables (tomatoes, onions, and cucumbers), nuts, and wine that has shown strong anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-tumorigenic, anti-invasive, anti-angiogenic, anti-diabetic, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective effects in cell culture and in animal models relevant to human diseases. In this chapter, we discuss the beneficial pharmacological effects of fisetin against different pathological conditions with special emphasis on diseases related to chronic inflammatory conditions.",Pal HC; Pearlman RL; Afaq F,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27671819/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Nutritional supplements (NS) are complexes of nutrients with variant activity that may infer reversal to nutrient depletion. They tend to be popular amongst social categories associated with the healthy life style, such as the elite and amateur athletes, military people and the general population. An overview of the state of play with regard to nutritional supplements - natural and synthetic-, is important both from toxicological and commercial point of view. From a thorough literature review on nutritional supplements, several patents of application have been identified and herewith reviewed which recommend natural vegetable extracts as food supplements for prophylaxis, therapy, protection of immune system, diabetes, oxidative stress, cancer, chronic inflammations and other health conditions. Besides, nutritional supplements of pharmacological validity and high popularity are discussed relative to their contents and group of use. Cases of adulteration or unintentional contamination of commercial products with abusing substances (doping substances, narcotics etc.) or toxic compounds (heavy metals, plant toxics) have shed light to the problem of causing recalls of some products by the FDA.

27665301,"Does Zinc Really ""Metal"" with Diabetes? The Epidemiologic Evidence.","Zinc (Zn) is important in a number of processes related to insulin secretion and insulin activity in peripheral tissues, making this element an interesting potential co-adjuvant in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). This issue has been matter of interest in recent years. The available evidence is analyzed in this review. Information from epidemiologic studies evaluating the relationship between Zn and T2D is inconsistent. Furthermore, few studies examined the association between Zn status and insulin action and/or glucose homeostasis. In terms of usefulness of Zn as a preventive agent for T2D development, information is insufficient to reach firm conclusions. Results from Zn supplementation trials found some positive effects only in those with initial sub normal Zn status in a significant proportion of individuals. In conclusion, the effect of Zn on patients with type 2 diabetes is still an open question, and better study designs are needed to clarify the real impact and characteristics of the Zn-diabetes interaction.",Ruz M; Carrasco F; Sánchez A; Perez A; Rojas P,Current diabetes reports,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27665301/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Numerous studies have shown that sunlight exposure can provide protection to a wide variety of diseases, ranging from different types of tumors to hypertension to type 1 diabetes to multiple sclerosis. Moreover, studies have shown that avoiding sunlight may influence the initiation and progression of some of these diseases. Avoidance of sunlight, coupled with the inclination towards consuming supplements, is becoming the primary choice to obtain vitamin D. The purpose of this article is to present evidences from published literature, to show that the expected benefits of vitamin D supplements are minimized by the potential risk of cardiovascular events and beyond. Since hypovitaminosis D status usually reflects reduced sunlight exposure, the obvious primary replacement should be safe sunlight exposure, and not exogenous supplements.",Razzaque MS,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27645314/,1,0,0,0,0,0
27623982,Effect of inulin-type fructans on blood lipid profile and glucose level: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to assess the effects of inulin-type fructans (ITF) on human blood lipids and glucose homeostasis associated with metabolic abnormalities, including dyslipidemia, overweight or obesity, and type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) before January 2016. Human trials that investigated the effects of ITF supplementation on the lipid profile, fasting glucose and insulin were included using Review Manager 5.3. Twenty RCTs with 607 adult participants were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. In the overall analysis, the supplementation of ITF reduced only the low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c) (mean difference (MD): -0.15; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.29, -0.02; P=0.03) without affecting the other endpoints. Within the T2DM subgroup analysis, ITF supplementation was positively associated with a decreased fasting insulin concentration (MD: -4.01; 95% CI: -5.92, -2.09; P<0.0001) and increased high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c) (MD: 0.07; 95% CI: 0, 0.14; P=0.05). Moreover, a reduced fasting glucose tendency was identified only in the T2DM subgroup (MD: -0.42; 95% CI: -0.90, 0.06; P=0.09). There was a potential publication bias, and few trials were available for the T2DM subgroup analysis. In summary, the use of ITF may have benefits for LDL-c reduction across all study populations, whereas HDL-c improvement and glucose control were demonstrated only in the T2DM subgroup. Thus, additional, well-powered, long-term, randomized clinical trials are required for a definitive conclusion. Overall, ITF supplementation may provide a novel direction for improving the lipid profile and glucose metabolism.",Liu F; Prabhakar M; Ju J; Long H; Zhou HW,European journal of clinical nutrition,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27623982/,0,1,0,1,0,0
27619931,Supplements for Diabetes Mellitus: A Review of the Literature.,"The primary approach to controlling diabetes involves diet and lifestyle modification combined with pharmacologic interventions. Patients who are interested in exploring dietary supplements in the management of diabetes may have questions about which supplement to choose and whether any issues will arise with their current medication regimen. After reading this review, the pharmacist should be able to identify supplements that may provide benefit to improve diabetes management, understand what potential harm to the patient may occur, and be able to assist the patient in choosing high-quality supplements. This review will focus on the safety and efficacy data surrounding nicotinamide, ginseng, fenugreek, vitamin D, chromium, and cinnamon. These supplements are commonly listed in general circulation periodicals with claims to improve blood sugar management. Efficacy data showed a modest decrease in fasting plasma glucose of -0.96 mmol/dL (-17.29 mg/dL) for fenugreek and -24.59 mg/dL for cinnamon. It remains to be seen whether supplementation with these products can affect outcomes such as morbidity and mortality. Despite many studies being available, the majority lack uniformity across multiple dimensions, including varying participant characteristics, inconsistent formulations of supplement and dose, and differing study durations. This, coupled with variation in quality and purity of commercially available products, prevents universal recommendation for use in diabetes management.",Yilmaz Z; Piracha F; Anderson L; Mazzola N,Journal of pharmacy practice,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27619931/,1,0,0,0,0,0
27574584,Integrating diet and exercise into care of prostate cancer patients on androgen deprivation therapy.,"Improved diagnosis and treatment regimens have resulted in greater longevity for men with prostate cancer. This has led to an increase in both androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) use and duration of exposure, and therefore to its associated adverse effects, such as sexual dysfunction, osteoporosis, reduced muscle mass, increased fat mass, and increased incidence of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Given that the adverse effects of ADT are systemic, often debilitating, and difficult to treat, efforts continue in the development of new strategies for long-term management of prostate cancer. The PubMed database was searched to select trials, reviews, and meta-analyses in English using such search terms as ""prostate cancer"" and ""androgen deprivation therapy"", ""cardiovascular risk"", ""lean body mass"", ""exercise"", and ""diet"". The initial searches produced 379 articles with dates 2005 or more recent. Articles published after 2004 were favored. This review utilizes the latest data to provide a status update on the effects of exercise and diet on patients with prostate cancer, focusing on ADT-associated side effects, and it discusses the evidence for such interventions. Since the evidence of large-scale trials in patients with prostate cancer is missing, and an extrapolation of supporting data to all patient subgroups cannot be provided, individualized risk assessments remain necessary before the initiation of exercise and diet programs. Exercise, diet, and nutritional supplementation interventions have the potential to provide effective, accessible, and relatively inexpensive strategies for mitigating ADT-associated toxicities without introducing additional adverse effects.",Moyad MA; Newton RU; Tunn UW; Gruca D,Research and reports in urology,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27574584/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The labeling of health claims, including qualified health claims, on conventional foods and dietary supplements requires premarket approval by the FDA. Health claims characterize the relationship between a substance (food or food component) and a disease (eg, diabetes or cardiovascular disease) or a health-related condition (eg, hypertension). This review describes the FDA's evaluation of intervention and observational studies that characterize a relationship between whole grains and type 2 diabetes.

27560446,Mechanisms by which cocoa flavanols improve metabolic syndrome and related disorders.,"Dietary administration of cocoa flavanols may be an effective complementary strategy for alleviation or prevention of metabolic syndrome, particularly glucose intolerance. The complex flavanol composition of cocoa provides the ability to interact with a variety of molecules, thus allowing numerous opportunities to ameliorate metabolic diseases. These interactions likely occur primarily in the gastrointestinal tract, where native cocoa flavanol concentration is high. Flavanols may antagonize digestive enzymes and glucose transporters, causing a reduction in glucose excursion, which helps patients with metabolic disorders maintain glucose homeostasis. Unabsorbed flavanols, and ones that undergo enterohepatic recycling, will proceed to the colon where they can exert prebiotic effects on the gut microbiota. Interactions with the gut microbiota may improve gut barrier function, resulting in attenuated endotoxin absorption. Cocoa may also positively influence insulin signaling, possibly by relieving insulin-signaling pathways from oxidative stress and inflammation and/or via a heightened incretin response. The purpose of this review is to explore the mechanisms that underlie these outcomes, critically review the current body of literature related to those mechanisms, explore the implications of these mechanisms for therapeutic utility, and identify emerging or needed areas of research that could advance our understanding of the mechanisms of action and therapeutic potential of cocoa flavanols.",Strat KM; Rowley TJ; Smithson AT; Tessem JS; Hulver MW; Liu D; Davy BM; Davy KP; Neilson AP,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27560446/,1,0,0,0,0,0

There has been expanding research on the pleiotropic role of vitamin D in pregnancy and the implications of its deficiency on maternal-fetal outcomes. Several studies have associated low maternal vitamin D status to adverse outcomes in pregnancy, including preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm births, low birth weight, and others. Several randomized controlled clinical trials of Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy have also been conducted. Though some of the studies found improvement in pregnancy outcomes with vitamin D supplementation, others have not shown any association. In this article, we have critically reviewed the observational and interventional studies, published primarily within the past two years (January 2014 to February 2016) on the influence of vitamin D deficiency on pregnancy and the impact of its supplementation.

27553017,Vitamin D: not just the bone. Evidence for beneficial pleiotropic extraskeletal effects.,"Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin and a steroid hormone that plays a central role in maintaining calcium-phosphorus and bone homeostasis in close interaction with parathyroid hormone, acting on its classical target tissues, namely, bone, kidney, intestine, and parathyroid glands. However, vitamin D endocrine system regulates several genes (about 3 % of the human genome) involved in cell differentiation, cell-cycle control, and cell function and exerts noncalcemic/pleiotropic effects on extraskeletal target tissues, such as immune and cardiovascular system, pancreatic endocrine cells, muscle, and adipose tissue. Several studies have demonstrated the role of vitamin D supplementation in the prevention/treatment of various autoimmune diseases and improvement of glucose metabolism, muscle, and adipose tissue function. Hence, this review aims to elucidate the effects of vitamin D on extraskeletal target tissues and to investigate the potential therapeutic benefit of vitamin D supplementation among a broad group of pathological conditions, especially with regard to metabolic and autoimmune diseases. In addition, we focused on the best daily intakes and serum levels of vitamin D required for extraskeletal benefits which, even if still controversial, appear to be higher than those widely accepted for skeletal effects.",Caprio M; Infante M; Calanchini M; Mammi C; Fabbri A,Eating and weight disorders : EWD,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27553017/,1,0,0,0,0,0

27534632,Consequences of iodine deficiency and excess in pregnant women: an overview of current knowns and unknowns.,"Severe iodine deficiency during development results in maternal and fetal hypothyroidism and associated serious adverse health effects, including cretinism and growth retardation. Universal salt iodization is the first-line strategy for the elimination of severe iodine deficiency. Iodine supplementation is recommended for vulnerable groups in severely iodine-deficient regions where salt iodization is infeasible or insufficient. A recent clinical trial has informed best practices for iodine supplementation of severely iodine-deficient lactating mothers. Because of successful programs of universal salt iodization in formerly severely iodine-deficient regions around the world, public health concern has shifted toward mild to moderate iodine deficiency, which remains prevalent in many regions, especially among pregnant women. Observational studies have shown associations between both mild maternal iodine deficiency and mild maternal thyroid hypofunction and decreased child cognition. Iodine supplementation has been shown to improve indexes of maternal thyroid function, even in marginally iodine-deficient areas. However, no data are yet available from randomized controlled trials in regions of mild to moderate iodine insufficiency on the relation between maternal iodine supplementation and neurobehavioral development in the offspring; thus, the long-term benefits and safety of such supplementation are uncertain. Although it is clear that excessive iodine intake can cause alterations in thyroid function in susceptible individuals, safe upper limits for iodine intake in pregnancy have not been well defined. Well-designed, prospective, randomized controlled trials that examine the effects of iodine supplementation on maternal thyroid function and infant neurobehavioral development in mildly to moderately iodine-deficient pregnant women are urgently needed. In addition, clinical data on the effects of iodine excess in pregnant and lactating women are needed to inform current recommendations for safe upper limits on chronic iodine ingestion in general and on iodine supplementation in particular.",Pearce EN; Lazarus JH; Moreno-Reyes R; Zimmermann MB,The American journal of clinical nutrition,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27534632/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Thus, we aimed to investigate the effect of oral Mg supplementation on glucose and insulin-sensitivity parameters in participants with diabetes or at high risk of diabetes compared with placebo. A literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Clinicaltrials.gov without language restriction, was undertaken. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of oral Mg supplementation vs placebo in patients with diabetes or at high risk of diabetes. Standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used for summarizing outcomes with at least two studies; other outcomes were summarized descriptively. Eighteen RCTs (12 in people with diabetes and 6 in people at high risk of diabetes) were included.

27527213,Natural Phyto-Bioactive Compounds for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes: Inflammation as a Target.,"Diabetes is a metabolic, endocrine disorder which is characterized by hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance due to insulin resistance. Extensive research has confirmed that inflammation is closely involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications. Patients with diabetes display typical features of an inflammatory process characterized by the presence of cytokines, immune cell infiltration, impaired function and tissue destruction. Numerous anti-diabetic drugs are often prescribed to diabetic patients, to reduce the risk of diabetes through modulation of inflammation. However, those anti-diabetic drugs are often not successful as a result of side effects; therefore, researchers are searching for efficient natural therapeutic targets with less or no side effects.

We evaluated the effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on insulin resistance in women with PCOS in a meta-analysis. Literature searches of MEDLINE, PubMed Central and EMBASE for publications in English were conducted up to December 2015. We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated effects of omega-3 fatty acids supplements on insulin resistance in women with PCOS. Results are summarized as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Effect sizes of eligible studies were pooled using random-effects models (the DerSimonian-Laird estimator).

27481154,Vitamin D and Vitamin D from Ultraviolet-Irradiated Mushrooms (Review).,"Vitamin D may have an important role in many aspects of human health, from bone fractures to prostate cancer, cardiovascular disease, neuromuscular problems, and diabetes. Vitamin D is produced in the human body by the skin after sunlight absorption, but as human lifestyles change, so does the time of exposure to sunlight, necessitating dietary supplementation of vitamin D. Mushrooms have the advantages that they are the only source of vitamin D in the produce aisle and they are one of the few nonfortified food sources. Here, we review the current literature on enhancement of the vitamin D content in mushrooms and literature evidence on the bioavailability of vitamin D in humans and animals after ingesting ultraviolet (UV)-irradiated mushrooms. We also present available literature on health safety after UV irradiation of mushrooms, and we discuss issues arising in the attempt to incorporate UV irradiation into the mushroom production line.",Kamweru PK; Tindibale EL,International journal of medicinal mushrooms,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27481154/,1,0,0,0,0,0
27457213,"Vitamins B1, B2, B3 and B9 - Occurrence, Biosynthesis Pathways and Functions in Human Nutrition.","Vitamins are chemical compounds whose derivatives are involved in vital metabolic pathways of all living organisms. The complete endogenous biosynthesis of vitamins can be performed by many bacteria, yeast and plants, but humans need to acquire most of these essential nutrients with food. In recent years, new types of action of the well-recognized vitamins or their more sophisticated relationships have been reported. In this review we present the current knowledge of factors that can influence the yield and regulation of vitamin B1, B2, B3 and B9 biosynthesis in plants which can be important for human nutrition. A summary of modern methods applied for vitamin analysis in biological materials is also provided. Contributions of selected vitamins to the homeostasis of the human organism, as well as their relations to the progress or prevention of some important diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and Alzheimer's disease are discussed in the light of recent investigations. Better understanding of the mechanisms of vitamin uptake by human tissues and possible metabolic or genetic backgrounds of vitamin deficiencies can open new perspectives on the medical strategies and biotechnological processes of food fortification.",Wolak N; Zawrotniak M; Gogol M; Kozik A; Rapala-Kozik M,Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27457213/,1,0,0,0,0,0
27455317,"Potassium Intake, Bioavailability, Hypertension, and Glucose Control.","Potassium is an essential nutrient. It is the most abundant cation in intracellular fluid where it plays a key role in maintaining cell function. The gradient of potassium across the cell membrane determines cellular membrane potential, which is maintained in large part by the ubiquitous ion channel the sodium-potassium (Na+-K+) ATPase pump. Approximately 90% of potassium consumed (60-100 mEq) is lost in the urine, with the other 10% excreted in the stool, and a very small amount lost in sweat. Little is known about the bioavailability of potassium, especially from dietary sources. Less is understood on how bioavailability may affect health outcomes. Hypertension (HTN) is the leading cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and a major financial burden ($50.6 billion) to the US public health system, and has a significant impact on all-cause morbidity and mortality worldwide. The relationship between increased potassium supplementation and a decrease in HTN is relatively well understood, but the effect of increased potassium intake from dietary sources on blood pressure overall is less clear. In addition, treatment options for hypertensive individuals (e.g., thiazide diuretics) may further compound chronic disease risk via impairments in potassium utilization and glucose control. Understanding potassium bioavailability from various sources may help to reveal how specific compounds and tissues influence potassium movement, and further the understanding of its role in health.",Stone MS; Martyn L; Weaver CM,Nutrients,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27455317/,1,0,0,0,0,0
27448716,Reducing the burden of obesity-associated cancers with anti-inflammatory long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.,"Today's world population has an unprecedented risk of dying from the consequences of being overweight and obese. Chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer are often accelerated because of excessive adiposity. Various biological mechanisms are implicated in the obesity-cancer link, particularly local and systemic inflammation as well as altered growth factor signaling pathways. In order to combat obesity-induced inflammation and the resulting increases in cancer risk and progression, the identification of safe and effective mechanism-based interventions is imperative. Notably, long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) modulate the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, prostaglandins and other inflammatory mediators, restore insulin sensitivity, and can prevent or delay tumorigenesis. Delineating the precise mechanisms by which omega-3 PUFAs suppress obesity-induced inflammation will help identify promising key mechanistic targets and intervention strategies to break the obesity-cancer link.",Khatib SA; Rossi EL; Bowers LW; Hursting SD,Prostaglandins & other lipid mediators,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27448716/,1,0,0,0,0,0
27448057,Skeletal muscle mitochondria as a target to prevent or treat type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Low levels of physical activity and the presence of obesity are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction has been associated with the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Although the evidence for a causal relationship between mitochondrial function and insulin resistance is still weak, emerging evidence indicates that boosting mitochondrial function might be beneficial to patient health. Exercise training is probably the most recognized promoter of mitochondrial function and insulin sensitivity and hence is still regarded as the best strategy to prevent and treat T2DM. Animal data, however, have revealed several new insights into the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism, and novel targets for interventions to boost mitochondrial function have emerged. Importantly, many of these targets seem to be regulated by factors such as nutrition, ambient temperature and circadian rhythms, which provides a basis for nonpharmacological strategies to prevent or treat T2DM in humans. Here, we will review the current evidence that mitochondrial function can be targeted therapeutically to improve insulin sensitivity and to prevent T2DM, focusing mainly on human intervention studies.",Hesselink MK; Schrauwen-Hinderling V; Schrauwen P,Nature reviews.

27445320,Magnesium in pregnancy.,"Magnesium deficiency is prevalent in women of childbearing age in both developing and developed countries. The need for magnesium increases during pregnancy, and the majority of pregnant women likely do not meet this increased need. Magnesium deficiency or insufficiency during pregnancy may pose a health risk for both the mother and the newborn, with implications that may extend into adulthood of the offspring. The measurement of serum magnesium is the most widely used method for determining magnesium levels, but it has significant limitations that have both hindered the assessment of deficiency and affected the reliability of studies in pregnant women. Thus far, limited studies have suggested links between magnesium inadequacy and certain conditions in pregnancy associated with high mortality and morbidity, such as gestational diabetes, preterm labor, preeclampsia, and small for gestational age or intrauterine growth restriction. This review provides recommendations for further study and improved testing using measurement of red cell magnesium. Pregnant women should be counseled to increase their intake of magnesium-rich foods such as nuts, seeds, beans, and leafy greens and/or to supplement with magnesium at a safe level.",Dalton LM; Ní Fhloinn DM; Gaydadzhieva GT; Mazurkiewicz OM; Leeson H; Wright CP,Nutrition reviews,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27445320/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Therefore, thinking of mere dependence on the sun to meet vitamin D requirements under the existing set of conditions is erroneous. Pakistan as a developing economy of South Asia and a region spanning latitude 24° 35' North and longitude 61° East to 78° East, gravely suffers from increased VDD among pregnant women, neonates, infants, children, adolescents, adults, and the elderly people despite its abundant sunshine. Multiple indicators inflating VDD have been widely reported such as food habits, sociocultural and religious taboos, restricted sun exposure, unavailability of fortified diets, age, season, gender, lack of vitamin D supplementation, skin pigmentation and genetic factors. Strategies entailing mandatory food fortification, pragmatic implementation of vitamin D supplementation program, developing awareness on health damaging effects of the syndrome and sagacious sun exposure in tandem with global support to incline the government, program managers and consumers, need to be followed. Concerted efforts are further required to scale up the surveillance and monitoring of the magnitude of VDD by taking NGOs, industry, academia and health sector into loop to devise remedies for VDD in Pakistan.",Akhtar S,Pakistan journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27393445/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We performed a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials until 28 January 2016. A total of five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 415 participants were included. Compared with the controls, aloe vera supplementation significantly reduced the concentrations of fasting blood glucose (FBG) (p = 0.02; weighed mean difference [WMD]: -30.05 mg/dL; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -54.87 to -5.23 mg/dL), glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (p < 0.00001; WMD: -0.41%; 95% CI: -0.55% to -0.27%), triglyceride (p = 0.0001), total cholesterol (TC) (p < 0.00001), and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) (p < 0.00001). Aloe vera was superior to placebo in increasing serum high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (p = 0.04). Only one adverse event was reported. The evidence from RCTs showed that aloe vera might effectively reduce the levels of FBG, HbA1c, triglyceride, TC and LDL-C, and increase the levels of HDL-C on prediabetes and early non-treated diabetic patients. Limited evidence exists about the safety of aloe vera. Given the small number and poor quality of RCTs included in the meta-analysis, these results are inconclusive.

27339886,Gestational diabetes mellitus: does an effective prevention strategy exist?,"The overall incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing worldwide. Preventing pathological hyperglycaemia during pregnancy could have several benefits: a reduction in the immediate adverse outcomes during pregnancy, a reduced risk of long-term sequelae and a decrease in the economic burden to healthcare systems. In this Review we examine the evidence supporting lifestyle modification strategies in women with and without risk factors for GDM, and the efficacy of dietary supplementation and pharmacological approaches to prevent this disease. A high degree of heterogeneity exists between trials so a generalised recommendation is problematic. In population studies of dietary or combined lifestyle measures, risk of developing GDM is not improved and those involving a physical activity intervention have yielded conflicting results. In pregnant women with obesity, dietary modification might reduce fetal macrosomia but in these patients, low compliance and no significant reduction in the incidence of GDM has been observed in trials investigating physical activity. Supplementation with probiotics or myoinositol have reduced the incidence of GDM but confirmatory studies are still needed. In randomized controlled trials, metformin does not prevent GDM in certain at-risk groups. Given the considerable potential for reducing disease burden, further research is needed to identify strategies that can be easily and effectively implemented on a population level.",Agha-Jaffar R; Oliver N; Johnston D; Robinson S,Nature reviews.

27329332,A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials on the effects of magnesium supplementation on insulin sensitivity and glucose control.,"A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of oral magnesium supplementation on insulin sensitivity and glucose control in both diabetic and non-diabetic individuals. PubMed-Medline, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases were searched (from inception to November 25, 2015) to identify RCTs evaluating the effect of magnesium on insulin sensitivity and glucose control. A random-effects model and generic inverse variance method were used to compensate for the heterogeneity of studies. Publication bias, sensitivity analysis, and meta-regression assessments were conducted using standard methods. The impact of magnesium supplementation on plasma concentrations of glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin, and HOMA-IR index was assessed in 22, 14, 12 and 10 treatment arms, respectively. A significant effect of magnesium supplementation was observed on HOMA-IR index (WMD: -0.67, 95% CI: -1.20, -0.14, p=0.013) but not on plasma glucose (WMD: -0.20mmol/L, 95% CI: -0.45, 0.05, p=0.119), HbA1c (WMD: 0.018mmol/L, 95% CI: -0.10, 0.13, p=0.756), and insulin (WMD: -2.22mmol/L, 95% CI: -9.62, 5.17, p=0.556). A subgroup analysis comparing magnesium supplementation durations of <4 months versus ≥4 months, exhibited a significant difference for fasting glucose concentrations (p<0.001) and HOMA-IR (p=0.001) in favor of the latter subgroup. Magnesium supplementation for ≥4 months significantly improves the HOMA-IR index and fasting glucose, in both diabetic and non-diabetic subjects.

27324558,"Inositol, neural tube closure and the prevention of neural tube defects.","Susceptibility to neural tube defects (NTDs), such as anencephaly and spina bifida is influenced by genetic and environmental factors including maternal nutrition. Maternal periconceptional supplementation with folic acid significantly reduces the risk of an NTD-affected pregnancy, but does not prevent all NTDs, and ""folic acid non-responsive"" NTDs continue to occur. Similarly, among mouse models of NTDs, some are responsive to folic acid but others are not. Among nutritional factors, inositol deficiency causes cranial NTDs in mice while supplemental inositol prevents spinal and cranial NTDs in the curly tail (Grhl3 hypomorph) mouse, rodent models of hyperglycemia or induced diabetes, and in a folate-deficiency induced NTD model. NTDs also occur in mice lacking expression of certain inositol kinases. Inositol-containing phospholipids (phosphoinositides) and soluble inositol phosphates mediate a range of functions, including intracellular signaling, interaction with cytoskeletal proteins, and regulation of membrane identity in trafficking and cell division. Myo-inositol has been trialed in humans for a range of conditions and appears safe for use in human pregnancy. In pilot studies in Italy and the United Kingdom, women took inositol together with folic acid preconceptionally, after one or more previous NTD-affected pregnancies. In nonrandomized cohorts and a randomized double-blind study in the United Kingdom, no recurrent NTDs were observed among 52 pregnancies reported to date. Larger-scale fully powered trials are needed to determine whether supplementation with inositol and folic acid would more effectively prevent NTDs than folic acid alone.

Established vitamin D effects are renal and intestinal resorption of calcium and phosphate for optimal bone mineral density; however, the widespread distribution of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a member of the nuclear steroid hormone receptor family, provides extensive evidence for additional pleiotropic effects of the vitamin D ligand. Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are common and were reported as risk factors for a variety of diseases in observational studies. In addition, extensive research from experimental studies also illustrated extraskeletal effects of vitamin D. More randomized controlled trials are ongoing to test the effects of high dose vitamin D supplementation in numerous chronic diseases. This article summarizes the current state of knowledge regarding effects on muscle, on glucose metabolism in type 2 diabetes mellitus and on cardiovascular risk factors and diseases. Furthermore, we discuss the influence of vitamin D on the immune system, whereby vitamin D might provide beneficial effects not only for infectious but also for autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes mellitus.

A comprehensive examination of the past 16 years of study within the field provided a distillation of key data. Both in animal and human studies, creatine supplementation together with exercise training demonstrated greater beneficial effects on glucose metabolism; creatine supplementation itself demonstrated positive results in only a few of the studies. In the animal studies, the effects of creatine supplementation on glucose metabolism were even more distinct, and caution is needed in extrapolating these data to different species, especially to humans. Regarding human studies, considering the samples characteristics, the findings cannot be extrapolated to patients who have poorer glycemic control, are older, are on a different pharmacological treatment (e.g., exogenous insulin therapy) or are physically inactive. Thus, creatine supplementation is a possible nutritional therapy adjuvant with hypoglycemic effects, particularly when used in conjunction with exercise.",Pinto CL; Botelho PB; Pimentel GD; Campos-Ferraz PL; Mota JF,Amino acids,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27306768/,0,1,0,0,0,0

Subsequently, there has been a wealth of new research. The aim of this work was to systematically review the evidence for the role of diet in the management of IBS and to update the guidelines. Twelve questions relating to diet and IBS were defined based on review of the previous guideline questions, current evidence and clinical practice. Chosen topics were on healthy eating and lifestyle (alcohol, caffeine, spicy food, elimination diets, fat and fluid intakes and dietary habits), milk and dairy, dietary fibre, fermentable carbohydrates, gluten, probiotics and elimination diets/food hypersensitivity. Data sources were CINAHL, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Medline, Scopus and Web of Science up to October 2015. Studies were assessed independently in duplicate using risk of bias tools specific to each included study based on inclusion and exclusion criteria for each question. National Health and Medical Research Council grading evidence levels were used to develop evidence statements and recommendations, in accordance with Practice-based Evidence in Nutrition Global protocol used by the BDA. Eighty-six studies were critically appraised to generate 46 evidence statements, 15 clinical recommendations and four research recommendations.

These compounds, when combined with pharmaceutical drugs, show improved efficacy and safety in preclinical and clinical studies of epilepsy, neuropathic pain, osteoarthritis, depression, schizophrenia, diabetes and cancer. Their additional clinical benefits include reducing levels of TNFα and other inflammatory cytokines. We describe how pleiotropic natural products can be developed as bioactive incentives within the network pharmacology together with pharmaceutical drugs and self-care interventions. Since approximately 50% of chronically-ill patients do not take pharmaceutical drugs as prescribed, psychobehavioral incentives may appeal to patients at risk for medication non-adherence. For epilepsy, the incentive-based network therapy comprises anticonvulsant drugs, antiseizure natural products (n-3 PUFA, curcumin or/and resveratrol) coupled with disease-specific behavioral interventions delivered by mobile medical apps. The add-on combination of antiseizure natural products and mHealth supports patient empowerment and intrinsic motivation by having a choice in self-care behaviors. The incentivized therapies offer opportunities: (1) to improve clinical efficacy and safety of existing drugs, (2) to catalyze patient-centered, disease self-management and behavior-changing habits, also improving health-related quality-of-life after reaching remission, and (3) merging copyrighted mHealth software with natural products, thus establishing an intellectual property protection of medical treatments comprising the natural products existing in public domain and currently promoted as dietary supplements.

This narrative review examines the efficacy of chromium supplements for improving glycemic control as measured by decreases in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Using systematic search criteria, 20 randomized controlled trials of chromium supplementation in T2DM patients were identified. Clinically meaningful treatment goals were defined as an FPG of ≤7.2 mmol/dL, a decline in HbA1c to ≤7%, or a decrease of ≥0.5% in HbA1c. In only a few randomized controlled trials did FPG (5 of 20), HbA1c (3 of 14), or both (1 of 14) reach the treatment goals with chromium supplementation. HbA1c declined by ≥0.5% in 5 of 14 studies. On the basis of the low strength of existing evidence, chromium supplements have limited effectiveness, and there is little rationale to recommend their use for glycemic control in patients with existing T2DM.

Data from placebo-controlled trials are more conflicting. The aim of this study is to systematically review and meta-analyze available observational and register studies reporting data on body composition in studies on TS in TDS. An extensive MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane search was performed including the following words: ""testosterone"" and ""body composition."" All observational studies comparing the effect of TS on body weight and other body composition and metabolic endpoints were considered. Out of 824 retrieved articles, 32 were included in the study enrolling 4513 patients (mean age 51.7 ± 6.1 years). TS was associated with a time-dependent reduction in body weight and waist circumference (WC). The estimated weight loss and WC reduction at 24 months were -3.50 [-5.21; -1.80] kg and -6.23 [-7.94; -4.76] cm, respectively. TS was also associated with a significant reduction in fat and with an increase in lean mass as well as with a reduction in fasting glycemia and insulin resistance.

27150288,Dietary supplements and disease prevention - a global overview.,"Dietary supplements are widely used and offer the potential to improve health if appropriately targeted to those in need. Inadequate nutrition and micronutrient deficiencies are prevalent conditions that adversely affect global health. Although improvements in diet quality are essential to address these issues, dietary supplements and/or food fortification could help meet requirements for individuals at risk of deficiencies. For example, supplementation with vitamin A and iron in developing countries, where women of reproductive age, infants and children often have deficiencies; with folic acid among women of reproductive age and during pregnancy; with vitamin D among infants and children; and with calcium and vitamin D to ensure bone health among adults aged ≥65 years. Intense debate surrounds the benefits of individual high-dose micronutrient supplementation among well-nourished individuals because the alleged beneficial effects on chronic diseases are not consistently supported. Daily low-dose multivitamin supplementation has been linked to reductions in the incidence of cancer and cataracts, especially among men. Baseline nutrition is an important consideration in supplementation that is likely to modify its effects. Here, we provide a detailed summary of dietary supplements and health outcomes in both developing and developed countries to help guide decisions about dietary supplement recommendations.",Rautiainen S; Manson JE; Lichtenstein AH; Sesso HD,Nature reviews.

27146016,Iron Regulation of Pancreatic Beta-Cell Functions and Oxidative Stress.,"Dietary advice is the cornerstone in first-line treatment of metabolic diseases. Nutritional interventions directed at these clinical conditions mainly aim to (a) improve insulin resistance by reducing energy-dense macronutrient intake to obtain weight loss and (b) reduce fluctuations in insulin secretion through avoidance of rapidly absorbable carbohydrates. However, even in the majority of motivated patients selected for clinical trials, massive efforts using this approach have failed to achieve lasting efficacy. Less attention has been given to the role of micronutrients in metabolic diseases. Here, we review the evidence that highlights (a) the importance of iron in pancreatic beta-cell function and dysfunction in diabetes and (b) the integrative pathophysiological effects of tissue iron levels in the interactions among the beta cell, gut microbiome, hypothalamus, innate and adaptive immune systems, and insulin-sensitive tissues. We propose that clinical trials are warranted to clarify the impact of dietary or pharmacological iron reduction on the development of metabolic disorders.",Backe MB; Moen IW; Ellervik C; Hansen JB; Mandrup-Poulsen T,Annual review of nutrition,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27146016/,1,0,0,0,0,0
27146015,Citrus Flavonoids as Regulators of Lipoprotein Metabolism and Atherosclerosis.,"Citrus flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds with significant biological properties. This review summarizes recent advances in understanding the ability of citrus flavonoids to modulate lipid metabolism, other metabolic parameters related to the metabolic syndrome, and atherosclerosis. Citrus flavonoids, including naringenin, hesperitin, nobiletin, and tangeretin, have emerged as potential therapeutics for the treatment of metabolic dysregulation. Epidemiological studies reveal an association between the intake of citrus flavonoid-containing foods and a decreased incidence of cardiovascular disease. Studies in cell culture and animal models, as well as a limited number of clinical studies, reveal the lipid-lowering, insulin-sensitizing, antihypertensive, and anti-inflammatory properties of citrus flavonoids. In animal models, supplementation of rodent diets with citrus flavonoids prevents hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance primarily through inhibition of hepatic fatty acid synthesis and increased fatty acid oxidation. Citrus flavonoids blunt the inflammatory response in metabolically important tissues including liver, adipose, kidney, and the aorta. The mechanisms underlying flavonoid-induced metabolic regulation have not been completely established, although several potential targets have been identified. In mouse models, citrus flavonoids show marked suppression of atherogenesis through improved metabolic parameters as well as through direct impact on the vessel wall. Recent studies support a role for citrus flavonoids in the treatment of dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, obesity, and atherosclerosis. Larger human studies examining dose, bioavailability, efficacy, and safety are required to promote the development of these promising therapeutic agents.",Mulvihill EE; Burke AC; Huff MW,Annual review of nutrition,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27146015/,1,0,0,0,0,0
27133809,"Beneficial role of vitamin K supplementation on insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism, and the reduced risk of type 2 diabetes: A review.","Micronutrients are gaining acceptance as an important nutritional therapy for the prevention and/or management of diabetes and its associated health risks. Although a very small quantity of micronutrients are required for specific functions in our bodies, moderate deficiencies can lead to serious health issues. Impaired insulin sensitivity and glucose intolerance play a major role in the development of diabetic pathophysiology. Vitamin K is well known for its function in blood coagulation. Moreover, several human studies reported the beneficial role of vitamin K supplementation in improving insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, preventing insulin resistance, and reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2 D). Both animal and human studies have suggested that vitamin K-dependent protein (osteocalcin [OC]), regulation of adipokine levels, antiinflammatory properties, and lipid-lowering effects may mediate the beneficial function of vitamin K in insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. This review for the first time provides an overview of the currently available preclinical and clinical evidences on the effect of vitamin K supplementation in the management of insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. The outcome of this review will increase understanding for the development of a novel adjuvant therapy to achieve better control of glycemia and improve the lives of diabetic patients.",Manna P; Kalita J,"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27133809/,1,0,0,0,0,0

To summarize current evidence and standards, recommendations, guidelines, and regulations on nutrition or supplements in lactating women with emphasis placed on long-term health effects in offspring, including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, overweight/obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, or glucose intolerance. Medline, Embase, selected databases and websites were searched for documents published between 2010 and 2015. Thirteen documents met the inclusion criteria. Effects of maternal long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) supplementation on overweight/obesity or hypertension in offspring were assessed in 10 studies. One study described the effect of maternal vitamin D supplementation on overweight/obesity, and the remaining 2 studies assessed the effects of maternal probiotic/synbiotic supplementation during lactation on overweight/obesity or metabolic syndrome in their infants. Forty-one documents contained dietary recommendations on various macro- and micronutrients for lactating women, but without consideration of our long-term health outcomes in infants. Literature on nutrition of lactating women and its effect on their infants' later health with respect to metabolic programming outcomes appeared to be scarce, and focused mostly on supplementation of LC-PUFA's. No recent guidelines or recommendations were available, highlighting the significant research gaps regarding this topic.",de Waard M; Brands B; Kouwenhoven SMP; Lerma JC; Crespo-Escobar P; Koletzko B; Zalewski BM; van Goudoever JB,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27128857/,0,1,0,0,0,0
27052013,Lifestyle and Dietary Interventions in the Management of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.,"NAFLD is the leading cause of chronic liver disease in the Western world with an estimated prevalence of 20-30 %. Lifestyle interventions targeted at weight loss through dietary interventions and exercise are the most effective treatment, but only a minority of patients are able to achieve and sustain the necessary intervention targets. Weight loss of 3-5 % has been associated with a reduction of hepatic steatosis while weight loss of ≥5-7 % has correlated with resolution of NASH in some studies. Greater reductions in weight loss (≥10 %) may improve hepatic fibrosis. In the absence of weight loss, no specific diet has demonstrated superiority. Physical activity can improve hepatic steatosis and metabolic indices even without weight loss. Diet coupled with exercise can produce significant weight loss and may improve histologic components of the NAFLD activity score. While formal guidelines for diet and exercise in NAFLD are lacking, adherence to diet and exercise recommendations similar to those from the American Diabetes Association for diabetic care seems reasonable. Dietary supplementation with vitamin E in non-diabetics with biopsy-proven NASH has been shown to improve NAFLD activity score. The role for other macronutrients, micronutrients, antioxidants, and probiotics in the treatment of NAFLD remains limited.",Hannah WN; Harrison SA,Digestive diseases and sciences,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27052013/,1,0,0,0,0,0
27046048,Buckwheat phenolic metabolites in health and disease.,"Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench, F. tataricum Gaertner) groats and flour have been established globally as nutritional foods because of their high levels of proteins, polyphenols and minerals. In some regions, buckwheat herb is used as a functional food. In the present study, reports of in vitro studies, preclinical and clinical trials dealing with the effect of buckwheat and its metabolites were reviewed. There are numerous reports of potential health benefits of consuming buckwheat, which may be in the form of food, dietary supplements, home remedies or possibly pharmaceutical drugs; however, adverse effects, including those resulting from contamination, must be considered. There are reports of antioxidative activity of buckwheat, which contains high levels of rutin and quercetin. On the other hand, both cytotoxic and antigenotoxic effects have been shown. Reduction of hyperlipidaemia, reduction of blood pressure and improved weight regulation have been suggested. Consuming buckwheat may have a beneficial effect on diabetes, since lower postprandial blood glucose and insulin response have been reported. In addition, buckwheat metabolites, such as rutin, may have intrinsic protective effects in preserving insulin signalling. Rutin has also been suggested to have potential therapeutic applications for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The literature indicates that buckwheat is safe to consume and may have various beneficial effects on human health.",Kreft M,Nutrition research reviews,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27046048/,1,0,0,0,0,0
27033506,Nutraceuticals as Lipid-Lowering Treatment in Pregnancy and Their Effects on the Metabolic Syndrome.,"Maternal nutrition and lifestyle before and during pregnancy influence both mother and offspring's health and can be correlated with the metabolic syndrome in later life. Findings from animal and human studies indicate that nutrition during pregnancy has an important role in microbiological, metabolic, physiologic and immunologic development and homeostasis. A low nutritional intake in early pregnancy may represent a risk for adverse effects during pregnancy as well as on birth outcome. It seems that dietary supplementation with probiotics in perinatal period may represent safe and practical approach in dealing with the most common adverse pregnancy outcomes such as obesity and gestational diabetes. The SPRING (Study of Probiotics in the prevention of Gestational diabetes) will give important answers about potential benefits of probiotics in pregnant women who are obese and overweight and otherwise at the high risk for complications during pregnancy. Fish oil supplementation during the last trimester of pregnancy showed no effects on plasma lipids and lipoproteins in offspring, as well as on their adiposity. The effect of hypercholesterolemia during pregnancy on both mothers and child needs to be further investigated as it could have a biological role. The guidelines for the eventual clinical approach currently do not exist. Potential benefits of nutraceuticals on several metabolic parameters have been suggested. Limited evidence does not allow to draw final conclusions on preventive health strategies and dietary patterns that should be promoted during pregnancy. Further prospective and intervention studies are needed to establish it.

27020528,Effects of vitamin D on serum lipid profile in patients with type 2 diabetes: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"The effect of vitamin D on lipid profile in type 2 diabetic patients is controversial. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the effect of vitamin D on serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) of these patients to elucidate the subject. Seven databases were searched and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessed the effect of vitamin D on lipid profile published until November 2015 were identified. Un-standardized mean difference and its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated from the effect sizes by using random effects model. We found 2220 articles in our systematic search, after exclusion of un-related studies we enrolled 17 studies comparing intervention group (received vitamin D) with control group (received placebo) in the meta-analysis. Vitamin D significantly reduced serum TC (-3.74 mg/dl, 95% CI: -7.13 to -0.34, P = 0.031), but serum TG did not show significant reduction (-4.90 mg/dl, 95% CI: -15.11-5.31, P = 0.347). Results confirmed the significant lowering effect of vitamin D on LDL in patients with T2D (-2.55 mg/dl, 95% CI: -4.83 to -0.26, P = 0.029), but change in serum HDL was negligible (-0.72 mg/dl, 95% CI: -1.27 to -0.17, P = 0.010). Subgroup analyses showed that the baseline serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D of patients, vitamin D dosage, intervention duration, and the method of vitamin D application influence the effect of vitamin D on lipid markers. This study demonstrated that vitamin D improved serum levels of TC, TG, and LDL in patients with T2D but changes of serum HDL was not satisfactory.",Jafari T; Fallah AA; Barani A,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27020528/,0,0,0,1,0,0

Mechanistic studies showed that these TAs act as hypoglycemic and antiobesity agents mainly through (i) reducing the absorption of glucose; (ii) decreasing endogenous glucose production; (iii) increasing insulin sensitivity; (iv) improving lipid homeostasis; and (v) promoting body weight regulation. Besides these promising beneficial effects, it is believed that OA, UA, and BA protect against diabetes-related comorbidities due to their antiatherogenic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. We also highlight the protective effect of OA, UA, and BA against oxidative damage, which may be very relevant for the treatment and/or prevention of T2DM. In the present review, we provide an integrative description of the antidiabetic properties of OA, UA, and BA, evaluating the potential use of these TAs as food supplements or pharmaceutical agents to prevent and/or treat T2DM.",Silva FS; Oliveira PJ; Duarte MF,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27012451/,1,0,0,0,0,0
27009076,Vitamin D and airway infections: a European perspective.,"Vitamin D has immuno-modulatory properties, and deficient levels of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (<30 nmol/l) may contribute to increased risk of infectious illnesses. This narrative review summarises data on vitamin D status in Europe and updates results of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) regarding vitamin D and airway infections such as tuberculosis (TB) and acute upper respiratory tract infection. In Europe, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is up to 37% in the general population and up to 80% in nursing home residents and non-European immigrants. Half of TB patients have a migration background. While results of RCTs do not support the concept of beneficial adjunctive effects of vitamin D supplements in anti-TB treatment [odds ratio (OR) = 0.86; 95% CI 0.62-1.19], the few published RCTs on the prophylaxis of TB suggest some protective vitamin D effects in individuals with deficient circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Regarding acute respiratory tract infection, RCTs indicate a significant risk reduction by vitamin D supplements [OR = 0.65; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50-0.85]. There is evidence that daily administration is more effective than high-dose bolus administration [OR = 0.48 (95% CI 0.30-0.77) vs. OR = 0.87 (95% CI 0.67-1.14)] and that individuals with deficient or insufficient (30-50 nmol/l) circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels benefit most. Several vitamin D effects on innate immunity may explain these protective effects. In summary, there is possible evidence from RCTs for protective vitamin D effects on TB and likely evidence for protective effects on acute airway infection. Since vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in Europe, especially in institutionalised individuals and non-European immigrants, daily oral vitamin D intake, e.g. 1000 international units, is an inexpensive measure to ensure adequate vitamin D status in individuals at risk.",Zittermann A; Pilz S; Hoffmann H; März W,European journal of medical research,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27009076/,1,0,0,0,0,0
27005745,Statin-related myotoxicity.,"Statin therapy has a very important role in decreasing cardiovascular risk, and treatment non-compliance may therefore be a concern in high cardiovascular risk patients. Myotoxicity is a frequent side effect of statin therapy and one of the main causes of statin discontinuation, which limits effective treatment of patients at risk of or with cardiovascular disease. Because of the high proportion of patients on statin treatment and the frequency of statin-related myotoxicity, this is a subject of concern in clinical practice. However, statin-related myotoxicity is probably underestimated because there is not a gold standard definition, and its diagnosis is challenging. Moreover, information about pathophysiology and optimal therapeutic options is scarce. Therefore, this paper reviews the knowledge about the definition, pathophysiology and predisposing conditions, diagnosis and management of statin-related myotoxicity, and provides a practical scheme for its management in clinical practice.",Fernandes V; Santos MJ; Pérez A,Endocrinologia y nutricion : organo de la Sociedad Espanola de Endocrinologia y Nutricion,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27005745/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The purpose of this study was to outline evidence on the effects of soy protein supplementation on clinical indices in T2D and MS subjects by performing a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases up to March 2015 for RCTs. Pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by the fixed-and-random-effects model. A total of eleven studies with eleven clinical variables met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis showed that fasting plasma glucose (FPG) [weighted mean difference (WMD), -0.207; 95% CI, -0.374 to -0.040; p=0.015], fasting serum insulin (FSI) (WMD, -0.292; 95% CI, -0.496 to -0.088; p=0.005), homeostasis model of assessment for insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) (WMD, -0.346; 95% CI, -0.570 to -0.123; p=0.002), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (WMD, -0.230; 95% CI, -0.441 to -0.019; p=0.033), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (WMD, -0.304; 95% CI, -0.461 to -0.148; p=0.000), total cholesterol (TC) (WMD, -0.386; 95% CI, -0.548 to -0.225; p=0.000), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (WMD, -0.510; 95% CI, -0.722 to -0.299; p=0.000) are significant reduced with soy protein supplementation, compared with a placebo control group, in T2D and MS patients. Furthermore, soy protein supplementation for longer duration (≥6 mo) significantly reduced FPG, LDL-C, and CRP, while that for a shorter duration (<6 mo) significantly reduced FSI and HOMA-IR.

They represent major public health threat to our society. Increasing prevalence of obesity and T2DM contributes to escalating morbidity and mortality from CVD and stroke. Carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine) is a dipeptide with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-glycation, anti-ischaemic and chelating roles and is available as an over-the-counter food supplement. Animal evidence suggests that carnosine may offer many promising therapeutic benefits for multiple chronic diseases due to these properties. Carnosine, traditionally used in exercise physiology to increase exercise performance, has potential preventative and therapeutic benefits in obesity, insulin resistance, T2DM and diabetic microvascular and macrovascular complications (CVD and stroke) as well as number of neurological and mental health conditions.

26974893,Potential of Food and Natural Products to Promote Endothelial and Vascular Health.,"Endothelial dysfunction is now well established as a pivotal early event in the development of major cardiovascular diseases including hypertension, atherosclerosis, and diabetes. The alteration of the endothelial function is often triggered by an imbalance between the endothelial formation of vasoprotective factors including nitric oxide (NO) and endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization, and an increased level of oxidative stress involving several prooxidant enzymes such as NADPH oxidase and, often also, the appearance of cyclooxygenase-derived vasoconstrictors. Preclinical studies have indicated that polyphenol-rich food and food-derived products such as grape-derived products, black and red berries, green and black teas and cocoa, and omega-3 fatty acids can trigger activating pathways in endothelial cells promoting an increased formation of nitric oxide and endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization. Moreover, intake of such food-derived products has been associated with the prevention and/or the improvement of an established endothelial dysfunction in several experimental models of cardiovascular diseases and in humans with cardiovascular diseases. This review will discuss both experimental and clinical evidences indicating that different types of food and natural products are able to promote endothelial and vascular health, as well as the underlying mechanisms.",Auger C; Said A; Nguyen PN; Chabert P; Idris-Khodja N; Schini-Kerth VB,Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26974893/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Articles were selected for inclusion if they represented primary data or review articles published between 1980 and 2015 in high-impact journals. The normal kidney has the capacity to tightly regulate K(+) homoeostasis. We discuss new findings with respect to sensing mechanisms by which the kidney maintains K(+) homeostasis in the gastrointestinal tract and distal tubule. There are widely prescribed hypertensive medications that cause hyperkalemia and thus require dietary K(+) restriction. We conclude by discussing newly approved drugs capable of binding K(+) in the gastrointestinal tract and speculate that this new pharmacology might allow diet liberalization in patients at risk for hyperkalemia, affording them the numerous benefits of a K(+)-rich diet.",Palmer BF; Clegg DJ,Mayo Clinic proceedings,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26948054/,1,0,0,0,0,0
26919772,Multiple micronutrient supplementation and birth outcomes: The potential importance of selenium.,"A healthy diet and lifestyle is a pre requisite to a healthy pregnancy, however this is often not the case. Many pregnant women are overweight or clinically obese and this has been shown to increase their risk of major complications of pregnancy such a preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation, preterm birth and gestational diabetes. An adequate and balanced diet is important, as is the balance between macronutrients such as carbohydrates, fats and protein and the vitamins and essential trace elements needed to support metabolism. In this review, we look at the use of micronutrient supplements during pregnancy and examine the recommendations currently in place to guide the use of these products. We also present evidence that broad-spectrum micronutrients may have a beneficial effect in pregnancy and lower the incidence of preeclampsia and preterm labour, especially in overweight and obese women. Finally we focus on the essential trace element Selenium and present a strong case for its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function during oxidative stress which is generated in the placentae of women experiencing these complications of pregnancy. It can no longer be assumed that women are consuming an adequate and well balanced diet during pregnancy and the use of micronutrient supplements may potentially have positive effects on a healthy start to life.

26902507,Effects of vitamin D on blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Previous studies have suggested that vitamin D supplementation may decrease blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes, although conflicting results have been reported. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of the vitamin D supplementation on blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes. A meta-analysis of published randomized controlled trials was conducted. Eligible studies were identified via a literature search of the MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases through to May 25, 2015. The endpoint of the analysis was the change in blood pressure due to vitamin D treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes. These changes were calculated as the difference between the baseline and final measurements performed in each study. A fixed-effects model was used to calculate the combined effect estimates; in the presence of heterogeneity, a random-effects model was used. A total of 15 articles were included in the meta-analysis. All 15 articles, including 1,134 patients with type 2 diabetes, were analyzed for systolic blood pressure (SBP), and 13 articles, including 793 patients, were analyzed for diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The combined-effect estimate of vitamin D intervention on SBP was -0.121 mmHg (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.355 to 0.113, p = 0.311), and considerable heterogeneity was observed between studies (p < 0.001, I(2)= 74.2%). For DBP, the combined effect estimate was -0.160 mmHg (95% CI -0.298 to -0.022, p = 0.023), and no heterigenieity was observed (p = 0.673, I(2) = 0.0%). This study is the first meta-analysis of the effect of vitamin D supplementation on blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes. This meta-analysis demonstrated that vitamin D supplementation may result in a reduction in DBP in patients with type 2 diabetes.

All randomised-controlled trials published in English in multiple databases from January 2000 to June 2015 were systematically searched. Only studies that addressed glucose- and glycaemic-related factors as outcome variables were included. The main outcomes of interest in trials were mean changes in glucose, HbA1c, insulin and homoeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale to assess the quality of studies, a total of eleven studies with 614 subjects were included. The pooled mean difference and effect size with a 95% CI were extracted using a random-effect model. It was found that there are statistically significant pooled mean differences between the probiotics and the placebo-controlled groups on the reduction of glucose (-0·52 mmol/l, 95% CI -0·92, -0·11 mmol/l; P=0·01) and HbA1c (-0·32%, 95% CI -0·57, -0·07%; P=0·01). There was no statistically significant pooled mean difference between the probiotics and the placebo-controlled groups on the reduction of insulin (-0·48 µIU/ml, 95% CI -1·34, 0·38 µIU/ml; P=0·27) and HOMA-IR (pooled effect of -0·44, 95% CI -1·57, 0·70; P=0·45). Meta-regression analysis identified that probiotics had significant effects on reduction of glucose, HbA1c, insulin and HOMA-IR in participants with diabetes, but not in participants with other risk factors.

26881023,Lycopene Deficiency in Ageing and Cardiovascular Disease.,"Lycopene is a hydrocarbon phytochemical belonging to the tetraterpene carotenoid family and is found in red fruit and vegetables. Eleven conjugated double bonds predetermine the antioxidant properties of lycopene and its ability to scavenge lipid peroxyl radicals, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide. Lycopene has a low bioavailability rate and appears in the blood circulation incorporated into chylomicrons and other apo-B containing lipoproteins. The recent body of evidence suggests that plasma concentration of lycopene is not only a function of intestinal absorption rate but also lycopene breakdown via enzymatic and oxidative pathways in blood and tissues. Oxidative stress and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide may represent a major cause of lycopene depletion in ageing, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. It has been shown recently that low carotenoid levels, and especially decreased serum lycopene levels, are strongly predictive of all-cause mortality and poor outcomes of cardiovascular disease. However, there is a poor statistical association between dietary and serum lycopene levels which occurs due to limited bioavailability of lycopene from dietary sources. Hence, it is very unlikely that nutritional intervention alone could be instrumental in the correction of lycopene and carotenoid deficiency. Therefore, new nutraceutical formulations of carotenoids with enhanced bioavailability are urgently needed.",Petyaev IM,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26881023/,1,0,0,0,0,0
26877200,Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy: Updated meta-analysis on maternal outcomes.,"Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent during pregnancy. It has been suggested that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy may reduce the risk of adverse gestational outcomes. To update a previous meta-analysis on the effects of oral vitamin D supplementation (alone or in combination with other vitamins and minerals) during pregnancy on maternal 25(OH)D levels and risk of developing pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, impaired glucose tolerance, caesarean section, gestational hypertension and other adverse conditions. We searched for randomized and quasi-randomized trials through the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations, and direct communications with relevant organizations. Assessments of inclusion criteria, extraction of data from included studies, and risk of bias' assessments of the included studies were done independently by two review authors. We included 15 trials, excluded 27 trials and 23 trials are still ongoing/unpublished. Data from seven trials with 868 women suggest that pregnant women supplemented with vitamin D had significantly higher 25(OH)D levels compared to controls (mean difference: 54.7nmol/L; 95% CI 36.6, 72.9). Two trials found a lower risk of preeclampsia (8.9% versus 15.5%; average risk ratio 0.52; 95% CI 0.25, 1.05) and two other trials found no difference in the risk of gestational diabetes with vitamin D supplementation. Also, three trials found that supplementation with vitamin D plus calcium reduced the risk of pre-eclampsia (5% versus 9%; average risk ratio 0.51; 95% CI 0.32, 0.80). Supplementing pregnant women with vitamin D led to significantly higher levels of 25(OH)D at term compared to placebo/control but results were inconsistent. Vitamin D supplementation, with or without calcium, may be related to lower risk of preeclampsia but more studies are needed to confirm this.",Palacios C; De-Regil LM; Lombardo LK; Peña-Rosas JP,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26877200/,1,0,0,1,0,0
26861388,Selenium and Metabolic Disorders: An Emphasis on Type 2 Diabetes Risk.,"Selenium (Se) is a micronutrient that maintains biological functions through the action of Se containing proteins known as selenoproteins. Due to the known antioxidant effects of Se, supplements containing Se have been on the rise. While Se supplementation may be beneficial for Se deficient populations, few are at risk for Se deficiency due to the transportation of food from Se-rich regions and the rise of Se-enriched foods. Alarmingly, Se supplementation may have adverse effects in people who already receive an adequate Se supply. Specifically, an increased risk of type 2 diabetes has been reported in individuals with high baseline Se levels. However, this effect was restricted to males, suggesting the relationship between Se and glucose homeostasis may be sexually dimorphic. This review will discuss the current understanding of the interaction between Se and glucose homeostasis, including any sex differences that have been described.",Ogawa-Wong AN; Berry MJ; Seale LA,Nutrients,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26861388/,1,0,0,0,0,0

It plays a relevant role in regulating cellular metabolism, preserving cellular energy homeostasis, and is involved in many other cellular processes as well as metabolic ones, including cell cycle regulation and endothelial and vascular relaxation. Recently, the effects of naturally occurring compounds able to prevent and treat diseases through AMPK activation have attracted the attention of many researchers. Among such compounds, flavonoids found in natural sources, like quercetin, genistein, epigallocatechins, resveratrol, have been proposed as AMPK activators. This review summarizes and updates the most recent findings concerning the mechanisms through which different dietary compounds, from plant foods, affect the AMPK pathway in healthy and pathological in vitro and in vivo models, paying particular attention to molecular mechanisms involved in diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease and cancer.",Gasparrini M; Giampieri F; Alvarez Suarez J M; Mazzoni L; Y Forbes Hernandez T; Quiles JL; Bullon P; Battino M,Current drug targets,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26844571/,1,0,0,0,0,0
26805016,Hypovitaminosis D in bariatric surgery: A systematic review of observational studies.,"Obesity is a public health problem that carries global and substantial social and economic burden. Relative to non-surgical interventions, bariatric surgery has the most substantial and lasting impact on weight loss. However, it leads to a number of nutritional deficiencies requiring long term supplementation. The aims of this paper are to review 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] status pre and post bariatric surgery, describe the dose response of vitamin D supplementation, and assess the effect of the surgical procedure on 25(OH)D level following supplementation. We searched Medline, PubMed, the Cochrane Library and EMBASE, for relevant observational studies published in English, from 2000 to April 2015. The identified references were reviewed, in duplicate and independently, by two reviewers. We identified 51 eligible observational studies assessing 25(OH)D status pre and/or post bariatric surgery. Mean pre-surgery 25(OH)D level was below 30ng/ml in 29 studies, and 17 of these studies showed mean 25(OH)D levels ≤20ng/ml. Mean 25(OH)D levels remained below 30ng/ml following bariatric surgery, despite various vitamin D replacement regimens, with only few exceptions. The increase in post-operative 25(OH)D levels tended to parallel increments in vitamin D supplementation dose but varied widely across studies. An increase in 25(OH)D level by 9-13ng/ml was achieved when vitamin D deficiency was corrected using vitamin D replacement doses of 1100-7100IU/day, in addition to the usual maintenance equivalent daily dose of 400-2000IU (total equivalent daily dose 1500-9100IU). There was no difference in mean 25(OH)D level following supplementation between malabsorptive/combination procedures and restrictive procedures. Hypovitaminosisis D persists in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery, despite various vitamin D supplementation regimens. Further research is needed to determine the optimal vitamin D dose to reach desirable 25(OH)D levels in this population, and to demonstrate whether this dose varies according to the surgical procedure.",Chakhtoura MT; Nakhoul NN; Shawwa K; Mantzoros C; El Hajj Fuleihan GA,Metabolism: clinical and experimental,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26805016/,0,1,0,1,0,0
26786971,Cardiovascular benefits of probiotics: a review of experimental and clinical studies.,"The microbiota inhabiting the human gastro-intestinal tract is reported to have a significant impact on the health of an individual. Recent findings suggest that the microbial imbalance of the gut may play a role in pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Therefore, several studies have delved into the aspect of altering gut microbiota with probiotics as an approach to prevent and/or treat CVD. The World Health Organization defines probiotics as live microorganisms that, when consumed in adequate amounts, have a positive influence on the individual's health. The present review focuses on strategies of human dietary intervention with probiotic strains and their impact on cardiovascular risk factors like hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, obesity and type-2 diabetes. Accumulating evidence shows probiotics to lower low density lipoproteins (LDL)-cholesterol and improve the LDL/high density lipoproteins (HDL) ratio, as well as lower blood pressure, inflammatory mediators, blood glucose levels and body mass index. Thus, probiotics have the scope to be developed as dietary supplements with potential cardiovascular health benefits. However, there is not only ambiguity regarding the exact strains and dosages of the probiotics that will bring about positive health effects, but also factors like immunity and genetics of the individual that might influence the efficacy of probiotics. Therefore, further studies are required not only to understand the mechanisms by which probiotics may beneficially affect the cardiovascular system, but also to rule out any of their probable negative effects on health. The present review aims to critically appraise the complexity of the available data with regard to the cardiovascular benefits of probiotics.",Thushara RM; Gangadaran S; Solati Z; Moghadasian MH,Food & function,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26786971/,1,0,0,0,0,0
26778479,Role of phytochemicals in the management of metabolic syndrome.,"The World Health Organization (WHO) for some years has been focusing on what is now commonly referred to as an ""epidemic of obesity and diabetes"" (""diabesity""): behind this outbreak, there are several risk factors grouped in what is called ""metabolic syndrome"" (MetS). The basis of this ""epidemic"" is either a diet too often characterized by excessive consumption of saturated and trans-esterified fatty acids, simple sugars and salt, either a sedentary lifestyle. The aim of this review is to focus on the phytochemicals that have a more positive effect on the treatment and/or prevention of MetS. Treatment strategies for MetS include pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic options, with varying degrees of success rate. The first is indicated for patients with high cardiovascular risk, while the second one is the most cost-effective preventive approach for subjects with borderline parameters and for patients intolerant to pharmacological therapy. MetS non-pharmacological treatments could involve the use of nutraceuticals, most of which has plant origins (phytochemicals), associated with lifestyle improvement. The chapter will discuss the available evidence on soluble fibres from psyllium and other sources, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid and other cinnamon phytochemicals, berberine, corosolic acid from banaba, charantin from bitter gourd, catechins and flavonols from green tea and cocoa. Vegetable omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, alliin from garlic, soy peptides, and curcumin from curcuma longa.

26762372,The effects of lutein on cardiometabolic health across the life course: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The antioxidant lutein is suggested as being beneficial to cardiometabolic health because of its protective effect against oxidative stress, but evidence has not systematically been evaluated. We aimed to evaluate systematically the effects of lutein (intake or concentrations) on cardiometabolic outcomes in different life stages. This is a systematic review with meta-analysis of literature published in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar up to August 2014. Included were trials and cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies in which the association between lutein concentrations, dietary intake, or supplements and cardiometabolic outcomes was reported. Two independent investigators reviewed the articles. Seventy-one relevant articles were identified that included a total of 387,569 participants. Only 1 article investigated the effects of lutein during pregnancy, and 3 studied lutein in children. Furthermore, 31 longitudinal, 33 cross-sectional, and 3 intervention studies were conducted in adults. Meta-analysis showed a lower risk of coronary heart disease (pooled RR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.98) and stroke (pooled RR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.93) for the highest compared with the lowest tertile of lutein blood concentration or intake. There was no significant association with type 2 diabetes mellitus (pooled RR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.77, 1.22), but higher lutein was associated with a lower risk of metabolic syndrome (pooled RR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.92) for the highest compared with the lowest tertile. The literature on risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases showed that lutein might be beneficial for atherosclerosis and inflammatory markers, but there were inconsistent associations with blood pressure, adiposity, insulin resistance, and blood lipids. Our findings suggest that higher dietary intake and higher blood concentrations of lutein are generally associated with better cardiometabolic health. However, evidence mainly comes from observational studies in adults, whereas large-scale intervention studies and studies of lutein during pregnancy and childhood are scarce.",Leermakers ET; Darweesh SK; Baena CP; Moreira EM; Melo van Lent D; Tielemans MJ; Muka T; Vitezova A; Chowdhury R; Bramer WM; Kiefte-de Jong JC; Felix JF; Franco OH,The American journal of clinical nutrition,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26762372/,0,1,0,1,0,1
26757838,The effects of nutritional interventions on recurrence in survivors of colorectal adenomas and cancer: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials.,"Nutrition and dietary supplementation may modulate outcomes in colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors. However, no recent systematic review has focused on randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The aim of this systematic review was to examine the effects of nutritional RCTs in survivors of colorectal adenomas and cancer. Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library were searched to identify research between April 2006 and January 2014. The primary outcomes were colorectal adenoma and cancer recurrence. Each included study was assessed for risk of bias. A meta-analysis using a random-effects model was performed, in which two or more RCTs investigated the same dietary intervention. Eight completed RCTs, all in colorectal adenoma survivors, were identified, with four investigating the effect of folic acid. A meta-analysis of the four folic acid RCTs showed no statistically significant effect of folic acid on colorectal adenoma recurrence (relative risks=0.93; 95% confidence interval: 0.69, 1.25). The impact of the remaining completed RCTs, investigating antioxidant supplementation, green tea extract, prebiotic fibre and phytooestrogens/insoluble fibre, could not be reliably estimated because of the limited number and heterogeneity of the interventions. In addition, three heterogeneous ongoing RCTs were identified, investigating green tea (n=1) and eicosapentaenoic acid (n=1) in colorectal adenoma survivors and dietary modifications (n=1) in CRC survivors in remission. Overall, this systematic review highlights the need for further research, especially in CRC survivors, as we identified no completed and only one ongoing RCT in this population.",van Dijk M; Pot GK,European journal of clinical nutrition,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26757838/,0,1,0,1,0,0
26755885,Chemoprevention of obesity-related liver carcinogenesis by using pharmaceutical and nutraceutical agents.,"Obesity and its related metabolic disorders are serious health problems worldwide, and lead to various health-related complications, including cancer. Among human cancers, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies affected by obesity. Therefore, obesity and its related disorders might be a key target for the prevention of HCC. Recently, new research indicates that the molecular abnormalities associated with obesity, including insulin resistance/hyperinsulinemia, chronic inflammation, adipokine imbalance, and oxidative stress, are possible molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of obesity-related hepatocarcinogenesis. Green tea catechins and branched-chain amino acids, both of which are classified as nutraceutical agents, have been reported to prevent obesity-related HCC development by improving metabolic abnormalities. The administration of acyclic retinoid, a pharmaceutical agent, reduced the incidence of HCC in obese and diabetic mice, and was also associated with improvements in insulin resistance and chronic inflammation. In this article, we review the detailed molecular mechanisms that link obesity to the development of HCC in obese individuals. We also summarize recent evidence from experimental and clinical studies using either nutraceutical or pharmaceutical agents, and suggest that nutraceutical and pharmaceutical approaches targeting metabolic abnormalities might be a promising strategy to prevent the development of obesity-related HCC.",Sakai H; Shirakami Y; Shimizu M,World journal of gastroenterology,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26755885/,1,0,0,0,0,0
26746178,"Dietary and Policy Priorities for Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, and Obesity: A Comprehensive Review.","Suboptimal nutrition is a leading cause of poor health. Nutrition and policy science have advanced rapidly, creating confusion yet also providing powerful opportunities to reduce the adverse health and economic impacts of poor diets. This review considers the history, new evidence, controversies, and corresponding lessons for modern dietary and policy priorities for cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. Major identified themes include the importance of evaluating the full diversity of diet-related risk pathways, not only blood lipids or obesity; focusing on foods and overall diet patterns, rather than single isolated nutrients; recognizing the complex influences of different foods on long-term weight regulation, rather than simply counting calories; and characterizing and implementing evidence-based strategies, including policy approaches, for lifestyle change. Evidence-informed dietary priorities include increased fruits, nonstarchy vegetables, nuts, legumes, fish, vegetable oils, yogurt, and minimally processed whole grains; and fewer red meats, processed (eg, sodium-preserved) meats, and foods rich in refined grains, starch, added sugars, salt, and trans fat. More investigation is needed on the cardiometabolic effects of phenolics, dairy fat, probiotics, fermentation, coffee, tea, cocoa, eggs, specific vegetable and tropical oils, vitamin D, individual fatty acids, and diet-microbiome interactions. Little evidence to date supports the cardiometabolic relevance of other popular priorities: eg, local, organic, grass-fed, farmed/wild, or non-genetically modified. Evidence-based personalized nutrition appears to depend more on nongenetic characteristics (eg, physical activity, abdominal adiposity, gender, socioeconomic status, culture) than genetic factors. Food choices must be strongly supported by clinical behavior change efforts, health systems reforms, novel technologies, and robust policy strategies targeting economic incentives, schools and workplaces, neighborhood environments, and the food system. Scientific advances provide crucial new insights on optimal targets and best practices to reduce the burdens of diet-related cardiometabolic diseases.",Mozaffarian D,Circulation,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26746178/,1,0,0,0,0,0
26696633,Hypomagnesemia in Type 2 Diabetes: A Vicious Circle?,"Over the past decades, hypomagnesemia (serum Mg(2+) <0.7 mmol/L) has been strongly associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Patients with hypomagnesemia show a more rapid disease progression and have an increased risk for diabetes complications. Clinical studies demonstrate that T2DM patients with hypomagnesemia have reduced pancreatic β-cell activity and are more insulin resistant. Moreover, dietary Mg(2+) supplementation for patients with T2DM improves glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Intracellular Mg(2+) regulates glucokinase, KATP channels, and L-type Ca(2+) channels in pancreatic β-cells, preceding insulin secretion. Moreover, insulin receptor autophosphorylation is dependent on intracellular Mg(2+) concentrations, making Mg(2+) a direct factor in the development of insulin resistance. Conversely, insulin is an important regulator of Mg(2+) homeostasis. In the kidney, insulin activates the renal Mg(2+) channel transient receptor potential melastatin type 6 that determines the final urinary Mg(2+) excretion. Consequently, patients with T2DM and hypomagnesemia enter a vicious circle in which hypomagnesemia causes insulin resistance and insulin resistance reduces serum Mg(2+) concentrations. This Perspective provides a systematic overview of the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of Mg(2+) on insulin secretion and insulin signaling. In addition to providing a review of current knowledge, we provide novel directions for future research and identify previously neglected contributors to hypomagnesemia in T2DM.",Gommers LM; Hoenderop JG; Bindels RJ; de Baaij JH,Diabetes,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26696633/,1,0,0,0,0,0

26671914,[Dual action of vitamin C versus degradation and supplementation].,"The article discusses vitamin C from the point of view of its supplementation with food and in the form of oral supplements. The dual action of vitamin C is connected with the presence of oxygen, which may reduce the amount of the vitamin in food products, influence thermal resistance, cause degradation and show an antioxidation effect. Vitamin C stimulates the immune cells and collagen synthesis. It may protect the LDL fraction against oxidation, and therefore it is interesting for cosmetology, rheumatology, immunology and dietetics. The latest research with respect to vitamin C proved that it has the ability to dissolve neurotoxic senile plaques. Equally effective in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease is the oxidised form of vitamin C, i.e. dehydroascorbic acid. Vitamin C may be used in a combined vitamin E supplementation to avoid the pro-oxidative effect and reduce the risk of diabetes mellitus type 2 complications. In the review there is a description of the types of vitamin C degradation depending on a specific factor such as pH, temperature, oxygen, enzyme and the impact of diet on the quantity of the supplied vitamin. The literature data confirmed the positive influence of vitamin C as an addition to food. The last part of the article presents the methods of vitamin C protection used in food processing technology and of determining its content in food products. Additionally, the article describes the problems related to vitamin C oxidation processes during food processing and storage. The presented research results indicate that an adequate diet contains a sufficient amount of vitamin C for healthy people. In the case of chronic patients it is better to use supplementation.",Kaliś K,Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26671914/,1,0,0,0,0,0

It is uncertain whether a similar association exists for gestational diabetes mellitus. The aim of this systematic review was to conduct a cohort study examining first trimester body iron stores and subsequent risk of gestational diabetes, and to include these findings in a systematic review of all studies examining the association between maternal iron status, iron intake (dietary and supplemental) and the risk of gestational diabetes. Serum samples from women with first trimester screening were linked to birth and hospital records for data on maternal characteristics and gestational diabetes diagnosis. Blood was analysed for ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor and C-reactive protein. Associations between iron biomarkers and gestational diabetes were assessed using multivariate logistic regression. A systematic review and meta-analysis, registered with PROSPERO (CRD42014013663) included studies of all designs published in English from January 1995 to July 2015 that examined the association between iron and gestational diabetes and included an appropriate comparison group. Of 3776 women, 3.4% subsequently developed gestational diabetes. Adjusted analyses found increased odds of gestational diabetes for ferritin (OR 1.41; 95% CI 1.11, 1.78), but not for soluble transferrin receptor (OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.97, 1.03) per unit increase of the biomarker.

26598823,Role of Exercise and Nutrition in the Prevention of Sarcopenia.,"The age-associated loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength (sarcopenia) has been shown to increase the risk of injury due to falls and incidence of metabolic complications including insulin resistance and diabetes, which subsequently becomes a significant factor to disability among the elderly population. Nutrient intake is the most important anabolic stimulus for skeletal muscle. Specifically, the amino acid leucine and meal-induced insulin both independently stimulate muscle protein synthesis. However, age-specific changes in muscle anabolic responses to leucine become apparent when sub-maximal amounts of amino acids are administered in older subjects. Furthermore, insulin resistance of muscle protein metabolism with aging has been demonstrated in healthy non-diabetic older subjects. Resistance exercise is another anabolic stimulus which increases myofibrillar muscle protein synthesis in both young and older individuals. The increased muscle anabolism is apparent within 2-3 h after a single bout of heavy resistance exercise and remains elevated up to 2 d following the exercise. The mTOR signaling pathway in skeletal muscle is associated with an increased rate of muscle protein synthesis during the early recovery phase following a bout of resistance exercise. Finally, recent evidence on the cumulative effect of resistance exercise in combination with nutritional supplement on muscle protein metabolism will be discussed to propose a possible preventative measure against sarcopenia.",Makanae Y; Fujita S,Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26598823/,1,0,0,0,0,0

From laboratory experiments to clinical practice.,"The role of polyphenols in the cardiovascular diseases prevention is still a matter of scientific discussion. However, recent clinical studies indicate that intake of anthocyanins and in a lesser extent procyanidins can participate in prevention of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Fruits of Aronia melanocarpa (chokeberry) are known to be a reach source of these polyphenols. Moreover, its extracts were shown to express strong antioxidant, antiinflammatory, vasorelaxant and antithrombotic properties.

26527511,Effect of low-fat diet interventions versus other diet interventions on long-term weight change in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The effectiveness of low-fat diets for long-term weight loss has been debated for decades, with many randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and recent reviews giving mixed results. We aimed to summarise the large body of evidence from RCTs to determine whether low-fat diets contribute to greater weight loss than participants' usual diet, low-carbohydrate diets, and other higher-fat dietary interventions. We did a systematic review and random effects meta-analysis of RCTs comparing the long-term effect (≥1 year) of low-fat and higher-fat dietary interventions on weight loss by searching MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews to identify eligible trials published from database inception up until July 31, 2014. We excluded trials if one intervention group included a non-dietary weight loss component but the other did not, and trials of dietary supplements or meal replacement drink interventions. Data including the main outcome measure of mean difference in weight change between interventions, and whether interventions were intended to lead to weight loss, weight maintenance, or neither, were extracted from published reports. We estimated the pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) with a DerSimonian and Laird random effects method. 3517 citations were identified by the search and 53 studies met our inclusion criteria, including 68 128 participants (69 comparisons). In weight loss trials, low-carbohydrate interventions led to significantly greater weight loss than did low-fat interventions (18 comparisons; WMD 1·15 kg [95% CI 0·52 to 1·79]; I(2)=10%). Low-fat interventions did not lead to differences in weight change compared with other higher-fat weight loss interventions (19 comparisons; WMD 0·36 kg [-0·66 to 1·37; I(2)=82%), and led to a greater weight decrease only when compared with a usual diet (eight comparisons; -5·41 kg [-7·29 to -3·54]; I(2)=68%). Similarly, results of non-weight-loss trials and weight maintenance trials, for which no low-carbohydrate comparisons were made, showed that low-fat versus higher-fat interventions have a similar effect on weight loss, and that low-fat interventions led to greater weight loss only when compared with usual diet. In weight loss trials, higher-fat weight loss interventions led to significantly greater weight loss than low-fat interventions when groups differed by more than 5% of calories obtained from fat at follow-up (18 comparisons; WMD 1·04 kg [95% CI 0·06 to 2·03]; I(2)=78%), and when the difference in serum triglycerides between the two interventions at follow-up was at least 0·06 mmol/L (17 comparisons; 1·38 kg [0·50 to 2·25]; I(2)=62%). These findings suggest that the long-term effect of low-fat diet intervention on bodyweight depends on the intensity of the intervention in the comparison group. When compared with dietary interventions of similar intensity, evidence from RCTs does not support low-fat diets over other dietary interventions for long-term weight loss.

26510958,"Effect of Vitamin D or Activated Vitamin D on Circulating 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D Concentrations: A Systematic Review and Metaanalysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.","Evidence is accumulating that circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] concentrations are inversely related to overall mortality. We searched PubMed, Embase and ISI Web of Science for randomized controlled trials with a control group receiving a placebo instead of vitamin D/activated vitamin D and performed a metaanalysis to evaluate the effect of oral vitamin D/activated vitamin D on circulating 1,25(OH)2D concentrations using a random effects model. We included 52 vitamin D intervention groups (4796 individuals) and 14 intervention groups with activated vitamin D (668 individuals). Vitamin D supplements increased circulating 1,25(OH)2D by 12.2 pmol/L (95% CI, 7.8-16.5 pmol/L) and 18.8 pmol/L (95% CI, 9.2-28.4 pmol/L) if only studies with a low risk of bias in study design and reporting were considered (n = 18). There was significant heterogeneity among studies (Cohran's Q P < 0.001, I(2) = 91%). The incremental effect was larger in studies using vitamin D alone compared with coadministration of calcium supplements (18.6 pmol/L; 95% CI, 12.7-24.4 pmol/L vs 4.9 pmol/L; 95% CI, -0.4 to 10.2 pmol/L; P = 0.001), and if quantification was performed with RIA vs other methods (17.1 pmol/L; 95% CI, 11.1-23.1 pmol/L vs 6.9 pmol/L; 95% CI, 1.0-12.8 pmol/L; P = 0.02). Activated vitamin D increased the mean circulating 1,25(OH)2D by 20.5 pmol/L (95% CI, 8.3-32.7 pmol/L; P = 0.04). Again, there was evidence for significant heterogeneity among studies (Cochran Q = 85.4; P < 0.001; I(2) = 87%), but subgroup analysis did not identify parameters significantly influencing the increment in 1,25(OH)2D concentrations. Both vitamin D and activated vitamin D significantly increase circulating 1,25(OH)2D concentrations, but in vitamin D users this increase is suppressed by calcium coadministration.",Zittermann A; Ernst JB; Birschmann I; Dittrich M,Clinical chemistry,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26510958/,0,1,0,1,0,0
26510847,Calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and risk of fractures: an updated meta-analysis from the National Osteoporosis Foundation.,"The aim was to meta-analyze randomized controlled trials of calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and fracture prevention. Meta-analysis showed a significant 15 % reduced risk of total fractures (summary relative risk estimate [SRRE], 0.85; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0.73-0.98) and a 30 % reduced risk of hip fractures (SRRE, 0.70; 95 % CI, 0.56-0.87). Calcium plus vitamin D supplementation has been widely recommended to prevent osteoporosis and subsequent fractures; however, considerable controversy exists regarding the association of such supplementation and fracture risk. The aim was to conduct a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [RCTs] of calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and fracture prevention in adults. A PubMed literature search was conducted for the period from July 1, 2011 through July 31, 2015. RCTs reporting the effect of calcium plus vitamin D supplementation on fracture incidence were selected from English-language studies. Qualitative and quantitative information was extracted; random-effects meta-analyses were conducted to generate summary relative risk estimates (SRREs) for total and hip fractures. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q test and the I (2) statistic, and potential for publication bias was assessed. Of the citations retrieved, eight studies including 30,970 participants met criteria for inclusion in the primary analysis, reporting 195 hip fractures and 2231 total fractures. Meta-analysis of all studies showed that calcium plus vitamin D supplementation produced a statistically significant 15 % reduced risk of total fractures (SRRE, 0.85; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0.73-0.98) and a 30 % reduced risk of hip fractures (SRRE, 0.70; 95 % CI, 0.56-0.87). Numerous sensitivity and subgroup analyses produced similar summary associations. A limitation is that this study utilized data from subgroup analysis of the Women's Health Initiative.

26503192,Early life nutritional programming of health and disease in The Gambia.,"Exposures during the early life (periconceptional, prenatal and early postnatal) period are increasingly recognized as playing an important role in the aetiology of chronic non-communicable diseases (NCD), including coronary heart disease, stroke, hypertension, Type 2 diabetes and osteoporosis. The 'Developmental Origins of Health and Disease' (DOHaD) hypothesis states that these disorders originate through unbalanced nutrition early in life and risk is highest when there is a 'mismatch' between the early- and later-life environments. Thus, the DOHaD hypothesis would predict highest risk in countries where an excess of infants are born with low birth weight and where there is a rapid transition to nutritional adequacy or excess in adulthood. Here, I will review data from work conducted in rural Gambia, West Africa. Using demographic data dating back to the 1940s, the follow-up of randomized controlled trials of nutritional supplementation in pregnancy and the 'experiment of nature' that seasonality in this region provides, we have investigated the DOHaD hypothesis in a population with high rates of maternal and infant under-nutrition, a high burden from infectious disease, and an emerging risk of NCDs.",Moore SE,Journal of developmental origins of health and disease,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26503192/,1,0,0,0,0,1

Both subject headings and free texts were adopted. The methodological quality of the included studies were assessed and pooled analyzed by the methods recommended by the Cochrane collaboration.A total of 5 trials containing 513 participants were included. There was a significant reduction in aspects of gestational diabetes incidence (risk ratio [RR], 0.29; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.19-0.44), birth weight (mean difference [MD], -116.98; 95% CI, -208.87 to -25.09), fasting glucose oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (MD, -0.36; 95% CI, -0.51 to -0.21), 1-h glucose OGTT (MD, -0.63; 95% CI, -1.01 to -0.26), 2-h glucose OGTT (MD, -0.45; 95% CI, -0.75 to -0.16), and related complications (odds ratio [OR], 0.28; 95% CI 0.14-0.58).On the basis of current evidence, myo-inositol supplementation reduces the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), although this conclusion requires further evaluation in large-scale, multicenter, blinded randomized controlled trials.",Zheng X; Liu Z; Zhang Y; Lin Y; Song J; Zheng L; Lin S,Medicine,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26496267/,0,0,0,1,0,0
26479950,Role of vitamin D in cytotoxic T lymphocyte immunity to pathogens and cancer.,"The discovery of vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression in immune cells has opened up a new area of research into immunoregulation by vitamin D, a niche that is distinct from its classical role in skeletal health. Today, about three decades since this discovery, numerous cellular and molecular targets of vitamin D in the immune system have been delineated. Moreover, strong clinical associations between vitamin D status and the incidence/severity of many immune-regulated disorders (e.g. infectious diseases, cancers and autoimmunity) have prompted the idea of using vitamin D supplementation to manipulate disease outcome. While much is known about the effects of vitamin D on innate immune responses and helper T (T(H)) cell immunity, there has been relatively limited progress on the frontier of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immunity--an arm of host cellular adaptive immunity that is crucial for the control of such intracellular pathogens as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis (TB), malaria, and hepatitis C virus (HCV). In this review, we discuss the strong historical and clinical link between vitamin D and infectious diseases that involves cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immunity, present our current understanding as well as critical knowledge gaps in the realm of vitamin D regulation of host CTL responses, and highlight potential regulatory connections between vitamin D and effector and memory CD8 T cell differentiation events during infections.",Sarkar S; Hewison M; Studzinski GP; Li YC; Kalia V,Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26479950/,1,0,0,0,0,0
26437429,Vitamin D Deficiency Increases the Risk of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies.,"The results investigating the relationship between vitamin D levels and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are inconsistent. Thus, we focused on evaluating the association of vitamin D deficiency with GDM by conducting a meta-analysis of observed studies. A systematic literature search was conducted via PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane library to identify eligible studies before August 2015. The meta-analysis of 20 studies including 9209 participants showed that women with vitamin D deficiency experienced a significantly increased risk for developing GDM (odds ratio (OR) = 1.53; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.33, 1.75) with a little heterogeneity (I² = 16.20%, p = 0.252). A noteworthy decrease of 4.93 nmol/L (95% CI, -6.73, -3.14) in serum 25(OH)D was demonstrated in the participants with GDM, and moderate heterogeneity was observed (I² = 61.40%, p = 0.001). Subgroup analysis with study design showed that there were obvious heterogeneities in nested case-control studies (I² > 52.5%, p < 0.07). Sensitivity analysis showed that exclusion of any single study did not materially alter the overall combined effect. In summary, the evidence from this meta-analysis indicates a consistent association between vitamin D deficiency and an increased risk of GDM. However, well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to elicit the clear effect of vitamin D supplementation on prevention of GDM.",Zhang MX; Pan GT; Guo JF; Li BY; Qin LQ; Zhang ZL,Nutrients,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26437429/,1,0,0,1,0,0

Our goal was to systematically evaluate the effects of omega-3 on glucose control and lipid levels. Medline, Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Embase, the National Research Register, and SIGLE were searched to identify eligible randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Extracted data from RCTs were analyzed using STATA 11.0 statistical software with fixed or random effects model. Effect sizes were presented as weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Heterogeneity was assessed using the Chi-square test with significance level set at p < 0.1. 20 RCT trials were included into this meta-analysis. Among patients with omega-3 supplementation, triglyceride (TG) levels were significantly decreased by 0.24 mmol/L. No marked change in total cholesterol (TC), HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, postprandial plasma glucose, BMI or body weight was observed. High ratio of EPA/DHA contributed to a greater decreasing tendency in plasma insulin, HbAc1, TC, TG, and BMI measures, although no statistical significance was identified (except TG). FPG levels were increased by 0.42 mmol/L in Asians. No evidence of publication bias was observed in this meta-analysis. The ratio of EPA/DHA and early intervention with omega 3 fatty acids may affect their effects on glucose control and lipid levels, which may serve as a dietary reference for clinicians or nutritionists who manage diabetic patients.",Chen C; Yu X; Shao S,PloS one,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26431431/,0,0,0,1,0,0

26404370,Magnesium in Prevention and Therapy.,"Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body. It has been recognized as a cofactor for more than 300 enzymatic reactions, where it is crucial for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) metabolism. Magnesium is required for DNA and RNA synthesis, reproduction, and protein synthesis. Moreover, magnesium is essential for the regulation of muscular contraction, blood pressure, insulin metabolism, cardiac excitability, vasomotor tone, nerve transmission and neuromuscular conduction. Imbalances in magnesium status-primarily hypomagnesemia as it is seen more common than hypermagnesemia-might result in unwanted neuromuscular, cardiac or nervous disorders. Based on magnesium's many functions within the human body, it plays an important role in prevention and treatment of many diseases. Low levels of magnesium have been associated with a number of chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (e.g., stroke), migraine headaches, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).",Gröber U; Schmidt J; Kisters K,Nutrients,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26404370/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The current statistics and forecasts, both short- and long-term, are alarming and predict severe problems in the near future. Therefore, there is a race for developing new compounds, discovering new receptors, or finding alternative solutions to prevent and/or treat the symptoms and complications related to obesity and diabetes mellitus. It is well demonstrated that members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily play a crucial role in a variety of biological functions both in health and disease. In the recent years, transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) and transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) were shown to have beneficial effects on whole body metabolism including glucose homeostasis. TRPV1 and TRPA1 have been associated with control of weight, pancreatic function, hormone secretion, thermogenesis, and neuronal function, which suggest a potential therapeutic value of these channels.

26402520,Nutritional aspects of depression.,"Several nutrition, food and dietary compounds have been suggested to be involved in the onset and maintenance of depressive disorders and in the severity of depressive symptoms. Nutritional compounds might modulate depression associated biomarkers and parallel the development of depression, obesity and diabetes. In this context, recent studies revealed new mediators of both energy homeostasis and mood changes (i.e. IGF-1, NPY, BDNF, ghrelin, leptin, CCK, GLP-1, AGE, glucose metabolism and microbiota) acting in gut brain circuits. In this context several healthy foods such as olive oil, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, poultry, dairy and unprocessed meat have been inversely associated with depression risk and even have been postulated to improve depressive symptoms. In contrast, unhealthy western dietary patterns including the consumption of sweetened beverage, refined food, fried food, processed meat, refined grain, and high fat diary, biscuits, snacking and pastries have been shown to be associated with an increased risk of depression in longitudinal studies. However, it is always difficult to conclude a real prospective causal relationship from these mostly retrospective studies as depressed individuals might also change their eating habits secondarily to their depression. Additionally specific selected nutritional compounds, e.g. calcium, chromium, folate, PUFAs, vitamin D, B12, zinc, magnesium and D-serine have been postulated to be used as ad-on strategies in antidepressant treatment. In this context, dietary and lifestyle interventions may be a desirable, effective, pragmatical and non-stigmatizing prevention and treatment strategy for depression. At last, several medications (pioglitazone, metformin, exenatide, atorvastatin, gram-negative antibiotics), which have traditionally been used to treat metabolic disorders showed a certain potential to treat depression in first randomized controlled clinical trials.",Lang UE; Beglinger C; Schweinfurth N; Walter M; Borgwardt S,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26402520/,1,0,0,0,0,1

26400630,Could the beneficial effects of dietary calcium on obesity and diabetes control be mediated by changes in intestinal microbiota and integrity?,"Evidence from animal and human studies has associated gut microbiota, increased translocation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and reduced intestinal integrity (II) with the inflammatory state that occurs in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Consumption of Ca may favour body weight reduction and glycaemic control, but its influence on II and gut microbiota is not well understood. Considering the impact of metabolic diseases on public health and the role of Ca on the pathophysiology of these diseases, this review critically discusses possible mechanisms by which high-Ca diets could affect gut microbiota and II. Published studies from 1993 to 2015 about this topic were searched and selected from Medline/PubMed, Scielo and Lilacs databases. High-Ca diets seem to favour the growth of lactobacilli, maintain II (especially in the colon), reduce translocation of LPS and regulate tight-junction gene expression. We conclude that dietary Ca might interfere with gut microbiota and II modulations and it can partly explain the effect of Ca on obesity and T2DM control. However, further research is required to define the supplementation period, the dose and the type of Ca supplement (milk or salt) required for more effective results. As Ca interacts with other components of the diet, these interactions must also be considered in future studies. We believe that more complex mechanisms involving extraintestinal disorders (hormones, cytokines and other biomarkers) also need to be studied.",Gomes JM; Costa JA; Alfenas RC,The British journal of nutrition,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26400630/,1,0,0,0,0,0
26382010,Omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and fish oil supplementation during pregnancy: which evidence?,"The aim of this study was to provide evidence-based recommendations for omega-3 supplementation during pregnancy through a systematic review of level-1 data published on this topic. We reviewed all randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) including women who were randomized to treatment with either omega-3 supplementation or control (placebo or no treatment) during pregnancy and analyzed all the outcomes reported in the trials, separately. We planned to evaluate the effect of omega-3 on: preterm birth (PTB); pre-eclampsia (PE) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR); gestational diabetes; perinatal mortality; small for gestational age (SGA) and birth weight; infant eye and brain development; and postpartum depression. We identified 34 RCTs including 14 106 singletons and 2578 twins. These level-1 data showed that omega-3 was not associated with prevention of PTB, PE, IUGR, gestational diabetes, SGA, post-partum depression or better children development. Data about birth weight, perinatal mortality and childhood cognitive outcome were limited. Women with gestational diabetes who received omega-3 had significantly lower serum C-reactive protein concentrations, low incidence of hyperbilirubinemia in newborns and decreased newborns' hospitalization rate. There was not enough evidence to support the routine use of omega-3 supplementation during pregnancy. Given the 73% significant decrease in perinatal death in the singleton gestations who started omega-3 supplementation ≤ 20 weeks, further research is needed. Large RCTs in multiple gestations and longer follow-up are also required.",Saccone G; Saccone I; Berghella V,"The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26382010/,0,1,0,0,0,1
26376619,"Sugar consumption, metabolic disease and obesity: The state of the controversy.","The impact of sugar consumption on health continues to be a controversial topic. The objective of this review is to discuss the evidence and lack of evidence that allows the controversy to continue, and why resolution of the controversy is important. There are plausible mechanisms and research evidence that supports the suggestion that consumption of excess sugar promotes the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) both directly and indirectly. The direct pathway involves the unregulated hepatic uptake and metabolism of fructose, leading to liver lipid accumulation, dyslipidemia, decreased insulin sensitivity and increased uric acid levels. The epidemiological data suggest that these direct effects of fructose are pertinent to the consumption of the fructose-containing sugars, sucrose and high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which are the predominant added sugars. Consumption of added sugar is associated with development and/or prevalence of fatty liver, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, hyperuricemia, CVD and T2DM, often independent of body weight gain or total energy intake. There are diet intervention studies in which human subjects exhibited increased circulating lipids and decreased insulin sensitivity when consuming high sugar compared with control diets. Most recently, our group has reported that supplementing the ad libitum diets of young adults with beverages containing 0%, 10%, 17.5% or 25% of daily energy requirement (Ereq) as HFCS increased lipid/lipoprotein risk factors for CVD and uric acid in a dose-response manner. However, un-confounded studies conducted in healthy humans under a controlled, energy-balanced diet protocol that enables determination of the effects of sugar with diets that do not allow for body weight gain are lacking. Furthermore, recent reports conclude that there are no adverse effects of consuming beverages containing up to 30% Ereq sucrose or HFCS, and the conclusions from several meta-analyses suggest that fructose has no specific adverse effects relative to any other carbohydrate. Consumption of excess sugar may also promote the development of CVD and T2DM indirectly by causing increased body weight and fat gain, but this is also a topic of controversy. Mechanistically, it is plausible that fructose consumption causes increased energy intake and reduced energy expenditure due to its failure to stimulate leptin production. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain demonstrates that the brain responds differently to fructose or fructose-containing sugars compared with glucose or aspartame. Some epidemiological studies show that sugar consumption is associated with body weight gain, and there are intervention studies in which consumption of ad libitum high-sugar diets promoted increased body weight gain compared with consumption of ad libitum low- sugar diets. However, there are no studies in which energy intake and weight gain were compared in subjects consuming high or low sugar, blinded, ad libitum diets formulated to ensure both groups consumed a comparable macronutrient distribution and the same amounts of fiber. There is also little data to determine whether the form in which added sugar is consumed, as beverage or as solid food, affects its potential to promote weight gain. It will be very challenging to obtain the funding to conduct the clinical diet studies needed to address these evidence gaps, especially at the levels of added sugar that are commonly consumed. Yet, filling these evidence gaps may be necessary for supporting the policy changes that will help to turn the food environment into one that does not promote the development of obesity and metabolic disease.",Stanhope KL,Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26376619/,1,0,0,0,0,0

26313310,Effect of vitamins C and E on insulin resistance in diabetes: a meta-analysis study.,"Data regarding the effect of vitamin C (VC) and vitamin E (VE) supplementation on insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are controversial. We aimed to systematically review the current data on this topic. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted to assess the effect of VC and/or VE on insulin resistance in diabetes published in Google Scholar and PubMed web databases until January 2014 were included. Exclusion criteria were studies conducted in animal, type 1 DM, children or pregnant women. Main outcome measure was insulin resistance by homoeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index. According to degree of heterogeneity, fixed- or random-effect model was employed by stata software (11.0). We selected 14 RCTs involving 735 patients with T2DM. VE or mixture-mode supplementation did not have any significant effect on HOMA with a standardized mean difference (SMD): 0·017, 95% CI: -0·376 to 0·411 (P = 0·932); and SMD: -0·035, 95% CI: -0·634 to 0·025 (P = 0·070), respectively, by random-effect model. VC supplement alone did not improve insulin resistance with a SMD: -0·150, 95% CI: -0·494 to 0·194 (P = 0·391), by fixed-effect model. Meta-regression test demonstrated that HOMA index may have not been influenced by the year of publication, dosage or duration of treatment.

26308752,Effect of vitamin D supplementation on insulin resistance and glycaemic control in prediabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"To evaluate the effect of vitamin D on insulin resistance and glycaemic control in prediabetes. A literature search was conducted of MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus, Web of Science and www.clinicaltrials.gov, together with a historical search through the reference lists of relevant articles until end of June 2014. Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials of vitamin D or vitamin D analogues in prediabetes and if they reported homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance or 2-h plasma glucose after oral glucose tolerance test. Treatment effect was estimated according to mean difference in the changes from baseline of homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, 2-h oral glucose tolerance test plasma glucose, fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c between vitamin D and control groups. Meta-analysis of eligible studies was performed. A total of 10 randomized controlled trials were included. Vitamin D did not significantly improve homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and 2-h oral glucose tolerance test plasma glucose: the mean differences were -0.06 (95% CI -0.36 to 0.24) and -0.23 mmol/l (95% CI -0.65 to 0.19), respectively. Subgroup analysis suggested that vitamin D improved homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance in a subgroup with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D ≥ 50 nmol/l [mean difference -0.59 (95% CI -1.14 to -0.04); P = 0.03] and improved 2-h oral glucose tolerance test plasma glucose in the subgroup with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 50 nmol/l [mean difference -0.68 mmol/l (95% CI -1.35 to -0.01); P = 0.05]. Vitamin D significantly reduced fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels. The mean differences were -0.10 mmol/l (95% CI -0.18 to -0.03), P = 0.006 and -1 mmol/mol (95% CI -2 to 0), P = 0.008, respectively.

26301243,Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Early Prevention of Inflammatory Neurodegenerative Disease: A Focus on Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and the most common neurodegenerative disease in the elderly. Furthermore, AD has provided the most positive indication to support the fact that inflammation contributes to neurodegenerative disease. The exact etiology of AD is unknown, but environmental and genetic factors are thought to contribute, such as advancing age, family history, presence of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes, and poor diet and lifestyle. It is hypothesised that early prevention or management of inflammation could delay the onset or reduce the symptoms of AD. Normal physiological changes to the brain with ageing include depletion of long chain omega-3 fatty acids and brains of AD patients have lower docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels. DHA supplementation can reduce markers of inflammation. This review specifically focusses on the evidence in humans from epidemiological, dietary intervention, and supplementation studies, which supports the role of long chain omega-3 fatty acids in the prevention or delay of cognitive decline in AD in its early stages. Longer term trials with long chain omega-3 supplementation in early stage AD are warranted. We also highlight the importance of overall quality and composition of the diet to protect against AD and dementia.",Thomas J; Thomas CJ; Radcliffe J; Itsiopoulos C,BioMed research international,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26301243/,1,0,0,0,0,0
26300378,Supportive interventions for enhancing dietary intake in malnourished or nutritionally at-risk adults: a systematic review of nonrandomised studies.,"Supportive interventions for enhancing dietary intake in malnourished or nutritionally at risk adults are frequently recommended. A recent systematic review of randomised controlled trials identified limited and poor quality evidence to support their use. Observational studies have been shown to compliment and extend their evidence. This review aimed to synthesise evidence from nonrandomised studies aiming to improve nutritional intake in nutritionally vulnerable individuals and to describe their effects on cost, nutritional, clinical and patient centred outcomes. Systematic searches of 10 electronic databases were undertaken to May 2013. Reference lists of identified studies and systematic reviews were scrutinised and hand searching of relevant meeting abstracts was undertaken. Titles and abstracts were reviewed, data extracted by two research-ers working independently and summarised using a structured narrative format. Forty-one studies (n = 3751 participants) were identified for inclusion. Interventions identified included changes to the organisation of nutritional care (n = 15), changes to the feeding environment (n = 11), modification to meals (n = 6), supplementation of meals (n = 7) and recipients of home delivered meals (n = 2). Eighteen of 23 studies reported improvements in nutritional intake; however, effects on nutritional status, clinical outcomes and costs were reported in few studies and findings were inconsistent. Eighteen studies reported patient experience, highlighting benefits to nutritional status most commonly as judged by the carers but the methods used lacked rigour. This systematic review describes a range of interventions that may be implemented in clinical practice. A limited range of outcomes are reported and it is difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions on the effect of the different methods.",Kimber K; Gibbs M; Weekes CE; Baldwin C,Journal of human nutrition and dietetics : the official journal of the British Dietetic Association,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26300378/,0,1,0,0,0,0
26286461,Zinc as a micronutrient and its preventive role of oxidative damage in cells.,"Zinc is an essential trace element with special importance in the immune system. Deficiencies of zinc are seen in the course of ageing and in various diseases, such as diabetes mellitus or rheumathoid arthritis. The trace element is essential for a variety of basic cellular functions and especially important for various enzymes participating in the production and neutralization of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are normally produced by the cell. Under normal conditions ROS are neutralized and are not able to harm the cell, but in case of ROS elevation, oxidative damage within the cell is the result. Interestingly, zinc deficiency is directly associated with oxidative stress. Thus, control and regulation of the intracellular zinc content is essential with participation of various transporter and zinc-binding proteins, such as metallothionein. Oxidative stress is mainly caused by elevated ROS production and a decrease of antioxidant mechanisms. Zinc partly functions as an antioxidant although it is redox inert. Zinc supplementation is associated with decreased ROS formation exhibiting beneficial effects especially in ageing and diabetes mellitus. This review summarizes current findings concerning zinc as a micronutrient and its actions as a pro-antioxidant, and the association between zinc and oxidative stress under various conditions is highlighted.",Kloubert V; Rink L,Food & function,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26286461/,1,0,0,0,0,0
26277110,Bariatric Nutrition Guidelines for the Indian Population.,"Bariatric surgery numbers have seen a sharp rise in India in the last decade. A country known for its undernourished population has seen economic growth and with it, greater influence of western culture and foods. The obesity epidemic is on the rise here and India is one of the 10 most obese nations of the world being second only to China in the number of type 2 diabetes. Nutritionists in India often rely on recommendations and guidelines meant for the Caucasian population. Religious and cultural practices influence the dietary habits and patterns of the Indian population to a great extent; because of which the nutritional requirements are very different. This document was put together with an aim to provide nutritionists with recommendations on how to manage the Indian bariatric patient. A bariatric nutrition round table meeting was initiated by the Centre for Obesity and Digestive Surgery (CODS) to bring together experts in the field of bariatric nutrition to review current data on nutritional deficiencies in the morbid obese and existing post-operative deficiencies and to formulate nutritional recommendations for bariatric/metabolic surgery specific to patients from India. Percentage of nutritional deficiencies and reasons for the same were identified among the Indian population and recommendations were made to suit this particular population. It is recommended that all patients undergo compulsory pre-operative nutritional counseling and nutritional investigations and that nutritional follow-up be continued lifelong. In addition, long-term implications like hypoglycemia, dumping syndrome, sugar cravings, and weight regain, need to be picked up and managed efficiently. Most importantly, post-operative supplementation is a must irrespective of type of surgery.",Remedios C; Bhasker AG; Dhulla N; Dhar S; Lakdawala M,Obesity surgery,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26277110/,0,0,0,0,0,1

To know the intake of vitamins D and K in female population and analyze their involvement on health. Literature research regarding the topic. Intake of vitamin D in the Spanish female population from 17 to 60 years is lower than the estimated average requirement in the 95.5% of the studied participants and 30.2% of the Spanish population does not meet the established adequate intake for vitamin K. Several studies have emphasized the importance of maintaining optimal nutrition status of vitamin D for its role in the maintenance of bone, but also for its involvement in body weight control and prevention of diseases (cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer). Vitamin K deficiency is also associated with decreased bone density and increased cardiovascular risk besides exerting a protective effect against type 2 diabetes. In female population, the intake of vitamin K, but especially vitamin D, is often lower than recommended. Since a worse nutritional status in these vitamins is associated with damage in bone health, weight control, as well as an increased risk of several diseases, it seems appropriate to monitor and improve their intake.",Navia Lombán B; Cuadrado Soto E; Ortega RM,Nutricion hospitalaria,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26267768/,1,0,0,1,0,0

In this study, a meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of fish oil supplementation on these gestational complications. Randomized controlled human trials that investigated the effects of fish oil supplementation in pregnant women were identified by a systematic search of Medline, Embase, and Cochrane's Library, and references of related reviews and studies up to December 2014. Relative risks (RRs) for GDM, PIH, and PE were the outcomes of interest. Fixed-effects or random-effects models were applied according to the heterogeneity. Thirteen comparisons from 11 published articles, including more than 5000 participants, were included. The results showed that fish oil supplementation was not associated with reduced risks for GDM (RR=1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-1.32, p=0.60), PIH (RR=1.03, 95% CI: 0.89-1.20, p=0.66), or PE (RR=0.93, 95% CI: 0.74-1.16, p=0.51). No statistically significant heterogeneity was detected for the comparison of each outcome. The effects of fish oil on these gestational complications were consistent between women with low-risk and high-risk pregnancies.

26238534,Vitamin D and diabetic nephropathy: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"There has been a long history documenting the use of different vitamin D derivatives as therapy for renal diseases. However, to our knowledge, there is no comprehensive assessment of the relation between vitamin D deficiency and risk for diabetic nephropathy (DN). Additionally, the effect of vitamin D supplementation on DN is still unclear. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess these issues by pooling together the results from cross-sectional studies and clinical trials. A systematic literature search of PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar was conducted, ending in September 2014. For cross-sectional studies, odds ratio was used as a measure of the association between vitamin D status and risk for DN; for clinical trials, mean and SD of the main outcome (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR]) in intervention and placebo groups were considered for analysis. The final selected articles were published between 2009 and 2014. In all, 3700 and 219 patients were enrolled in observational and interventional studies, respectively. The pooled odds ratio from six cross-sectional studies was 1.80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25-2.59; P = 0.002), indicating a significant inverse association between serum vitamin D status and risk for nephropathy in patients with diabetes. However, the pooled data of UACR levels in clinical trials suggested no significant change following vitamin D supplementation (17.98; 95% CI, -35.35 to 71.32; P = 0.51). This meta-analysis showed the higher risk for nephropathy in vitamin D-deficient patients with diabetes.

26235242,α-Lipoic acid as a triglyceride-lowering nutraceutical.,"Considering the current obesity epidemic in the United States (>100 million adults are overweight or obese), the prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia is likely to grow beyond present statistics of ∼30% of the population. Conventional therapies for managing hypertriglyceridemia include lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise, pharmacological approaches, and nutritional supplements. It is critically important to identify new strategies that would be safe and effective in lowering hypertriglyceridemia. α-Lipoic acid (LA) is a naturally occurring enzyme cofactor found in the human body in small quantities. A growing body of evidence indicates a role of LA in ameliorating metabolic dysfunction and lipid anomalies primarily in animals. Limited human studies suggest LA is most efficacious in situations where blood triglycerides are markedly elevated. LA is commercially available as dietary supplements and is clinically shown to be safe and effective against diabetic polyneuropathies. LA is described as a potent biological antioxidant, a detoxification agent, and a diabetes medicine. Given its strong safety record, LA may be a useful nutraceutical, either alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering strategies, when treating severe hypertriglyceridemia and diabetic dyslipidemia. This review examines the current evidence regarding the use of LA as a means of normalizing blood triglycerides. Also presented are the leading mechanisms of action of LA on triglyceride metabolism.",Pashaj A; Xia M; Moreau R,Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26235242/,1,0,0,0,0,0
26228533,Gingerols and shogaols: Important nutraceutical principles from ginger.,"Gingerols are the major pungent compounds present in the rhizomes of ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) and are renowned for their contribution to human health and nutrition. Medicinal properties of ginger, including the alleviation of nausea, arthritis and pain, have been associated with the gingerols. Gingerol analogues are thermally labile and easily undergo dehydration reactions to form the corresponding shogaols, which impart the characteristic pungent taste to dried ginger. Both gingerols and shogaols exhibit a host of biological activities, ranging from anticancer, anti-oxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic to various central nervous system activities. Shogaols are important biomarkers used for the quality control of many ginger-containing products, due to their diverse biological activities. In this review, a large body of available knowledge on the biosynthesis, chemical synthesis and pharmacological activities, as well as on the structure-activity relationships of various gingerols and shogaols, have been collated, coherently summarised and discussed. The manuscript highlights convincing evidence indicating that these phenolic compounds could serve as important lead molecules for the development of therapeutic agents to treat various life-threatening human diseases, particularly cancer. Inclusion of ginger or ginger extracts in nutraceutical formulations could provide valuable protection against diabetes, cardiac and hepatic disorders.",Semwal RB; Semwal DK; Combrinck S; Viljoen AM,Phytochemistry,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26228533/,1,0,0,0,0,0
26206997,[Supplementation with omega fatty acids in various diseases].,"For some decades, an increase in propagation of coronary heart disease, obesity, diabetes, tumors and mental disorders has been observed. Consequently, new and effective methods of treatment of these diseases using drugs and diet supplements have been developed. A promising solution is the use of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the treatment of some diseases. These compounds have broad application in prevention of many diseases and are used to support standard therapies. Their activity is connected with participation in metabolic processes regulating biochemical transformations in cells and tissues. Omega-3 fatty acids regulate production of cytokines, increased levels of which may contribute to occurrence of chronic inflammatory diseases, autoaggression of the immunological system, arteriosclerosis or tumor development. These substances exert a beneficial effect on the blood system by improvement of blood circulation and nerve signal transmission. Omega-3 fatty acids reduce the risk of irregular heartbeat, stabilize arterial pressure, and restore balance in cholesterol metabolism disorders. They also play a key role in maintaining physical and mental efficiency; thus administration of these compounds for young children is of great importance. Nevertheless, administration of omega-3 fatty acids in the diet seems to be essential. The purpose of this study is to present the structure and sources of omega-3 and - 6 fatty acids and discuss the problems concerning therapeutic use of these compounds in various disorders.",Sicińska P; Pytel E; Kurowska J; Koter-Michalak M,Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26206997/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess whether vitamin D and calcium supplements cause changes in adiposity. MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched for literature published from 1966 to March 2014. A systematic search was conducted for randomized clinical trials with ≥ 50 participants aged ≥ 18 years at baseline who had received at least 12 weeks of treatment. Among the inclusion criteria were supplementation with vitamin D with or without calcium and measurement of adiposity (weight, body mass index [BMI], and/or fat mass). The primary endpoints assessed were changes in weight, BMI, or fat mass. Of 953 trials identified, 26 randomized clinical trials (n = 12, vitamin D alone; n = 10, vitamin D plus calcium versus calcium control; n = 4, vitamin D plus calcium versus placebo) with a total of 42,430 participants (median duration, 12 months) met the inclusion criteria. When compared with placebo, vitamin D supplementation had no significant effect on BMI (weighted mean difference [WMD], -0.06 kg/m(2); 95% confidence interval [95%CI], -0.14 to 0.03), weight (WMD, -0.05 kg; 95%CI, -0.32 to 0.23), or fat mass (WMD, -0.43 kg; 95%CI, -1.69 to 0.84). Likewise, no significant reduction in BMI (WMD, 0.02 kg/m(2); 95%CI, -0.11 to 0.14), weight (WMD, 0.12 kg; 95%CI, -0.24 to 0.49), or fat mass (WMD, 0.12 kg; 95%CI, -0.22 to 0.45) was observed in participants who received vitamin D plus calcium compared with those who received calcium control.

We are aimed to summarize all experimental (murine in vivo and in vitro murine embryo studies) and clinical (human) evidences regarding the role of inositol in the prevention and treatment of folate-resistant embryo neural tube defects (FR-NTDs) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). We also collected all information regarding the effect that inositol supplementation may have in the metabolic reassessment of early and late pregnancy in order to draw evidence-based conclusions and suggest further studies defining the potential therapeutic role of this molecule in human reproduction. The systematic review of literature clearly showed that inositol supplementation in preconceptional period and in early phase of pregnancy reduces the risk of developing GDM in patients at increased risk. Furthermore, continued intake during pregnancy improves the metabolic status of affected patients, but further studies are needed to confirm this end point. All women at risk of FR-NTDs assuming inositol from the periconceptional period until late pregnancy are reported to have healthy newborns without any significant complications linked to inositol supplementation.",Noventa M; Vitagliano A; Quaranta M; Borgato S; Abdulrahim B; Gizzo S,"Reproductive sciences (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)",2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26175275/,0,1,0,0,0,0

This review was conducted to determine the extent to which adults with CF are meeting current nutrition recommendations for micronutrients in association with CF-related complications management. Although dietary intake and nutritional status in CF has improved significantly in recent decades, micronutrient status seems to have diverged. While vitamin A and E intakes appear adequate, frequent vitamin D and K deficiency/insufficiency and compromised bone health in CF, occurs despite supplementation. Although deficiency of water-soluble vitamins and minerals is uncommon, ongoing surveillance will enhance overall health outcomes, particularly in cases of CF-related liver disease and deteriorated lung function and bone health. Salt and fluid status in CF may also need attention due to diminished thirst sensation and voluntary rehydration.

26100832,Dietary supplement consumption among cardiac patients admitted to internal medicine and cardiac wards.,"Dietary supplements may have adverse effects and potentially interact with conventional medications. They are perceived as ""natural"" products, free of side effects with no need for medical consultation. Little is known about consumption of dietary supplements by patients with cardiac diseases. The objective of this study was to investigate dietary supplement consumption among cardiac patients admitted to internal and cardiology wards. Potential drug-dietary supplement interactions were also assessed. During a period of 6 months, patients with cardiac disease hospitalized in the Internal Medicine and Cardiology Wards at Assaf Harofeh Medical Center were evaluated regarding their dietary supplement consumption. A literature survey examining possible drug-supplement interaction was performed. Out of 149 cardiac patients, 45% were dietary supplement consumers. Patients ad-mitted to the Internal Medicine Wards consumed more dietary supplements than those admit-ted to the Cardiology Division. Dietary supplement consumption was associated with older age (OR = 1.05, p = 0.022), female gender (OR = 2.94, p = 0.014) and routine physical activity (OR = 3.15, p = 0.007). Diabetes mellitus (OR = 2.68, p = 0.020), hematological diseases (OR = 13.29, p = 0.022), and the use of anti-diabetic medications (OR = 4.28, p = 0.001) were independently associated with dietary supplement intake. Sixteen potential moderate interactions between prescribed medications and dietary supplements were found. Consumption of dietary supplements is common among cardiac patients. It is more common in those admitted to Internal Medicine Departments than in those admitted to the Cardiology Wards. Due to the risk of various drug-supplement interactions consumed by patients with cardiac diseases, there is a need to increase awareness and knowledge among medical staff regarding the intake of dietary supplements.",Karny-Rahkovich O; Blatt A; Elbaz-Greener GA; Ziv-Baran T; Golik A; Berkovitch M,Cardiology journal,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26100832/,1,0,0,0,0,0
26098475,"Obesity, Metabolic Syndrome, and Dietary Therapeutical Approaches with a Special Focus on Nutraceuticals (Polyphenols): A Mini-Review.","More than half of all global deaths in 2010 were related to non-communicable diseases, including obesity, cancers, diabetes, and cardiovascular illnesses. It has been suggested that the alarming increase in the incidence of cardiovascular disease is the epidemiologic result of a nutrition transition characterized by dietary patterns featuring an increase in the intake of total fat, cholesterol, sugars, and other refined carbohydrates, concomitant with low consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids and fiber. Although traditional dietary approaches have proven successful as part of the treatment for obesity and cardiometabolic derangements within clinical trial scenarios, they lack effectiveness in the long term, mainly due to poor compliance. Research has thus turned its attention to nutraceutics, nutrients that have the ability to modulate physiological and pathophysiological molecular mechanisms, thus resulting in favorable health outcomes. Polyphenols have been considered as among the bioactive molecules as they are thought to yield beneficial effects by exerting antioxidant activity; however, there are other--and even more robust--metabolic pathways through which polyphenols enhance cardiovascular health, such as via promoting vasodilatory, anti-atherogenic, antithrombotic, and anti-inflammatory effects.

26066364,"The beneficial role of curcumin on inflammation, diabetes and neurodegenerative disease: A recent update.","The concept of using phytochemicals has ushered in a new revolution in pharmaceuticals. Naturally occurring polyphenols (like curcumin, morin, resveratrol, etc.) have gained importance because of their minimal side effects, low cost and abundance. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is a component of turmeric isolated from the rhizome of Curcuma longa. Research for more than two decades has revealed the pleiotropic nature of the biological effects of this molecule. More than 7000 published articles have shed light on the various aspects of curcumin including its antioxidant, hypoglycemic, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities. Apart from these well-known activities, this natural polyphenolic compound also exerts its beneficial effects by modulating different signalling molecules including transcription factors, chemokines, cytokines, tumour suppressor genes, adhesion molecules, microRNAs, etc. Oxidative stress and inflammation play a pivotal role in various diseases like diabetes, cancer, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular diseases. Curcumin, therefore, could be a therapeutic option for the treatment of these diseases, provided limitations in its oral bioavailability can be overcome. The current review provides an updated overview of the metabolism and mechanism of action of curcumin in various organ pathophysiologies. The review also discusses the potential for multifunctional therapeutic application of curcumin and its recent progress in clinical biology.",Ghosh S; Banerjee S; Sil PC,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26066364/,1,0,0,0,0,0
26024397,Health effects of changes in the structure of dietary macronutrients intake in western societies.,"A Western-type diet, characterized by a significant share of highly processed and refined foods and high content of sugars, salt, fat and protein from red meat, has been recognized as an important factor contributing to the development of metabolic disorders and the obesity epidemic around the world. Excessive body fat causes metabolic pathologies, such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and cancer. According to the World Health Organization 1.5 billion adults are overweight, nearly 500 million are obese and 220 million suffer from type 2 diabetes. The Western-type diet is also associated with an increased incidence of chronic kidney disease. It is known that a combination of nutrients typical for this diet contributes to impaired renal function, renal steatosis and inflammation, hypertension and dysfunctional renal hormonal regulation. The Western diet is also associated with a chronic inflammatory process that is involved in all stages of atherosclerosis development and is increasingly recognized as a universal mechanism of various chronic degenerative diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, some neoplasms or osteoporosis. The present article is focused on the results of the most recent research investigating the effects of dietary macronutrients and the type of fatty acids on selected mechanisms associated with the occurrence of the most common diet-related diseases.",Okręglicka K,Roczniki Panstwowego Zakladu Higieny,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26024397/,1,0,0,0,0,0
26020622,Zinc supplementation for the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults with insulin resistance.,"Diabetes is associated with long-term damage, dysfunction and failure of various organs, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart and blood vessels. The risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with age, obesity and lack of physical activity. Insulin resistance is a fundamental aspect of the aetiology of type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance has been shown to be associated with atherosclerosis, dyslipidaemia, glucose intolerance, hyperuricaemia, hypertension and polycystic ovary syndrome. The mineral zinc plays a key role in the synthesis and action of insulin, both physiologically and in diabetes mellitus. Zinc seems to stimulate insulin action and insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity. To assess the effects of zinc supplementation for the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults with insulin resistance. This review is an update of a previous Cochrane systematic review published in 2007. We searched the Cochrane Library (2015, Issue 3), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and the ICTRP trial register (from inception to March 2015). There were no language restrictions. We conducted citation searches and screened reference lists of included studies. We included studies if they had a randomised or quasi-randomised design and if they investigated zinc supplementation compared with placebo or no intervention in adults with insulin resistance living in the community. Two review authors selected relevant trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We included three trials with a total of 128 participants in this review. The duration of zinc supplementation ranged between four and 12 weeks. Risk of bias was unclear for most studies regarding selection bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment) and detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment). No study reported on our key outcome measures (incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, adverse events, health-related quality of life, all-cause mortality, diabetic complications, socioeconomic effects). Evaluation of insulin resistance as measured by the Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) showed neutral effects when comparing zinc supplementation with control (two trials; 114 participants). There were neutral effects for trials comparing zinc supplementation with placebo for total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides (2 studies, 70 participants). The one trial comparing zinc supplementation with exercise also showed neutral effects for total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol, and a mean difference in triglycerides of -30 mg/dL (95% confidence interval (CI) -49 to -10) in favour of zinc supplementation (53 participants). Various surrogate laboratory parameters were also analysed in the included trials. There is currently no evidence on which to base the use of zinc supplementation for the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Future trials should investigate patient-important outcome measures such as incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, health-related quality of life, diabetic complications, all-cause mortality and socioeconomic effects.",El Dib R; Gameiro OL; Ogata MS; Módolo NS; Braz LG; Jorge EC; do Nascimento P; Beletate V,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26020622/,0,1,0,0,0,0
26009596,Familial hypercholesterolaemia in children and adolescents: gaining decades of life by optimizing detection and treatment.,"Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a common genetic cause of premature coronary heart disease (CHD). Globally, one baby is born with FH every minute. If diagnosed and treated early in childhood, individuals with FH can have normal life expectancy. This consensus paper aims to improve awareness of the need for early detection and management of FH children. Familial hypercholesterolaemia is diagnosed either on phenotypic criteria, i.e. an elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level plus a family history of elevated LDL-C, premature coronary artery disease and/or genetic diagnosis, or positive genetic testing. Childhood is the optimal period for discrimination between FH and non-FH using LDL-C screening. An LDL-C ≥5 mmol/L (190 mg/dL), or an LDL-C ≥4 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) with family history of premature CHD and/or high baseline cholesterol in one parent, make the phenotypic diagnosis. If a parent has a genetic defect, the LDL-C cut-off for the child is ≥3.5 mmol/L (130 mg/dL). We recommend cascade screening of families using a combined phenotypic and genotypic strategy. In children, testing is recommended from age 5 years, or earlier if homozygous FH is suspected. A healthy lifestyle and statin treatment (from age 8 to 10 years) are the cornerstones of management of heterozygous FH. Target LDL-C is <3.5 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) if >10 years, or ideally 50% reduction from baseline if 8-10 years, especially with very high LDL-C, elevated lipoprotein(a), a family history of premature CHD or other cardiovascular risk factors, balanced against the long-term risk of treatment side effects. Identifying FH early and optimally lowering LDL-C over the lifespan reduces cumulative LDL-C burden and offers health and socioeconomic benefits. To drive policy change for timely detection and management, we call for further studies in the young. Increased awareness, early identification, and optimal treatment from childhood are critical to adding decades of healthy life for children and adolescents with FH.",Wiegman A; Gidding SS; Watts GF; Chapman MJ; Ginsberg HN; Cuchel M; Ose L; Averna M; Boileau C; Borén J; Bruckert E; Catapano AL; Defesche JC; Descamps OS; Hegele RA; Hovingh GK; Humphries SE; Kovanen PT; Kuivenhoven JA; Masana L; Nordestgaard BG; Pajukanta P; Parhofer KG; Raal FJ; Ray KK; Santos RD; Stalenhoef AF; Steinhagen-Thiessen E; Stroes ES; Taskinen MR; Tybjærg-Hansen A; Wiklund O,European heart journal,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26009596/,1,0,0,0,0,0
26007339,"Reviewing the Effects of L-Leucine Supplementation in the Regulation of Food Intake, Energy Balance, and Glucose Homeostasis.","Leucine is a well-known activator of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Because mTOR signaling regulates several aspects of metabolism, the potential of leucine as a dietary supplement for treating obesity and diabetes mellitus has been investigated. The objective of the present review was to summarize and discuss the available evidence regarding the mechanisms and the effects of leucine supplementation on the regulation of food intake, energy balance, and glucose homeostasis. Based on the available evidence, we conclude that although central leucine injection decreases food intake, this effect is not well reproduced when leucine is provided as a dietary supplement. Consequently, no robust evidence indicates that oral leucine supplementation significantly affects food intake, although several studies have shown that leucine supplementation may help to decrease body adiposity in specific conditions. However, more studies are necessary to assess the effects of leucine supplementation in already-obese subjects. Finally, although several studies have found that leucine supplementation improves glucose homeostasis, the underlying mechanisms involved in these potential beneficial effects remain unknown and may be partially dependent on weight loss.",Pedroso JA; Zampieri TT; Donato J,Nutrients,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26007339/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25997382,The role of dietary coconut for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease: potential mechanisms of action.,"Coconut, Cocos nucifera L., is a tree that is cultivated to provide a large number of products, although it is mainly grown for its nutritional and medicinal values. Coconut oil, derived from the coconut fruit, has been recognised historically as containing high levels of saturated fat; however, closer scrutiny suggests that coconut should be regarded more favourably. Unlike most other dietary fats that are high in long-chain fatty acids, coconut oil comprises medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA). MCFA are unique in that they are easily absorbed and metabolised by the liver, and can be converted to ketones. Ketone bodies are an important alternative energy source in the brain, and may be beneficial to people developing or already with memory impairment, as in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Coconut is classified as a highly nutritious 'functional food'. It is rich in dietary fibre, vitamins and minerals; however, notably, evidence is mounting to support the concept that coconut may be beneficial in the treatment of obesity, dyslipidaemia, elevated LDL, insulin resistance and hypertension - these are the risk factors for CVD and type 2 diabetes, and also for AD. In addition, phenolic compounds and hormones (cytokinins) found in coconut may assist in preventing the aggregation of amyloid-β peptide, potentially inhibiting a key step in the pathogenesis of AD. The purpose of the present review was to explore the literature related to coconut, outlining the known mechanistic physiology, and to discuss the potential role of coconut supplementation as a therapeutic option in the prevention and management of AD.",Fernando WM; Martins IJ; Goozee KG; Brennan CS; Jayasena V; Martins RN,The British journal of nutrition,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25997382/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25987426,Modulation of inflammation and immunity by dietary conjugated linoleic acid.,"Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a mixture of positional and geometric isomers of linoleic acid. This family of polyunsaturated fatty acids has drawn significant attention in the last three decades for its variety of biologically beneficial properties and health effects. CLA has been shown to exert various potent protective functions such as anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, antiadipogenic, antidiabetic and antihypertensive properties in animal models of disease. Therefore, CLA represents a nutritional avenue to prevent lifestyle diseases or metabolic syndrome. Initially, the overall effects of CLA were thought to be the result of interactions between its two major isomers: cis-9, trans-11 and trans-10, cis-12. However, later evidence suggests that such physiological effects of CLA might be different between the isomers: t-10, c-12-CLA is thought to be anticarcinogenic, antiobesity and antidiabetic, whereas c-9, t-11-CLA is mainly anti-inflammatory. Although preclinical data support a benefit of CLA supplementation, human clinical findings have yet to show definitive evidence of a positive effect. The purpose of this review is to comprehensively summarize the mechanisms of action and anti-inflammatory properties of dietary CLA supplementation and evaluate the potential uses of CLA in human health and disease.",Viladomiu M; Hontecillas R; Bassaganya-Riera J,European journal of pharmacology,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25987426/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25974693,New Insights into the Regulation of Chylomicron Production.,"Dietary lipids are efficiently absorbed by the small intestine, incorporated into triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons), and transported in the circulation to various tissues. Intestinal lipid absorption and mobilization and chylomicron synthesis and secretion are highly regulated processes. Elevated chylomicron production rate contributes to the dyslipidemia seen in common metabolic disorders such as insulin-resistant states and type 2 diabetes and likely increases the risk for atherosclerosis seen in these conditions. An in-depth understanding of the regulation of chylomicron production may provide leads for the development of drugs that could be of therapeutic utility in the prevention of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Chylomicron secretion is subject to regulation by various factors, including diet, body weight, genetic variants, hormones, nutraceuticals, medications, and emerging interventions such as bariatric surgical procedures. In this review we discuss the regulation of chylomicron production, mechanisms that underlie chylomicron dysregulation, and potential avenues for future research.",Dash S; Xiao C; Morgantini C; Lewis GF,Annual review of nutrition,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25974693/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25974384,Prevention of gestational diabetes mellitus: Where are we now?,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing at a rapid rate, driven by the increasing proportion of the population that is overweight/obese from a young age. More than 25 randomized controlled trials testing whether GDM can be prevented have now reported their findings, but only four different interventions have shown a reduction in the proportion of women with GDM (healthy eating alone, healthy eating with physical activity, myoinositol supplementation and probiotic treatment), and these results have not been replicated. The interventions tested to date include different diets and different forms of physical activity, in combination or alone, vitamin D, myoinositol, probiotics and metformin. Studies could be improved by using the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group criteria for GDM (which are probably more sensitive to change because of their multiple time points), targeting and tailoring interventions to subgroups most likely to benefit, and separating those with GDM early in pregnancy from those developing GDM de novo. The greatest societal benefit is likely to arise from population-based lifestyle approaches which include those women yet to become pregnant and those who are already pregnant and their families; an approach that is yet to be fully tested.",Simmons D,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25974384/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25974209,Magnesium and disturbances in carbohydrate metabolism.,"Magnesium is actively involved in a number of metabolic reactions as an important co-factor, with special emphasis on carbohydrate metabolism. After a brief overview of the regulation of intra- and extracellular magnesium, the present review first describes the regulatory role of magnesium in important metabolic pathways involved in energy metabolism and glycaemic control. Next the clinical significance of hypomagnesaemic conditions with regard to the management of glucose in prediabetic stages, such as insulin resistance/impaired glucose tolerance and in type 2 diabetes mellitus are characterized. Cross-sectional as well as longitudinal studies suggest that a reduced dietary magnesium intake serves as a risk factor for the incidence of both impaired glucose regulation and type 2 diabetes. Mechanisms that might be responsible for diabetes-associated hypomagnesaemia are discussed. Furthermore, the role of hypomagnesaemia in the development and progression of chronic diabetic complications are addressed. Finally, the available literature on the effects of magnesium supplementation on glycaemic control parameters during prediabetic conditions (preventive approach) as well as type 2 diabetes mellitus (therapeutic approach) are reviewed systematically. There is considerable evidence that chronic magnesium supplementation may delay the progression from impaired glucose regulation to type 2 diabetes; however, the effects of oral magnesium supplementation as an adjunct therapy for type 2 diabetes are quite heterogeneous with respect to the various measures of glycaemic control. The results of this review suggest a requirement for critical consideration of the pros and cons of magnesium replacement therapy, based on variables such as magnesium status, stage of disease and glycaemic control.",Mooren FC,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25974209/,1,0,0,0,0,1
25971701,Biology and biotechnology of hyaluronan.,"The hyaluronan (HA) polymer is a critical component of extracellular matrix with a remarkable structure: is a linear and unbranched polymer without sulphate or phosphate groups. It is ubiquitous in mammals showing several biological functions, ranging from cell proliferation and migration to angiogenesis and inflammation. For its critical biological functions the amount of HA in tissues is carefully controlled by different mechanisms including covalent modification of the synthetic enzymes and epigenetic control of their gene expression. The concentration of HA is also critical in several pathologies including cancer, diabetes and inflammation. Beside these biological roles, the structural properties of HA allow it to take advantage of its capacity to form gels even at concentration of 1 % producing scaffolds with very promising applications in regenerative medicine as biocompatible material for advanced therapeutic uses. In this review we highlight the biological aspects of HA addressing the mechanisms controlling the HA content in tissues as well as its role in important human pathologies. In the second part of the review we highlight the different use of HA polymers in the modern biotechnology.",Viola M; Vigetti D; Karousou E; D'Angelo ML; Caon I; Moretto P; De Luca G; Passi A,Glycoconjugate journal,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25971701/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25971249,Effect of chromium supplementation on glycated hemoglobin and fasting plasma glucose in patients with diabetes mellitus.,"Chromium (Cr) is a trace element involved in glucose homeostasis. We aim to evaluate and quantify the effects of Cr supplementation on A1C and FPG in patients with T2DM. A systematic literature search of Pubmed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library (from database inception to 11/2014) with no language restrictions sought RCTs or cohort studies evaluating Cr supplementation in T2DM vs control and reporting either change in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) or fasting plasma glucose (FPG). Meta-analysis was conducted on each subtype of Cr supplement separately, and was analyzed by random effects model to yield the weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity was assessed by using the I(2) statistic. A total of 14 RCTs (n=875 participants, mean age range: 30 to 83 years old, 8 to 24 weeks of follow-up) were identified (Cr chloride: n=3 study, Cr picolinate: n=5 study, brewer's yeast: n=4 study and Cr yeast: n=3 study). Compared with placebo, Cr yeast, brewer's yeast and Cr picolinate did not show statistically significant effects on A1C. Furthermore, compared to control, Cr chloride, Cr yeast and Cr picolinate showed no effect on FPG, however, brewer's yeast showed a statistically significant decrease in FPG -19.23 mg/dL (95% CI=-35.30 to -3.16, I(2)=21%, n=137).

25963488,Vitamin A as a key regulator of obesity & its associated disorders: Evidences from an obese rat model.,"During the last century, vitamin A has evolved from its classical role as a fat-soluble vitamin and attained the status of para-/autocrine hormone. Besides its well-established role in embryogenesis, growth and development, reproduction and vision, vitamin A has also been implicated in several other physiological processes. Emerging experimental evidences emphasize adipose tissue as an active endocrine organ with great propensity to continuous growth (throughout life). Due to various genetic and lifestyle factors, excess energy accumulates in adipose tissue as fat, resulting in obesity and other complications such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies have shed light on vitamin A metabolites; retinaldehyde and retinoic acid and participation of their pathway proteins in the regulation of adipose tissue metabolism and thus, obesity. In this context, we discuss here some of our important findings, which establish the role of vitamin A (supplementation) in obesity and its associated disorders by employing an obese rat model; WNIN/Ob strain.",Jeyakumar SM; Vajreswari A,The Indian journal of medical research,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25963488/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25961055,Beneficial effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated Fatty acids in gestational diabetes: consequences in macrosomia and adulthood obesity.,"Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are increasingly being used to prevent cardiovascular diseases, including diabetes and obesity. In this paper, we report data on the observed effects of omega-3 PUFA on major metabolic disorders and immune system disruption during gestational diabetes and their consequences on macrosomia. While controversies still exist about omega-3 PUFA effects on antioxidant status regarding the level of omega-3 PUFA in diet supplementation, their lipid-lowering effects are unanimously recognized by researchers. Animal studies have shown that omega-3 PUFA contributes to the maintenance of the immune defense system by promoting the differentiation of T helper (Th) cell to a Th2 phenotype in diabetic pregnancy and by shifting the Th1/Th2 ratio from a deleterious proinflammatory Th1 phenotype to a protective anti-inflammatory Th2 phenotype in macrosomia and in adulthood obesity that results from macrosomia at birth. Based on the available evidence, international nutritional and food agencies recommend administration of omega-3 PUFA as triglyceride-lowering agents, for the prevention of cardiovascular disease risk and during human pregnancy and lactation. Furthermore, studies targeting humans are still required to explore application of the fatty acids as supplement in the management of gestational diabetes and inflammatory and immune diseases.",Yessoufou A; Nekoua MP; Gbankoto A; Mashalla Y; Moutairou K,Journal of diabetes research,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25961055/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25960118,Clinical perspectives on the rationale for potassium supplementation.,"Hypokalemia is a common electrolyte disturbance, observed in > 20% of hospitalized patients. Hypokalemia, although not formally defined, is generally considered to be when serum potassium levels fall below the normal value of 3.6 mmol/L. In contrast to other electrolytes, potassium is primarily an intracellular ion: only 2% of all potassium in the body is present in the extracellular fluid, so a small decrease in serum potassium may represent a significant decrease in intracellular potassium. Individuals with mildly decreased potassium levels (3.0-3.5 mmol/L) may be asymptomatic, but patients with more pronounced decreases may report symptoms including muscle weakness, fatigue, and constipation. Very low serum potassium levels (≤ 2.5 mmol/L) can lead to muscle necrosis, paralysis, cardiac arrhythmias, and impaired respiration, which can be life-threatening. Absent comprehensive and robust treatment guidelines, strategies for the prevention or treatment of hypokalemia, such as how to diagnose hypokalemia, when to treat patients, what dosage regimen of potassium supplementation to use and for how long, are often based on the experience of the physician and empirical evidence. However, proper evaluation and treatment of hypokalemia in patients is essential because of associated morbidities. Because small potassium deficits in serum represent large body losses, potassium repletion requires substantial and prolonged supplementation. For patients with known risk factors for hypokalemia (e.g. hypertension, heart failure, or diabetes), careful monitoring is crucial to avoid the adverse sequelae associated with potassium deficits and to ensure that adequate and timely preventive measures can be taken. In this review, we provide practical insights into the etiology, differential diagnosis, and treatment of hypokalemia, including treatment strategies for patients with known risk factors.",Weir MR; Espaillat R,Postgraduate medicine,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25960118/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25952470,"Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Levels: Variability, Knowledge Gaps, and the Concept of a Desirable Range.","Hypovitaminosis D is prevalent worldwide but proportions vary widely between regions, depending on genetic and lifestyle factors, the threshold to define deficiency, and accuracy of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) assays used. Latitude, pollution, concealing clothing, sun exposure, gender, dietary habits, and lack of government regulation account for up to 50% in variations in serum 25OHD levels, whereas genetic polymorphisms in the vitamin D pathway account for less than 5%. Organizations/societies have developed guidelines for recommended desirable 25OHD levels and vitamin D doses to reach them, but their applicability across age groups and populations are still debated. This article and the accompanying online Supporting Information highlight sources of variations in circulating 25OHD levels, uncertainties and knowledge gaps, and analytical problems facing 25OHD assays, while keeping efficacy and safety data as the dominant factors when defining a desirable range for 25OHD levels. We propose a desirable range of 20 to 40 ng/mL (50 to 100 nmol/L), provided precise and accurate assays are used. Although slightly lower levels, 15 to 20 ng/mL, may be sufficient for some infants and adults, higher levels, 40 to 60 ng/mL, may still be safe. This desirable range allows physicians to tailor treatment while taking season, lifestyle, vitamin D intake, and other sources of variation into account. We reserve 25OHD measurements for at-risk patients, defined by disease or lifestyle, and the use of 25OHD assays calibrated against the recommended international standards. Most target groups reach desirable target levels by a daily intake of 400 to 600 IU for children and 800 IU for adults. A total daily allowance of vitamin D of up to 1000 IU in the pediatric age groups, and up to 2000 IU in adults, tailored to an individual patient risk profile, is probably safe over long durations. Additional data are needed to validate the proposed range and vitamin D doses, especially in children, pregnant women, and non-white populations.",Fuleihan Gel-H; Bouillon R; Clarke B; Chakhtoura M; Cooper C; McClung M; Singh RJ,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25952470/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25936871,Indications for Omega-3 Long Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid in the Prevention and Treatment of Cardiovascular Disease.,"The National Heart Foundation of Australia (NHFA) 2008 review on omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) made recommendations with respect to supplementation for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Since then, new findings have been published regarding the relationship between omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, including supplementation, and cardiovascular health. A literature search was undertaken in PubMed and Medline, for literature published between January 1, 2007 and August 31, 2013. A total of eight research questions were developed and, using the National Health and Medical Research Council's evidence assessment framework, conclusions were made in relation to dietary intake of fish and omega-3 LCPUFA for cardiovascular health. In the evidence published since 2007, this summary of evidence concludes that dietary intake of fish was found to be mostly consistent with respect to protection from heart disease and stroke. Higher fish intake was associated with lower incident rates of heart failure in addition to lower sudden cardiac death, stroke and myocardial infarction. In relation to omega-3 LCPUFA supplementation, neither a beneficial nor adverse effect was demonstrated in primary or secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD). Although the evidence continues to be positive for the role of omega-3 LCPUFA in the treatment of hypertriglyceridaemia and a modest positive benefit in heart failure.

25922082,Actions of Adjunctive Nutritional Antioxidants in Periodontitis and Prevalent Systemic Inflammatory Diseases.,"Common risk markers for periodontitis and prevalent systemic comorbidities indicate similarities in their progression and molecular mechanisms involved. Resultant pro-oxidant disease profiles provide scope for attenuating their pathogeneses with appropriate adjunctive antioxidants. Levels of oxidative stress markers 8-hydroxy-deoxguanosine (8-HOdG) and malondialdehyde (MDA) are significantly higher in periodontitis and other chronic inflammatory conditions. There is a clear link between periodontitis and diseases associated with significant systemic inflammatory loading, such as metabolic syndrome. Micro- and macro-nutrients have proven to be effective in curbing molecular mechanisms that generate reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. A Mediterranean diet rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grain, nuts, fish, olive oil and red wine in moderation, could be attributed to the lower occurrence of cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance and other inflammatory diseases in this region. A significant number of naturally occurring flavonoids have been identified in these products. Flavonoids comprising flavonols, flavones and isoflavones are potent free radical scavengers, effective in inhibiting lipid peroxidation, with anti-atherosclerotic and antihypertensive effects.The phenolic compound oleocanthal isolated in virgin olive oil has similar anti-inflammatory actions to that of ibuprofen. The anti-atherogenic effects of MUFA and PUFA in nuts, enhance endothelial function by reducing total cholesterol, oxidized LDL, hs-CRP, sVCAM-1 levels, lipids, lipoproteins and inflammatory markers. Epigenetics influenced by environmental factors and interactions between genes and nutrients, are important considerations in influencing these effects. Using antioxidants as therapeutic adjuncts could enhance the antioxidant capacity of an inherent glutathione system and overcome oxidative effects, thereby mitigating therapeutic side-effects.",El-Shinnawi U; Soory M,"Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25922082/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease with multiple metabolic abnormalities, principally resulting from the inflammation and oxidative stress associated with mitochondrial dysfunctions.

We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to assess the effects of CoQ10 supplementation on glycaemic control, lipid profile and blood pressure in patients with diabetes. A systematic search was conducted on MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, CINAHL, NCCAM, Web of Science, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov and historical search of reference lists of relevant articles. The bibliographic databases were searched from inception to February 2015. We included randomized, placebo-controlled trials of CoQ10 in diabetes lasting at least 12 weeks. HbA1c or fasting plasma glucose had to be reported. Primary outcome was glycemic control, and secondary outcomes were lipid profile and blood pressure. Treatment effect was estimated with mean difference. Seven trials were included in the meta-analysis, involving 356 patients. Neither CoQ10 alone nor CoQ10 plus fenofibrate improved glycemic control. In addition, CoQ10, alone or in combination with fenofibrate, did not alter LDL-C, HDL-C and blood pressure. Triglycerides levels were significantly reduced with CoQ10 (mean difference -0·26 mmol/L, 95% CI -0·05 mmol/L to -0·47 mmol/L, P = 0·02) and CoQ10 plus fenofibrate (mean difference -0·72 mmol/L, 95% CI -0·32 mmol/L to -1·12 mmol/L, P = 0·0004). CoQ10 plus fenofibrate also effectively reduced total cholesterol (mean difference: -0·45 mmol/L, 95% CI -0·06 mmol/L to -0·84 mmol/L, P = 0·02). CoQ10 supplementation has no beneficial effects on glycemic control, lipid profile or blood pressure in patients with diabetes. However, it may reduce triglycerides levels. Due to limited data availability, well-powered and well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to clearly determine the effect of CoQ10 on metabolic profile in diabetes. Dosage effects should also be explored.",Suksomboon N; Poolsup N; Juanak N,Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25913756/,0,1,0,1,0,0
25892959,Modulation of glucose transporter protein by dietary flavonoids in type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia due to insufficient or inefficient insulin secretory response. This chronic disease is a global problem and there is a need for greater emphasis on therapeutic strategies in the health system. Phytochemicals such as flavonoids have recently attracted attention as source materials for the development of new antidiabetic drugs or alternative therapy for the management of diabetes and its related complications. The antidiabetic potential of flavonoids are mainly through their modulatory effects on glucose transporter by enhancing GLUT-2 expression in pancreatic β cells and increasing expression and promoting translocation of GLUT-4 via PI3K/AKT, CAP/Cb1/TC10 and AMPK pathways. This review highlights the recent findings on beneficial effects of flavonoids in the management of diabetes with particular emphasis on the investigations that explore the role of these compounds in modulating glucose transporter proteins at cellular and molecular level.",Hajiaghaalipour F; Khalilpourfarshbafi M; Arya A,International journal of biological sciences,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25892959/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25871295,Anti-obesity activity of the marine carotenoid fucoxanthin.,"Nowadays the global tendency towards physical activity reduction and an augmented dietary intake of fats, sugars and calories is leading to a growing propagation of overweight, obesity and lifestyle-related diseases, such diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome. In particular, obesity, characterized as a state of low-level inflammation, is a powerful determinant both in the development of insulin resistance and in the progression to type 2 diabetes. A few molecular targets offer hope for anti-obesity therapeutics. One of the keys to success could be the induction of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) and the regulation of cytokine secretions from both abdominal adipose cells and macrophage cells infiltrated into adipose tissue. Anti-obesity effects of fucoxanthin, a characteristic carotenoid, exactly belonging to xanthophylls, have been reported. Nutrigenomic studies reveal that fucoxanthin induces UCP1 in abdominal WAT mitochondria, leading to the oxidation of fatty acids and heat production in WAT. Fucoxanthin improves insulin resistance and decreases blood glucose levels through the regulation of cytokine secretions from WAT. The key structure of anti-obesity effect is suggested to be the carotenoid end of the polyene chromophore, which contains an allenic bond and two hydroxyl groups. Fucoxanthin, which can be isolated from edible brown seaweeds, recently displayed its many physiological functions and biological properties. We reviewed recent studies and this article aims to explain essential background of fucoxanthin, focusing on its promising potential anti-obesity effects. In this respect, fucoxanthin can be developed into promising marine drugs and nutritional products, in order to become a helpful functional food.",Gammone MA; D'Orazio N,Marine drugs,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25871295/,1,0,0,0,0,0

25864185,Obesity and Clinical Riskiness Relationship: Therapeutic Management by Dietary Antioxidant Supplementation--a Review.,"Obesity is a global health problem affecting all age groups, leading to many complications such as type 2 diabetes, systemic hypertension, cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and stroke. Physiologically, obesity arises from metabolic changes in the tissues and organs of the human body; these changes result in an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure, which in turn results in increased fat accumulation in adipose tissue. Such fat accumulation predisposes individuals to development of several health problems. Two different obesity treatment drugs are currently on the market; Orlistat, which reduces intestinal fat absorption via inhibiting pancreatic lipase, and Sibutramine, an anorectic or appetite suppressant. Both drugs have hazardous side effects, including increased blood pressure, dry mouth, constipation, headache, and insomnia. For this reason, a wide variety of natural materials have been explored for their obesity treatment potential. Therefore, the present review focuses on the safety and efficacy of some herbal medicines in the management of obesity through covering their beneficial effects and mechanism of action.",Hassan HA; El-Gharib NE,Applied biochemistry and biotechnology,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25864185/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25862787,ENDOCRINOLOGY IN PREGNANCY: Influence of maternal vitamin D status on obstetric outcomes and the fetal skeleton.,"Vitamin D status has been increasingly associated with wide-ranging clinical outcomes. There is now a wealth of observational studies reporting on its associations with obstetric complications, including pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes and the mode and timing of delivery. The findings are inconsistent, and currently there is a lack of data from high-quality intervention studies to confirm a causal role for vitamin D in these outcomes. This is similarly true with regards to fetal development, including measures of fetal size and skeletal mineralisation. Overall, there is an indication of possible benefits of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy for offspring birthweight, calcium concentrations and bone mass as well as for reduced maternal pre-eclampsia. However, for none of these outcomes is the current evidence base conclusive, and the available data justify the instatement of high-quality randomised placebo controlled trials in a range of populations and health care settings to establish the potential efficacy and safety of vitamin D supplementation to improve particular outcomes.",Moon RJ; Harvey NC; Cooper C,European journal of endocrinology,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25862787/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25862325,"[Vitamin D, determinant of bone and extrabone health. Importance of vitamin D supplementation in milk and dairy products].","Vitamin D is obtained mainly from ultraviolet irradiation of 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin to form cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), and minimally from diet, unless vitamin D fortified food is taken, mainly enriched milk. In some countries, vitamin D is added to diet as ergocalciferol (vitamin D2). In the liver, vitamin D3 is hydroxylated to form 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (marker of body nutritional status of vitamin D). Subsequently, in the kidney, 25OHD3 is hydroxylated to form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3). By VDR stimulation, (1,25)OH)2D3 controls calcium homeostasis and bone health and, what is more, many other cells and tissues including skin, muscle, cardiovascular and immune systems as well as glucose homeostasis. Thus, about 3% of the human genome is regulated by this hormone. Association and recent intervention studies describe beneficial effects on bone, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2,colorectal cancer, breast cancer, multiple sclerosis, immune function inflammation etc. A minimum target for public health should be to achieve serum 25OHD levels above 20 ng/ml to ensure optimum status for bone health. However, levels above 30 ng/ml should be reached to achieve other health goals. Paradoxically, inadequacy (or even deficiency) in vitamin D levels is highly prevalent in children and youth in Spain. This deficit persists in adults, as well as in postmenopausal women (osteoporotic or not) and the elderly (especially amongst those institutionalized). Seasonal variation barely normalizes serum 25OHD levels after summer-autumn. Treated postmenopausal osteoporotic women also show high prevalence of inadequate levels of vitamin D, a major contributor to antiresortive treatments failure. A normalization of serum vitamin D enables diet to provide the calcium necessary to achieve a good bone health and an adequate response to antiresortive drugs. Given the difficulty to get adequate levels of vitamin D by UV irradiation and diet, a proper supplementation of milk with vitamin D is an attractive chance and a challenge for Public Health of Spain and the European Union. It has provided excellent results in the US, Canada, Northern Europe Countries, etc.",Navarro Valverde C; Quesada Gómez JM,Nutricion hospitalaria,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25862325/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25813278,Effect of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy on maternal and neonatal outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"To assess the effects of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy on obstetric outcomes and birth variables. Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Not applicable. Pregnant women and neonates. PubMed and 5 other research databases were searched through March 2014 for RCTs evaluating vitamin D supplementation ± calcium/vitamins/ferrous sulfate vs. a control (placebo or active) during pregnancy. Measures were: circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), small for gestational age (SGA), low birth weight, preterm birth, birth weight, birth length, cesarean section. Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effects models were used, owing to expected scarcity of outcomes. Effects were reported as relative risks and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Thirteen RCTs (n = 2,299) were selected. Circulating 25(OH)D levels were significantly higher at term, compared with the control group (mean difference: 66.5 nmol/L, 95% CI 66.2-66.7). Birth weight and birth length were significantly greater for neonates in the vitamin D group; mean difference: 107.6 g (95% CI 59.9-155.3 g) and 0.3 cm (95% CI 0.10-0.41 cm), respectively. Incidence of preeclampsia, GDM, SGA, low birth weight, preterm birth, and cesarean section were not influenced by vitamin D supplementation. Across RCTs, the doses and types of vitamin D supplements, gestational age at first administration, and outcomes were heterogeneous. Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy was associated with increased circulating 25(OH)D levels, birth weight, and birth length, and was not associated with other maternal and neonatal outcomes.

25791371,How effective are antioxidant supplements in obesity and diabetes?,"Obesity is a central health issue due to its epidemic prevalence and its association with type 2 diabetes and other comorbidities. Obesity is not just being overweight. It is a metabolic disorder due to the accumulation of excess dietary calories into visceral fat and the release of high concentrations of free fatty acids into various organs. It represents a state of chronic oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation whose intermediary molecules may include leptin, adiponectin and cytokines. It may progress to hyperglycemia, leading to type 2 diabetes. Whether or not dietary antioxidant supplements are useful in the management of obesity and type 2 diabetes is discussed in this review. Only the benefits for obesity and diabetes are examined here. Other health benefits of antioxidants are not considered. There are difficulties in comparing studies in this field because they differ in the time frame, participants' ethnicity, administration of antioxidant supplements, and even in how obesity was measured. However, the literature presents reasonable evidence for marginal benefits of supplementation with zinc, lipoic acid, carnitine, cinnamon, green tea, and possibly vitamin C plus E, although the evidence is much weaker for omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, green coffee, resveratrol, or lycopene. Overall, antioxidant supplements are not a panacea to compensate for a fast-food and video-game way of living, but antioxidant-rich foods are recommended as part of the lifestyle. Such antioxidant foods are commonly available.",Abdali D; Samson SE; Grover AK,"Medical principles and practice : international journal of the Kuwait University, Health Science Centre",2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25791371/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25747270,Walnuts (Juglans regia) Chemical Composition and Research in Human Health.,"Walnuts are among the most widely consumed commercially grown tree nuts in the world. Many health benefits have been claimed for the consumption of these, including reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, type II diabetes treatment, and prevention and treatment of certain cancers, and the lessening of symptoms attributed to age-related and other neurological disorders. The health-promoting benefits of walnut consumption are ascribed to its fatty acid profile, which is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids with a particularly high ω3:ω6 ratio-the highest among all the tree nuts. The content of polyphenols and other phytochemicals in walnuts, with their claimed cytotoxic properties, also make them an attractive candidate for research for the prevention of free radical-induced nucleic acid damage. Research of walnut consumption in humans and animals employing a range of data sets and statistical methods suggest that walnuts may be considered a safe potential nutraceutical or possibly pharmaceutical substance. Nevertheless, few reviews of scientific research on the proposed benefits of these nuts exist, in spite of the numerous claims attributed to them in the lay media. This brief review article attempts to disseminate much of the information surrounding walnut consumption, and human health benefits, to other scientists and the interested general reader.",Hayes D; Angove MJ; Tucci J; Dennis C,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25747270/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25746842,Nutritional intervention and impact of polyphenol on glycohemoglobin (HbA1c) in non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic subjects: Systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Polyphenols have been extensively studied for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Recently, their antiglycative actions by oxidative stress modulation have been linked to the prevention of diabetes and associated complications. This article assesses the evidence for polyphenol interventions on glycohemoglobin (HbA1c) in non-diabetic, pre-diabetic, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) subjects. A systematic review of polyphenols' clinical trials on HbA1c in humans was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Thirty-six controlled randomized trials with HbA1c values were included. Polyphenols (extracts, supplements, and foods) were supplemented (28 mg to 1.5 g) for 0.7 to 12 months. Combining all subjects (n = 1954, mean baseline HbA1c = 7.03%, 53 mmol/mol), polyphenol supplementation significantly (P < 0.001) lowered HbA1c% by -0.53 ± 0.12 units (-5.79 ± 0.13 mmol/mol). This reduction was significant (P < 0.001) in T2DM subjects, specifically (n = 1426, mean baseline HbA1c = 7.44%, 58 mmol/mol), with HbA1c% lowered by -0.21 ± 0.04 units (-2.29 ± 0.4 mmol/mol). Polyphenol supplementation had no significant effect (P > 0.21) in the non-diabetic (n = 258, mean baseline HbA1c = 5.47%, 36 mmol/mol) and the pre-diabetic subjects (n = 270, mean baseline HbA1c = 6.06%, 43 mmol/mol) strata: -0.39 ± 0.27 HbA1c% units (-4.3 ± 0.3 mmol/mol), and -0.38 ± 0.31 units (-4.2 ± 0.31 mmol/mol), respectively. In conclusion, polyphenols can successfully reduce HbA1c in T2DM without any intervention at glycemia, and could contribute to the prevention of diabetes complications.",Palma-Duran SA; Vlassopoulos A; Lean M; Govan L; Combet E,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25746842/,0,1,0,1,0,0
25734565,Emphasizing the health benefits of vitamin D for those with neurodevelopmental disorders and intellectual disabilities.,"People with neurodevelopmental disorders and intellectual disabilities have much greater health care needs. Mainly staying indoors, such people generally have low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations. The Vitamin D Task Force of the American Academy of Developmental Medicine and Dentistry (AADMD) reviewed the evidence of 25(OH)D concentrations that benefit the health of persons with developmental disabilities. Maintaining recommended optimal serum 25(OH)D concentrations year long will benefit skeletal development in infants, children, and adolescents, and benefit musculoskeletal health and neuromuscular coordination in adult patients, and decrease risk of falls. Maintaining optimal concentrations decreases risks and severities of autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular disease, many types of cancer, dementia, types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus, and respiratory tract infections. Other benefits include improved dental and oral health and improved physical performance. The Task Force recommends that 25(OH)D concentrations for optimal health to be in the range of 75 to 125 nmol/L, which can be achieved using between 800 and 4000 IU/day vitamin D3 and sensible exposure to solar UVB radiation.

25729475,"Recent advances in dietary supplementation, in treating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.","Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently known as the most common liver problem, characterized by excessive lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, which may progress to other liver diseases such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, hepatic tissue fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, and failure or hepatocellular carcinoma. Since NAFLD is positively associated with the development of obesity, insulin resistance, and ultimately type 2 diabetes mellitus, it is often regarded as the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. No pharmacologic treatment has yet been proven for this disease. For most patients with presumed or confirmed NAFLD, the only proven strategy is to offer lifestyle advice that can lead to sustained weight loss. Since insulin resistance, oxidative stress, inflammation, and necro-apoptosis are involved in NAFLD pathogenesis, it seems that every potential therapeutic agent should target one or some of these pathologic events. There are many well known anti-oxidants, anti-inflammatory, and insulin sensitizer dietary supplements which have shown beneficial effects on NAFLD improvement in animal and human studies. The purpose of this review is to explore the existing evidences on dietary supplements considered to have hepatoprotective properties, and to present some proposed mechanisms by which they may protect against NAFLD.",Eslamparast T; Eghtesad S; Poustchi H; Hekmatdoost A,World journal of hepatology,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25729475/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25714787,Vitamin D and cardiometabolic risk factors and diseases.,"Obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are the most common preventable causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Insulin resistance, which is a shared feature in these conditions, is also strongly linked to the development of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is the most common endocrine disease in women of reproductive age and a major cause of infertility. Vitamin D deficiency has reached epidemic proportions worldwide, primarily due to the shift to sedentary, indoor lifestyles and sun avoidance behaviours to protect against skin cancer. In recent years, vitamin D deficiency has been implicated in the aetiology of type 2 diabetes, PCOS and CVD, and has been shown to be associated with their risk factors including obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, as well as chronic low-grade inflammation. Treating vitamin D deficiency may offer a feasible and cost-effective means of reducing cardiometabolic risk factors at a population level in order to prevent the development of type 2 diabetes and CVD. However, not all intervention studies show that vitamin D supplementation alleviates these risk factors. Importantly, there is significant heterogeneity in existing studies with regards to doses and drug regimens used, populations studied (i.e. vitamin D deficient or sufficient), and the lengths of supplementation, and only few studies have directly examined the effect of vitamin D on insulin secretion and resistance with the use of clamp methods.

25707985,Possible abilities of dietary factors to prevent and treat diabetes via the stimulation of glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion.,"There is a pressing need for countermeasures against diabetes, which has increased in incidence, becoming a global issue. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a molecule secreted in enteroendocrine L cells in the lower small and large intestines, is thought to be one of the most important molecular targets for the prevention and treatment of diabetes. There has been increasing interest in the possible ability of dietary factors to treat diabetes via modulating GLP-1 secretion. There is thought to be a close relationship between incretin and diet, and the purported best approach for using dietary factors to increase GLP-1 activity is promotion of secretion of endogenous GLP-1. It have been reported that nutrients as well as various non-nutrient dietary factors can function as GLP-1 secretogogues. Here, we present our findings on the GLP-1 secretion-stimulating functions of two dietary factors, curcumin and extract of edible sweet potato leaves, which contain caffeoylquinic acid derivatives. However, it is necessary to reveal in greater detail the stimulation of GLP-1 secretion by dietary factors for preventing and treating diabetes.

Data from epidemiological and association studies clearly indicate a correlation between vitamin D deficiency and a higher prevalence of both forms of diabetes. In animal models, vitamin D deficiency predisposes to type 1 and type 2 diabetes, whereas high doses of vitamin D or its active hormonal form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, prevent disease. Large scale, randomized, blinded prospective studies however, remain lacking. Here we discuss the current literature on a role for vitamin D in diabetes. We propose, in particular, to avoid vitamin D deficiency in individuals at risk of developing T1D or T2D. Applying international guidelines on supplementation of vitamin D using small daily doses of vitamin D (500-1000IU) may contribute to reduce the burden of diabetes by preventing vitamin D deficiency.

25697289,Vitamin D and risk of CVD: a review of the evidence.,"This review summarises evidence for an association between vitamin D status and CVD and the mechanisms involved. Vitamin D3 is predominantly provided by the action of UVB from sunlight on skin. Average UK diets supply 2-3 μg/d vitamin D but diets containing at least one portion of oily fish per week supply about 7 μg/d. Pharmacological doses of vitamin D2 (bolus injection of 7500 μg or intakes >50 μg/d) result in a smaller increase in plasma 25(OH)D than those of D3 but physiological doses 5-25 μg/d seem equivalent. Plasma 25(OH)D concentrations are also influenced by clothing, obesity and skin pigmentation. Up to 40 % of the population have plasma 25(OH)D concentrations <25 nmol/l in the winter compared with <10 % in the summer. The relative risk of CVD death is 1·41 (95 % CI 1·18, 1·68) greater in the lowest quintile of plasma 25(OH)D according to meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies. Acute deficiency may inhibit insulin secretion and promote inflammation thus increasing the risk of plaque rupture and arterial thrombosis. Chronic insufficiency may increase arterial stiffness. There is no evidence to support claims of reduced CVD from existing trials with bone-related health outcomes where vitamin D was usually co-administered with calcium. Although several trials with cardiovascular endpoints are in progress, these are using pharmacological doses. In view of the potential toxicity of pharmacological doses, there remains a need for long-term trials of physiological doses of D2 and D3 with CVD incidence as the primary outcome.",Fry CM; Sanders TA,The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25697289/,1,0,0,0,0,1
25689396,Effects of tea or tea extract on metabolic profiles in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis of ten randomized controlled trials.,"As consumption of tea has been confirmed as a protective factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), it would be interesting to know if T2DM patients could benefit from tea. Because of small sample sizes and inconsistent results of previous studies, we performed this meta-analysis to reevaluate the effects of tea or tea extract on all available outcomes in patients with T2DM. We systematically searched electronic databases of PubMed, Cochrane Library and EMBASE to identify randomized controlled trials of tea in T2DM patients up to January 2015. Weight mean differences for the changes in all outcomes were pooled by Review Manager 5.2 (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, England). A total of ten trials including 608 subjects were identified. The meta-analysis found that tea could alleviate the decrease of fasting blood insulin [1.30 U/L, 95% CI (0.36, 2.24)], and reduced waist circumference only in more than 8-week intervention [-2.70 cm, 95% CI (-4.72, -0.69)], whereas there were no statistically significant differences with regard to homeostasis model of insulin resistance 0.38 (-0.18, 0.95), fasting blood glucose -0.05 mmol/L (-0.51, 0.40), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol 0.07 mmol/L (-0.15, 0.29), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol 0.01 mmol/L (-0.08, 0.09), body mass index -0.15 kg/m(2) (-0.50, 0.21), SBP 0.35 mmHg (-3.54, 4.24), DBP -1.02 mmHg (-3.53, 1.48), triglycerides -0.11 mmol/L (-0.28, 0.05) and fasting cholesterol -0.05 mmol/L (-0.20, 0.11) in patients with T2DM, and leptin, ADPN, CRE and UA were also non-significant. The intervention of tea or tea extraction could maintain a stable fasting blood insulin and reduce waist circumference in the T2DM patients; however, the effects on other outcomes were not significant.

25638207,Strategic nutrition: a vision for the twenty-first century.,"It is now widely accepted that poor nutrition plays a major role in the epidemic of various diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes and CVD. There has also been much research regarding the role of related factors such as advertising and food prices. Many intervention studies have been carried out where attempts have been made to persuade people to modify their behaviour, such as by making dietary changes, in order to enhance health (health promotion). There has also been much debate on the potential of government policy as a tool for achieving these goals. Various proposals have been made, such as a tax on sugary drinks, the redirection of food subsidies and how the salt content of food can be reduced. However, the great majority of previous papers have considered only single aspects of the topics discussed here. The present paper reviews strategies for improving public health, both health promotion interventions and the use of government policy approaches. Topics discussed include providing advice for the general population and the design of food guides and food labels. This leads to the conclusion that we need an overall strategy that integrates this diverse body of information and formulates a comprehensive action plan. I propose the term 'strategic nutrition'. The implementation of this plan opens up a path to a major advance in public health.",Temple NJ,Public health nutrition,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25638207/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25636723,Vitamin D and health: the need for more randomized controlled trials.,"The importance of vitamin D for calcium absorption and bone health is undisputed. In addition, vitamin D may also be important for more than the skeleton as low serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) have been associated with a number of diseases like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer and infections. This is mainly based on observational studies and proof of causal relations from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are lacking. At present several large RCTs including from 2152 to 25,000 subjects and with cardiovascular disease and cancer as endpoints are ongoing. Results are expected within 3-5 years, and hopefully these studies will give us a definite answer on need for vitamin D supplementation. However, since vitamin D deficiency (serum 25(OH)D <50nmol/L) has not been an inclusion criterion in these studies, there is a risk of a null effect. If so, one has to establish the effects of vitamin D in truly vitamin D deficient subjects, studies that in retrospect obviously should have been the starting point for RCTs on vitamin D and health.

However, there is no consistent evidence of an increased protection against metabolic disorders and other ailments when comparing studies in laboratory animals and humans. A number of extraneous and potential confounding variables can affect the outcome of clinical research. To date, most of the studies that have investigated the effect of resveratrol administration on patient outcomes have been limited by their sample sizes. In this review, we will survey the latest advances regarding the timing, dosage, formulation, bioavailability, toxicity of resveratrol, and resveratrol-drug interactions in human studies. Moreover, the present report focuses on the actions of resveratrol treatment in combating diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease, and other age-related ailments.",Novelle MG; Wahl D; Diéguez C; Bernier M; de Cabo R,Ageing research reviews,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25625901/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25606815,Dietary Antioxidants as Modifiers of Physiologic Adaptations to Exercise.,"Adaptive responses to exercise training (ET) are crucial in maintaining physiologic homeostasis and health span. Exercise-induced aerobic bioenergetic reactions in the mitochondria and cytosol increase production of reactive oxygen species, where excess of reactive oxygen species can be scavenged by enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants (AO) to protect against deleterious oxidative stress. Free radicals, however, have recently been recognized as crucial signaling agents that promote adaptive mechanisms to ET, such as mitochondrial biogenesis, AO enzyme activity defense system upregulation, insulin sensitivity, and glucose uptake in the skeletal muscle. Commonly used nonenzymatic AO supplements, such as vitamins C and E, α-lipoic acid, and polyphenols, in combination with ET, have been proposed as ways to prevent exercise-induced oxidative stress and hence improve adaptation responses to endurance training. During the PubMed search, we selected studies that examined and compared ET effects with and without administration of commonly used AO supplements. Preclinical and clinical studies to date have shown inconsistent results indicating either positive or negative effects of endurance training combined with different blends of AO supplements (mostly vitamins C and E and α-lipoic acid) on redox status, mitochondrial biogenesis pathways, and insulin sensitivity. Preclinical reports on ET combined with resveratrol, however, have shown consistent positive effects on exercise performance, mitochondrial biogenesis, and insulin sensitivity, with clinical trials reporting mixed effects. Relevant clinical studies have been few and have used inconsistent results and methodology (types of compounds, combinations, and supplementation time). The future studies should investigate the effects of specific AO and other popular supplements, such as α-lipoic acid and resveratrol, on training effects in humans. Of particular importance are older adults who may be at higher risk of age-related increased oxidative stress, an impaired AO enzyme defense system, and comorbidities such as hypertension, insulin resistance, and diabetes.",Mankowski RT; Anton SD; Buford TW; Leeuwenburgh C,Medicine and science in sports and exercise,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25606815/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25603446,Suitability of Different Food Grade Materials for the Encapsulation of Some Functional Foods Well Reported for Their Advantages and Susceptibility.,"Functional foods find a very important place in the modern era, where different types of cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, etc. are on a high. Irrespective of the abundance of bioactive components in different fruits and vegetables, their low solubility in aqueous solution, vulnerability to destruction in different environmental and gastrointestinal conditions and a low intestinal absorption becomes a concern. Because it is quite difficult to commercialize non food materials for the food encapsulation purposes due to their safety concerns in the human body, scientists in the recent times have come up with the idea of encapsulating the different bioactive components in different food grade materials that are able to safeguard these bioactive components against the different environmental and gastrointestinal conditions and ensure their safe and targeted delivery at their absorption sites. Different food grade encapsulation materials including various oligosaccharides, polysaccharides (starch, cyclodextrins, alginates, chitosan, gum arabic, and carboxymethyl cellulose) and proteins and their suitability for encapsulating various bioactive components like flavonoids (catechins, rutin, curcumin, hesperetin, and vanillin), nonflavonoids (resveratrol), carotenoids (β-carotene, lycopene, and lutein), and fatty acids (fish oil, flaxseed oil, and olive oil) of high medical and nutritional value are reviewed here.",Wani TA; Shah AG; Wani SM; Wani IA; Masoodi FA; Nissar N; Shagoo MA,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25603446/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25589711,[The use of various diet supplements in metabolic syndrome].,"Civilization development is associated with immense progress in science and significant improvement of human living conditions but simultaneously it contributes to many health problems including metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is a set of mutually associated factors including insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, obesity, lipids disorders and hypertension, which is the main cause of development of coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes. The first line of defense against metabolic syndrome is a change of life style including body mass reduction, application of a low-calorie diet and performance of physical activity. In spite of the simplicity of therapy, long-term success of the above treatment among patients is observed seldom because it is very difficult to obey rigorous rules. Nowadays, it is considered that diet supplements including antioxidants, polyunsaturated fatty acids and mineral elements are helpful in metabolic syndrome treatment due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It is considered that a health balanced diet enriched with various diet supplements may be the best strategy in metabolic syndrome treatment.",Sicińska P; Pytel E; Maćczak A; Koter-Michalak M,Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25589711/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25580706,Omega-3-carboxylic acid (Epanova) for hypertriglyceridemia.,"Hypertriglyceridemia is a prevalent yet under-addressed condition, often seen in association with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, obesity, and physical inactivity. The control of triglyceride (TG) levels is essential to prevent the development of coronary artery disease and pancreatitis associated with hypertriglyceridemia. Omega-3-carboxylic acid (Epanova) is the third prescription omega-3 fatty acid product approved in the United States as an adjunct to diet for treating severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL). At the approved dosage, it reduced baseline serum TG levels by 25-30% in a placebo-controlled study. It reduced serum TG levels by an additional 8-15% in patients who were already taking statin therapy. It appeared to have a better bioavailability profile compared with an equivalent dose of omega-3-acid ethyl ester (Lovaza) in both low-fat and high-fat diets. However, evidence behind the effects of omega-3-carboxylic acid on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and pancreatitis risk, is lacking. Overall, it is well tolerated, but may induce common gastrointestinal side effects, such as abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. At this time, omega-3-carboxylic acid is an alternative adjunct therapy (in addition to diet) for hypertriglyceridemia. Its potential clinical benefits over other omega-3 formulations have yet to be evaluated.",Zhao A; Lam S,Cardiology in review,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25580706/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25579434,Influence of ascorbic acid supplementation on type 2 diabetes mellitus in observational and randomized controlled trials; a systematic review with meta-analysis.,"There are controversial data regarding the beneficial effects of ascorbic acid (AA) supplementation in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this systematic review, we aimed to criticize the current relevant data from both observational and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). All observational and RCTs conducted to assess anti-hyperglycemic effects of AA in diabetics, published before January 2013, were included. To obtain all related studies Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, IranMedex, and Magiran web databases were searched. Exclusion criteria were animal studies, and studies conducted in Type 1 DM, children or pregnant women. Main outcome measures were fasting blood sugar (FBS), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). According to degree of heterogeneity, fixed or random effect models were employed. Meta-analyses were done using Stats Direct software, version 3.0.97. The quality of included articles and publication bias were also assessed. We selected 38 articles; 26 observational studies and 12 RCTs. Due to severe methodological heterogeneity in all observational studies and some of RCTs, we could pool data from only 5 RCTs in a meta-analysis. Single intake of AA versus placebo showed a significant effect on FBS; with the standardized mean difference (SMD): -20.59, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI): -40.77 to -0.4 (p= 0.04), but non-significant effect on HbA1c; SMD: -0.46, 95% CI: -1.75 to 0.84 (p= 0.4). Effect of other antioxidants with/without AA supplementation on FBSwere nonsignificant; SMD: -4.26 (p= 0.8), and SMD: -12.04 (p= 0.3), respectively. Also, their effect on HbA1c was non-significant; SMD: 0.53 (p= 0.11), and SMD: 0.28 (p= 0.34), respectively. Our study supports the positive effect of AA in reduction of FBS in diabetics, however, due to insufficient evidence ragarding long term safety of AA supplementation and limited number of RCTs, the long term use of this vitamin for its anti-diabetic properties cannot be strongly recommended.",Tabatabaei-Malazy O; Nikfar S; Larijani B; Abdollahi M,"Journal of pharmacy & pharmaceutical sciences : a publication of the Canadian Society for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Societe canadienne des sciences pharmaceutiques",2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25579434/,0,1,0,1,0,0
25573654,Vitamin D supplementation and health-related quality of life: a systematic review of the literature.,"Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are highly prevalent worldwide and thought to potentiate a variety of chronic disease states, including diabetes, cancer, and depression. Routine vitamin D supplementation is often needed to meet vitamin D requirements. Little is known regarding the effect of vitamin D supplementation on quality of life. The purpose of this article was to systematically review the literature regarding quality-of-life outcomes from vitamin D supplementation in healthy and clinical populations. Clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation, where quality-of-life outcomes were reported, were selected from Medline and Web of Science databases. Inclusion criteria were English language articles available online (published between 1950 and May 2014), primary research articles, studies conducted on human beings, and treatment/supplementation with vitamin D. Articles were excluded if they involved topical vitamin D application or implicit cotreatment with other vitamins (eg, multivitamins). Articles selected for review were examined for process and methodologic quality using validated methodologies. A total of 15 articles met the inclusion criteria for review. Interventions were highly variable in terms of study population (eg, healthy/diseased, children/elderly, and baseline vitamin D status) vitamin D dose, and duration of follow-up. Vitamin D supplementation ranged from 400 IU/day for an average of 7.1 years, to a single 300, 000 IU dose. The main tools used to capture quality of life were adaptations of validated, questionnaires (Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36-item questionnaire and EuroQOL five dimension questionnaire). Vitamin D supplementation was not associated with significant changes in quality of life. Studies that reported changes in quality of life as a result of vitamin D supplementation were in clinical populations on short-term vitamin D. Most articles reviewed displayed poor methodologic quality (eg, no randomization/blinding, dropout description, or vitamin D assessment). Current evidence indicates that vitamin D supplementation may have a small to moderate effect on quality of life when used on a short-term basis in diseased populations. However, the evidence for a beneficial effect of long-term vitamin D supplementation on health-related quality of life is lacking.",Hoffmann MR; Senior PA; Mager DR,Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25573654/,0,1,0,0,0,1

A literature search was conducted via EMBASE and Medline and identified 14 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 2 meta-analyses reporting on effects of combined supplementation with CaD on CV events, CV death, blood pressure, lipids, glucose metabolism and weight. Overall, the existing evidence does not support beneficial properties of supplementation with CaD on the CV system, nor does it suggest that a re-appraisal of the use of CaD is necessary due to adverse effects, although increased risk of CV events has been reported by some authors. The guidelines for the use of CaD supplementation need not change until well-conducted RCTs that have CV effects as primary outcomes and adjust for major confounders indicate otherwise.",Challoumas D; Stavrou A; Pericleous A; Dimitrakakis G,Atherosclerosis,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25558033/,1,0,0,0,0,0

In light of the staggering financial/human cost of type 2 diabetes, there is considerable need for safe and effective agents that can be used to prevent and/or adjunctively treat the disease. Available evidence suggests that a number of natural supplements, including cinnamon, biotin, fenugreek, ginseng, banaba, and alpha-lipoic acid, have the potential to reduce the risk for type 2 diabetes in the large at-risk population. The evidence also suggests that, when used adjunctively, these natural products are likely to help clinicians achieve optimal glycemic control, improve long-term prognosis, and/or minimize the need for insulin therapy in type 2 diabetics.

25534981,"Advancing beyond the ""heart-healthy diet"" for peripheral arterial disease.","Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a burdensome cardiovascular condition that results from chronic inflammatory insults to the arterial vasculature. Key risk factors include age, gender, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, smoking, lack of physical fitness, and poor diet, the latter three being modifiable in the development and progression of PAD. A growing body of evidence indicates that imbalanced nutrient intake may contribute to the development and progression of PAD. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge about nutritional patterns among patients with PAD and to ascertain whether certain health-promoting foods and nutrients could benefit patients with this condition. We conducted a comprehensive literature review to examine primary source evidence for or against the nutrients that are commonly associated with PAD and their potential utility as therapies. We summarized nine categories of nutrients, as well as four diets endorsed by the American Heart Association that may be prescribed to patients with or at risk for PAD. The nutrients reviewed included omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), folate and B-series vitamins, and antioxidants. The diet plans described include the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, Mediterranean diet, low-fat diet, low carbohydrate diet, Dr Dean Ornish's Spectrum Diet and Dr Andrew Weil's Anti-Inflammatory Diet.

25528960,Impact of DHA on metabolic diseases from womb to tomb.,"Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) are important mediators in improving and maintaining human health over the total lifespan. One topic we especially focus on in this review is omega-3 LC-PUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Adequate DHA levels are essential during neurodevelopment and, in addition, beneficial in cognitive processes throughout life. We review the impact of DHA on societal relevant metabolic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM). All of these are risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia in later life. DHA supplementation is associated with a reduced incidence of both stroke and atherosclerosis, lower bodyweight and decreased T2DM prevalence. These findings are discussed in the light of different stages in the human life cycle: childhood, adolescence, adulthood and in later life. From this review, it can be concluded that DHA supplementation is able to inhibit pathologies like obesity and cardiovascular disease. DHA could be a dietary protector against these metabolic diseases during a person's entire lifespan. However, supplementation of DHA in combination with other dietary factors is also effective. The efficacy of DHA depends on its dose as well as on the duration of supplementation, sex, and age.",Arnoldussen IA; Kiliaan AJ,Marine drugs,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25528960/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25526571,Health outcomes of vitamin D. Part II. Role in prevention of diseases.,"Apart from the classic role of vitamin D, its hormonal active form, calcitriol is also characterized by pleiotropic effects on various organs and tissues. For the last several years, many researchers have shown an association between deficiency of vitamin D and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Recent investigations suggested the need of vitamin D supplementation in T2DM prevention. It was shown that vitamin D deficiency decreases insulin secretion. It was also observed that proper vitamin D supplementation may improve the ability of the cells of the islets of Langerhans to synthesize many proteins de novo and to convert proinsulin to insulin. Apart from regulating bone metabolism and also calcium and phosphate homeostasis, 1,25(OH)2D3 exerts antiproliferative and pro-differentiating effects on a wide variety of cell types. It also induces apoptosis of cancer cells and slows their proliferation. In a number of major studies the relationship between low vitamin D levels and increased risk of various cancers was observed. It concerns colorectal, lung, prostate, breast and ovarian cancer. It was observed that in patients with low serum vitamin D concentrations such disorders as ischemic heart disease, heart attack, stroke, cardiac arrhythmia, and hypertension were more frequent and mortality was significantly higher. These results led the researchers to consider vitamin D deficiency as a potential risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. The possible mechanism in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases that may be related to low levels of vitamin D, is its adverse effect on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Calcitriol is also an important determinant of muscle cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as inhibition of apoptosis. Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin. However, there are only a few food products that are rich in vitamin D3, e.g.: fish oils, fish and fortified-products, such as dairy products and margarines.

The objective of this review was to gain an appreciation of the recent causative evidence linking vitamin D and endothelial function. The PubMed database was searched from 2009 to date. Key words used were vitamin D, supplementation, systemic inflammation, endothelium, endothelial dysfunction and humans. Selected articles were restricted to the English language and to randomized control trials (RCTs) of vitamin D supplementation with direct measures of endothelial function. Final inclusion was based on a quality rating ≥ 3, based on the Jadad score. Ten RCTs met these criteria and were summarized for their outcomes. Only two studies showed an improvement in flow mediated dilatation with vitamin D. Three other studies reported decreases in C-reactive protein, platelet activation inhibitor-1, tissue plasminogen activator or B type natriuretic peptide. Recent evidence from good quality RCTs did not support a beneficial effect of vitamin D on vascular reactivity.

Preconception underweight or overweight, short stature and micronutrient deficiencies all contribute to excess maternal and fetal complications during pregnancy. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence was conducted to ascertain the possible impact of preconception care for adolescents, women and couples of reproductive age on maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH) outcomes. A comprehensive strategy was used to search electronic reference libraries, and both observational and clinical controlled trials were included. Cross-referencing and a separate search strategy for each preconception risk and intervention ensured wider study capture. Maternal pre-pregnancy weight is a significant factor in the preconception period with underweight contributing to a 32% higher risk of preterm birth, and obesity more than doubling the risk for preeclampsia, gestational diabetes. Overweight women are more likely to undergo a Cesarean delivery, and their newborns have higher chances of being born with a neural tube or congenital heart defect. Among nutrition-specific interventions, preconception folic acid supplementation has the strongest evidence of effect, preventing 69% of recurrent neural tube defects. Multiple micronutrient supplementation shows promise to reduce the rates of congenital anomalies and risk of preeclampsia. Although over 40% of women worldwide are anemic in the preconception period, only one study has shown a risk for low birth weight. All women, but especially those who become pregnant in adolescence or have closely-spaced pregnancies (inter-pregnancy interval less than six months), require nutritional assessment and appropriate intervention in the preconception period with an emphasis on optimizing maternal body mass index and micronutrient reserves. Increasing coverage of nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive strategies (such as food fortification; integration of nutrition initiatives with other maternal and child health interventions; and community based platforms) is necessary among adolescent girls and women of reproductive age. The effectiveness of interventions will need to be simultaneously monitored, and form the basis for the development of improved delivery strategies and new nutritional interventions.",Dean SV; Lassi ZS; Imam AM; Bhutta ZA,Reproductive health,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25415364/,0,1,0,1,0,0
25412840,"Effect of the natural sweetener, steviol glycoside, on cardiovascular risk factors: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials.","Many different dietary supplements are currently marketed for the management of hypertension and diabetes, but the evidence for effectiveness is mixed. The objective of this systematic review was to critically appraise and evaluate the evidence for effectiveness of steviol glycosides (stevioside and rebaudioside A) on cardiovascular risk factors, using data from randomised clinical trials (RCTs). Electronic searches were conducted in Medline, Embase, Amed, Cinahl and The Cochrane Library. We also searched Google Scholar, and hand searched the bibliography of retrieved full texts. The reporting quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane criteria. Two reviewers independently determined the eligibility, assessed the reporting quality, and extracted the data. Nine studies with a total of 756 participants were included. There was a variation in the reporting quality of included studies. Meta-analysis revealed a non-significant difference in systolic blood pressure between steviol glycoside and placebo, mean difference (MD): -2.98 mm Hg (-6.23 to 0.27). Significant reductions in diastolic blood pressure and fasting blood glucose were observed. There was no significant effect on blood lipid profile. Heterogeneity was significant. Adverse events included abdominal fullness, epigastric pain, and dizziness. The evidence from published RCTs suggests that stevioside may generate reductions in blood pressure and fasting blood glucose. The sizes of the effects are small, and the substantial heterogeneity limits the robustness of any conclusions. Rebaudioside A does not appear to have any significant effects on blood pressure or cardiovascular risk factors. Available clinical trials vary in design and reporting quality, and some are characterised by inadequate sample sizes. In addition, the participants in most of the trials have high cardiovascular risk. Further clinical trials and regulatory assessments are warranted.",Onakpoya IJ; Heneghan CJ,European journal of preventive cardiology,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25412840/,0,1,0,1,0,0
25409159,"Dietary interventions, lifestyle changes, and dietary supplements in preventing gestational diabetes mellitus: a literature review.","Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with increased rates of fetal morbidity and mortality, both during the pregnancy and in the postnatal life. Current treatment of GDM includes diet with or without medications, but this management is expensive and poorly cost-effective for the health care systems. Strategies to prevent such condition would be preferable with respect to its treatment. The aim of this literature review was to evaluate studies reporting the efficacy of the most used approaches to prevent GDM as well as evidences of efficacy and safety of dietary supplementations. Systematic literature searches were performed in electronic databases, covering the period January 1983 to April 2014. Randomized controlled clinical trials were included. Quality of the articles was evaluated with the Jadad scale. We did not evaluate those articles that were already entered in the most recent systematic reviews, and we completed the research with the trials published thereafter. Of 55 articles identified, 15 randomized controlled trials were eligible. Quality and heterogeneity of the studies cannot allow firm conclusions. Anyway, trials in which only intake or expenditure has been targeted mostly reported negative results. On the contrary, combined lifestyle programs including diet control (orienting food intake, restricting energy intake) associated with moderate but continuous physical activity exhibit better efficacy in reducing GDM prevalence. The results from dietary supplements with myoinositol or probiotics are promising. The actual evidences provide enough arguments for implementing large-scale, high-quality randomized controlled trials looking at the possible benefits of these new approaches for preventing GDM.",Facchinetti F; Dante G; Petrella E; Neri I,Obstetrical & gynecological survey,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25409159/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The gut microbiome has been identified as a key factor for maintaining health outside of pregnancy and could contribute to pregnancy complications. In addition, the vaginal and the recently revealed placental microbiome are altered in pregnancy and may play a role in pregnancy complications. Probiotic supplementation could help to regulate the unbalanced microflora composition observed in obesity and diabetes. Here, the impact of probiotic supplementation during pregnancy and infancy is reviewed. There are indications for a protective role in preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, vaginal infections, maternal and infant weight gain and allergic diseases.

25388747,Vitamins and type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"The present review evaluates the relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus and individual or combined vitamins. Antioxidant vitamins A, C and E are found decreased in diabetic subjects, possibly due to an increased need to control the excessive oxidative stress produced by abnormalities in glucose metabolism. On the other hand, retinol binding protein exerts a modulating effect, as it has adipokine functions. With respect to the B group vitamins, thiamin, pyridoxine and biotin have been found decreased but the mechanisms are not clear, however supplementation has shown some improvement of the metabolic control in diabetic patients. The absorption of folic acid and vitamin B12 is importantly decreased by the prolongued use of metformin, which is the first choice drug in uncomplicated diabetes, thus these two nutrients have been found deficient in the disease and most probably need to be supplemented regularly. On the other hand, vitamin D is considered a risk factor for the development of diabetes as well as its complications, particularly cardiovascular ones. Although some studies have found an association of vitamin K intake with glucose metabolism further research is needed. Studies on the use of multivitamin supplements have shown unconclusive results. After reviewing the evidence, no real recommendation on the use of vitamin supplements in type 2 diabetes mellitus can be issued, however patients using metformin during prolongued periods may need folic acid and vitamin B12.",Valdés-Ramos R; Guadarrama-López AL; Martínez-Carrillo BE; Benítez-Arciniega AD,"Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25388747/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25371590,Dietary supplements in the management of hypertension and diabetes - a review.,"The use of alternative therapies like herbs and dietary supplements is very common among hypertensive and diabetic patients all over the globe. Hypertension is a silent disease that causes increase in cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, renal morbidity and mortality whereas diabetic complications cause heart attack, stroke, blindness and kidney disease. These are serious and chronic metabolic disorders that have a significant impact on the health, quality of life, and life expectancy of patients, as well as on the health care systems. Orthodox drugs used for the treatment of hypertension and diabetes produce side effects such as headache, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, constipation, diarrhea, weakness, fatigue and erectile dysfunction. The need for considering alternate therapies in the form of dietary supplements known to promote good health, having little or no side effects therefore arises. This review was carried out using comprehensive and systematic literature reports on the concurrent use of dietary supplements in the management of diabetes and hypertension. Empirical searches were conducted using Google scholar (http://scholar.google.com), and Science Direct (http://www.sciencedirect.com). In addition to these databases, the University database was also used. Searches were also undertaken using keyword combinations such as dietary supplements and the names of the diseases in question. This review chronicled the therapeutic values of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, fruits, vegetables, herbs and other botanicals used as dietary supplements. Results show that these supplements provided better and safe substitutes to toxic and expensive conventional drugs. Generally dietary supplements are free from major side effects, readily available and affordable. It is envisaged that the use of dietary supplement will promote good health and improve the status of hypertensive and diabetic patients. Medical doctors are therefore encouraged to incorporate dietary supplements into the regimen employed for hypertension and diabetes management.",Afolayan AJ; Wintola OA,"African journal of traditional, complementary, and alternative medicines : AJTCAM",2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25371590/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25371519,Essentiality and toxicity of vanadium supplements in health and pathology.,"The biological properties of vanadium complexes have become an object of interest due to their therapeutic potential in several diseases. However, the mechanisms of action of vanadium salts are still poorly understood. Vanadium complexes are cofactors for several enzymes and also exhibit insulin-mimetic properties. Thus, they are involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism, including in patients with diabetes. In addition, vanadium salts may also normalize blood pressure and play a key role in the metabolism of the thyroid and of iron as well as in the regulation of total cholesterol, cholesterol HDL and triglyceride (TG) levels in blood. Moreover, in cases of hypoxia, vanadium compounds may improve cardiomyocytes function. They may also exhibit both carcinogenic and anti-cancer properties. These include dose- and exposure-time-dependent induction and inhibition of the proliferation and survival of cancer cells. On the other hand, the balance between vanadium's therapeutic properties and its side effects has not yet been determined. Therefore, any studies on the potential use of vanadium compounds as supplements to support the treatment of a number of diseases must be strictly monitored for adverse effects.",Gruzewska K; Michno A; Pawelczyk T; Bielarczyk H,Journal of physiology and pharmacology : an official journal of the Polish Physiological Society,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25371519/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25366895,Protective and therapeutic effectiveness of taurine in diabetes mellitus: a rationale for antioxidant supplementation.,"Taurine, 2-amino ethanesulfonic acid, is a conditionally essential β amino acid which is not utilized in protein synthesis. Taurine is one of the most abundant free amino acids in mammals tissues and is one of the three well-known sulfur-containing amino acids; the others are methionine and cysteine which are considered as the precursors for taurine synthesis. Different scientific studies emphasize on the cytoprotective properties of taurine which included antioxidation, antiapoptosis, membrane stabilization, osmoregulation, and neurotransmission. Protective and therapeutic ameliorations of oxidative stress-induced pathologies were also attributed to taurine both in experimental and human models. Data demonstrating the beneficial effectiveness of taurine against type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus and their complications are growing and providing a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. Although the clinical studies are limited compared to the experimental ones, the present updated systematic review of the literature is set up to provide experimental and clinical evidences regarding the effectiveness of taurine in the context of diabetes mellitus and its complications. Gathering these scientific effects of taurine on diabetes mellitus could provide the physicians and specially the endocrinologists with a comprehensive overview on possible trends in the prevention and management of the disease and its complications through antioxidant supplementation.",Sirdah MM,Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25366895/,0,1,0,0,0,0
25364882,Dietary Sulforaphane in Cancer Chemoprevention: The Role of Epigenetic Regulation and HDAC Inhibition.,"Sulforaphane, produced by the hydrolytic conversion of glucoraphanin after ingestion of cruciferous vegetables, particularly broccoli and broccoli sprouts, has been extensively studied due to its apparent health-promoting properties in disease and limited toxicity in normal tissue. Recent Studies: Recent identification of a sub-population of tumor cells with stem cell-like self-renewal capacity that may be responsible for relapse, metastasis, and resistance, as a potential target of the dietary compound, may be an important aspect of sulforaphane chemoprevention. Evidence also suggests that sulforaphane may target the epigenetic alterations observed in specific cancers, reversing aberrant changes in gene transcription through mechanisms of histone deacetylase inhibition, global demethylation, and microRNA modulation. In this review, we discuss the biochemical and biological properties of sulforaphane with a particular emphasis on the anticancer properties of the dietary compound. Sulforaphane possesses the capacity to intervene in multistage carcinogenesis through the modulation and/or regulation of important cellular mechanisms. The inhibition of phase I enzymes that are responsible for the activation of pro-carcinogens, and the induction of phase II enzymes that are critical in mutagen elimination are well-characterized chemopreventive properties. Furthermore, sulforaphane mediates a number of anticancer pathways, including the activation of apoptosis, induction of cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of NFκB. Further characterization of the chemopreventive properties of sulforaphane and its capacity to be selectively toxic to malignant cells are warranted to potentially establish the clinical utility of the dietary compound as an anti-cancer compound alone, and in combination with clinically relevant therapeutic and management strategies.",Tortorella SM; Royce SG; Licciardi PV; Karagiannis TC,Antioxidants & redox signaling,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25364882/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25359323,Vitamin D and obesity: current perspectives and future directions.,"In recent years, new functional roles of vitamin D beyond its traditional role in calcium homoeostasis and bone metabolism have emerged linking the fat-soluble vitamin to various non-communicable diseases. Vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) < 25-30 nmol/l) and sub-optimal status (25(OH)D < 50-100 nmol/l) are increasingly associated with unfavourable metabolic phenotypes, including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and CVD; conditions also commonly linked with overweight and obesity. Early studies reported poor vitamin D status in the morbidly obese. More recently, it has been observed that a graded relationship between vitamin D status and BMI, or specifically adiposity, exists in the general population. A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the potential mechanisms whereby alterations in the vitamin D endocrine system occur in the obese state. Plausible explanations include sequestration in adipose tissue, volumetric dilution or negative feedback mechanisms from increased circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Others hypothesise that heavier individuals may partake in less outdoor activity, may also cover-up and wear more clothing than leaner individuals, thus decreasing sun exposure and limiting endogenous production of cholecalciferol in the skin. Moreover, in some but not all studies, BMI and adiposity have been negatively associated with the change in vitamin D status following vitamin D supplementation. It therefore remains unclear if body size and/or adiposity should be taken into account when determining the dietary requirements for vitamin D. This review will evaluate the current evidence linking vitamin D status and supplementation to overweight and obesity, and discuss the implications for setting dietary requirements.",Pourshahidi LK,The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25359323/,1,0,0,0,0,0

25338271,The use of dietary supplements to alleviate androgen deprivation therapy side effects during prostate cancer treatment.,"Prostate cancer (PCa), the most commonly diagnosed cancer and second leading cause of male cancer death in Western societies, is typically androgen-dependent, a characteristic that underlies the rationale of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Approximately 90% of patients initially respond to ADT strategies, however many experience side effects including hot flashes, cardiotoxicity, metabolic and musculoskeletal alterations. This review summarizes pre-clinical and clinical studies investigating the ability of dietary supplements to alleviate adverse effects arising from ADT. In particular, we focus on herbal compounds, phytoestrogens, selenium (Se), fatty acids (FA), calcium, and Vitamins D and E. Indeed, there is some evidence that calcium and Vitamin D can prevent the development of osteoporosis during ADT. On the other hand, caution should be taken with the antioxidants Se and Vitamin E until the basis underlying their respective association with type 2 diabetes mellitus and PCa tumor development has been clarified. However, many other promising supplements have not yet been subjected large-scale clinical trials making it difficult to assess their efficacy. Given the demographic trend of increased PCa diagnoses and dependence on ADT as a major therapeutic strategy, further studies are required to objectively evaluate these supplements as adjuvant for PCa patients receiving ADT.",Dueregger A; Heidegger I; Ofer P; Perktold B; Ramoner R; Klocker H; Eder IE,Nutrients,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25338271/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25312616,Polyphenols in disease: from diet to supplements.,"Polyphenols are a structural class of natural and synthetic, organic chemicals characterized mainly by the presence of phenol structural units. Numerous epidemiological and experimental studies have strongly suggested their beneficial effects for human health. This view is supported by their biological activities, which are associated with chemical and biochemical properties, including the ability to act as antioxidants, their antineoplastic effect and the regulation of gene expression in chronic degenerative diseases. These mechanisms of action could account for their preventive and therapeutic uses in human subjects. Moreover, in some therapeutic uses, such as antineoplastic effect, a prooxidant therapeutic action has been suggested. In the diet, numerous compounds could participate in the beneficial properties, and this likely could result in synergistic effects because the whole effect is better than the separately action of each compound. However, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of these bioactive micronutrients are yet to be further characterized. More research is required to fully establish the therapeutic use of polyphenols against human disease. Based on biological and pharmacological properties of polyphenols both as diet components and supplements, the objective of this work is to show an updated version about the role that polyphenols could play in several chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.",Rodrigo R; Libuy M; Feliu F; Hasson D,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25312616/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Low levels of vitamin D status, as measured by 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], are common in pregnant women. Meta-analysis of observational studies has demonstrated positive associations between vitamin D status and adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, preterm birth and small-for-gestational age. There was heterogeneity among studies in terms of design, population, geographic location, definitions of exposure and outcome, gestational age at sampling, confounding factors and approach to analyses. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicate that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy optimizes maternal and neonatal vitamin D status. Recent evidence supports that low maternal vitamin D status is associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Interventional studies demonstrate that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy optimizes maternal and neonatal vitamin D status. Large, well designed, multicentre RCTs are required to determine whether vitamin D supplementation in pregnant women with low vitamin D status reduces the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.",Wei SQ,Current opinion in obstetrics & gynecology,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25310531/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25307311,Long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in pediatric metabolic syndrome.,"Concomitantly with the increasing prevalence of childhood obesity, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) is rising among children and adolescents, leading to fears for future epidemics of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease in the young. MetS includes central obesity, hypertension, low HDL cholesterol, high triglycerides, and elevated concentrations of fasting blood glucose. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is the most common cause of chronic liver disease both in adults and children, is currently considered as the hepatic component of MetS. Growing evidence suggests that n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) may have a beneficial role on many factors associated with MetS, including circulating lipids and low-grade chronic inflammation. Recently, there has also been growing interest in n-3 LC-PUFAs supplementation as potential treatment for NAFLD, which is pathogenically linked to insulin resistance and involves inflammation in its advanced stages. Problems of adherence to lifestyle interventions, especially in children, and side effects with pharmacological agents make the dietary fish oil supplementation a simple and practical alternative therapy. Fish oil provides a convenient source of essential n-3 LCPUFA with few side effects, and may directly decrease circulating lipids, hepatic lipogenesis and steatosis, and chronic inflammation. In this review, we examine observational and interventional studies assessing in children and adolescents the potential impact of dietary n-3 PUFA supplementation on MetS components including NAFLD, and discuss the mechanisms underlying the actions of n-3 LC- PUFA on multiple risk factors associated with MetS.",Pacifico L; Giansanti S; Gallozzi A; Chiesa C,Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25307311/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25255832,"Iron, oxidative stress and gestational diabetes.","Both iron deficiency and hyperglycemia are highly prevalent globally for pregnant women. Iron supplementation is recommended during pregnancy to control iron deficiency. The purposes of the review are to assess the oxidative effects of iron supplementation and the potential relationship between iron nutrition and gestational diabetes. High doses of iron (~relative to 60 mg or more daily for adult humans) can induce lipid peroxidation in vitro and in animal studies. Pharmaceutical doses of iron supplements (e.g., 10× RDA or more for oral supplements or direct iron supplementation via injection or addition to the cell culture medium) for a short or long duration will induce DNA damage. Higher heme-iron intake or iron status measured by various biomarkers, especially serum ferritin, might contribute to greater risk of gestational diabetes, which may be mediated by iron oxidative stress though lipid oxidation and/or DNA damage. However, information is lacking about the effect of low dose iron supplementation (≤ 60 mg daily) on lipid peroxidation, DNA damage and gestational diabetes. Randomized trials of low-dose iron supplementation (≤ 60 mg daily) for pregnant women are warranted to test the relationship between iron oxidative stress and insulin resistance/gestational diabetes, especially for iron-replete women.",Zhuang T; Han H; Yang Z,Nutrients,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25255832/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Zinc in human plays an important role in cell mediated immunity and is also an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. Zinc supplementation studies in the elderly have shown decreased incidence of infections, decreased oxidative stress, and decreased generation of inflammatory cytokines. Decreased incidences of blindness in patients with AMD and increased atheroprotective effect have been observed in the zinc supplemented elderly.

25194613,Spice plant Allium cepa: dietary supplement for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and its prevalence is increasing worldwide. Although conventional antidiabetic agents are known to ameliorate the symptoms of diabetes, they also may cause adverse effects. The purpose of this review was to organize and discuss various studies that have been previously conducted indicating the efficacy of Allium cepa in DM. A comprehensive English literature search was conducted using various electronic search databases. Different search terms were used and an advanced search was conducted by combining all the search fields in abstracts, keywords, and titles. Allium cepa, a spice plant, is commonly known as onion and belongs to the family liliaceae. Since ancient times, it has been used traditionally for the treatment of different diseases. Among various activities of Allium cepa, regulation of hypoglycemic activity is considered one of its important effects in DM. Sulfur compounds including S-methylcysteine and flavonoids such as quercetin are mainly responsible for the hypoglycemic activity of Allium cepa. S-methylcysteine and flavonoids help to decrease the levels of blood glucose, serum lipids, oxidative stress, and lipid peroxidation, as well as increasing antioxidant enzyme activity and insulin secretion. Extracts of onion also have been shown to have hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects by normalizing the activities of liver hexokinase, glucose 6-phosphatase and HMG coenzyme-A reductase. In preliminarily clinical trials, patients with diabetes safely consumed slices of Allium cepa, exhibiting sufficient hypoglycemic activity. In the future, further studies must be conducted to investigate and confirm the hypoglycemic activities of Allium cepa and its constituents and/or their synthetic analogs. This review will not only elucidate the nutritious facts of Allium cepa but may also help in understanding the molecular basis of its effects in DM. This review will explore in particular the medicinal characteristics of Allium cepa supporting that the consumption of dietary onion could lower blood glucose levels, thus contributing to the reduction of risk factors associated with DM.",Akash MS; Rehman K; Chen S,"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25194613/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Intervention studies that increase dairy intake often involve lifestyle changes, including weight loss, which alone will improve insulin sensitivity. The aim of this review was to examine weight stable intervention studies that assess the effect of an increased intake of dairy products or dairy derived supplements on glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. An electronic search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database and Web of Science for randomised controlled trials altering only dairy intake in humans with no other lifestyle or dietary change, particularly no weight change, and with measurement of glucose or insulin. Healthy participants and those with features of the metabolic syndrome were included. Chronic whey protein supplementation was also included. Ten studies were included in this systematic review. In adults, four of the dairy interventions showed a positive effect on insulin sensitivity as assessed by Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA); one was negative and five had no effect.

We conducted a systematic review, which included searches in nine scholarly databases and six clinical trial registries, and identified randomized controlled clinical trials whereby resveratrol was used as an adjunct to pharmaceutical interventions in T2DM. Meta-analysis on clinical parameters was performed for available data. Of 764 articles originally identified, data from six unique datasets, examining a total of 196 T2DM patients (104 resveratrol, 92 control/placebo) ultimately met inclusion criteria. Statistically significant (p < 0.05) positive effects, indicating that resveratrol supplementation was more effective than placebo/control, were identified for systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, and creatinine, but not for fasting glucose, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, diastolic blood pressure, insulin, triglycerides, LDL, or HDL cholesterol. No major adverse events were reported and side effects of resveratrol were not different than placebo/control. Though limitations in sample size and treatment duration preclude definitive changes in clinical practice, significant improvements in multiple cardiometabolic biomarkers and an excellent safety profile support resveratrol as a leading candidate as an adjunct to pharmacological management of T2DM.",Hausenblas HA; Schoulda JA; Smoliga JM,Molecular nutrition & food research,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25138371/,0,1,0,1,0,0

The herbal and dietary supplement market has grown exponentially over the past decade as Americans increasingly use such agents for generalized health and the prevention and treatment of chronic disease states.1 Pharmacist advice is often requested on the use of these agents for the management of T2DM; however, this is an area that has insufficient evidence to support confident recommendations. Many published studies involving herbal agents and dietary supplements are small and poorly designed, with heterogeneous results. Pharmacists should be aware of the safety and efficacy data available for these agents, recognize potential drug interactions, and identify acceptable manufactured products. The strongest scientific evidence for blood glucose lowering effect is associated with alpha-lipoic acid and fenugreek. There is also good evidence supporting the use of ivy gourd, gymnema, and vitamin E for management of hyperglycemia; however, caution should be used when recommending vitamin E. Pharmacists should advise consumers to disclose use of any of these products to all of their health care providers.",Smith JD; Clinard VB,Journal of the American Pharmacists Association : JAPhA,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25107389/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Moreover, LA conjugates with other pharmacophores represent a promising approach toward the development of multifunctional drugs. The reviewed patent applications from January 2011 to April 2014 include combinations of LA with other bioactive compounds as well as LA conjugates for the treatment of a wide range of clinical conditions. Additionally, some patents disclose methods to overcome the stability problems of LA. LA is currently in clinical use for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy, while small clinical trials using combinations of LA with known bioactive agents have been undertaken. The use of the LA is hampered by its instability and its rapid metabolism. Thus, formulations containing LA, in a form ensuring its stability and improving its bioavailability, can have important applications as medicines, nutritional supplements or cosmeceuticals. LA hybrids with other pharmacophores endowed with various activities, possess an enormous potential to promote human health and have been the subject of numerous publications and patent applications.

27132311,Vitamin D: Recent Recommendations and Discoveries.,"The evidence continues to mount for the important role of vitamin D as a hormone that provides protective benefits to the immune system. Guidelines have been developed recommending routine vitamin D supplementation in order to optimize bone health, including aiming for a goal 25(OH)D concentration greater than 30 ng/mL among select patient groups who are at risk for skeletal deficits or vitamin D deficiency itself. Whether this level is the optimal one that confers the extraskeletal benefits of vitamin D remains unknown. Whether healthy children and adolescents may benefit from maintenance of 25(OH)D levels at higher thresholds also is unknown and under study. Adolescence is a critical time for the accrual of peak bone mass, and optimizing vitamin D during this important developmental period and throughout the life cycle may be beneficial for and beyond the skeleton. Although routine screening of 25(OH)D levels is not currently recommended, those individuals at higher risk for insufficiency/deficiency should be screened and appropriately supplemented.",Simoneau T; Gordon CM,Adolescent medicine: state of the art reviews,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27132311/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25076495,Effect of tree nuts on glycemic control in diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled dietary trials.,"Tree nut consumption has been associated with reduced diabetes risk, however, results from randomized trials on glycemic control have been inconsistent. To provide better evidence for diabetes guidelines development, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to assess the effects of tree nuts on markers of glycemic control in individuals with diabetes. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases through 6 April 2014. Randomized controlled trials ≥3 weeks conducted in individuals with diabetes that compare the effect of diets emphasizing tree nuts to isocaloric diets without tree nuts on HbA1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and HOMA-IR. Two independent reviewer's extracted relevant data and assessed study quality and risk of bias. Data were pooled by the generic inverse variance method and expressed as mean differences (MD) with 95% CI's. Heterogeneity was assessed (Cochran Q-statistic) and quantified (I2). Twelve trials (n = 450) were included. Diets emphasizing tree nuts at a median dose of 56 g/d significantly lowered HbA1c (MD = -0.07% [95% CI:-0.10, -0.03%]; P = 0.0003) and fasting glucose (MD = -0.15 mmol/L [95% CI: -0.27, -0.02 mmol/L]; P = 0.03) compared with control diets. No significant treatment effects were observed for fasting insulin and HOMA-IR, however the direction of effect favoured tree nuts. Majority of trials were of short duration and poor quality. Pooled analyses show that tree nuts improve glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes, supporting their inclusion in a healthy diet. Owing to the uncertainties in our analyses there is a need for longer, higher quality trials with a focus on using nuts to displace high-glycemic index carbohydrates.

25066830,Shining the light on Sunshine: a systematic review of the influence of sun exposure on type 2 diabetes mellitus-related outcomes.,"Prospective observational studies uniformly link vitamin D deficiency with the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), yet trials supplementing participants at risk of T2DM with vitamin D to reduce progression to T2DM have yielded inconsistent results. Inconsistencies between supplementation trials may be due to insufficient dosing or small sample sizes. Observational studies may also have reported spurious associations due to uncontrolled confounding by lifestyle or genetic factors. Alternatively, observational and intervention studies may not be entirely comparable. Observational studies show an association between higher vitamin D status, which is predominantly derived from sun exposure, and decreased incidence of T2DM. Trials intervene with vitamin D supplementation, and therefore may be missing alternate causes of the effect of sun exposure, as seen in observational studies. We propose that sun exposure may be the driving force behind the associations seen in observational studies; sun exposure may have additional benefits beyond increasing serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels. We performed an electronic literature search to identify articles that examined associations between sun exposure and T2DM and/or glucose metabolism. A best evidence synthesis was then conducted using outcomes from analyses deemed to have high methodological quality. Ten eligible full-text articles were identified, yielding 19 T2DM-related outcomes. The best evidence analysis considered 11 outcomes which were grouped into six outcome types: T2DM, fasting glucose, glucose tolerance, fasting insulin, insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. There was moderate evidence to support a role of recreational sun exposure in reducing odds of T2DM incidence. High-level evidence was lacking; evidence presented for other outcomes was of low or insufficient level. This review highlights significant gaps in research pertaining to sun exposure and T2DM-related outcomes. Further research is encouraged as we aim to identify novel preventative strategies for T2DM.",Shore-Lorenti C; Brennan SL; Sanders KM; Neale RE; Lucas RM; Ebeling PR,Clinical endocrinology,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25066830/,0,1,0,0,0,0
25063312,[Breastfeeding: health benefits for child and mother].,"The prevalence of breastfeeding in France is one of the lowest in Europe: 65% of infants born in France in 2010 were breastfed when leaving the maternity ward. Exclusive breastfeeding allows normal growth until at least 6 months of age, and can be prolonged until the age of 2 years or more, provided that complementary feeding is started after 6 months. Breast milk contains hormones, growth factors, cytokines, immunocompetent cells, etc., and has many biological properties. The composition of breast milk is influenced by gestational and postnatal age, as well as by the moment of the feed. Breastfeeding is associated with slightly enhanced performance on tests of cognitive development. Exclusive breastfeeding for at least 3 months is associated with a lower incidence and severity of diarrhoea, otitis media and respiratory infection. Exclusive breastfeeding for at least 4 months is associated with a lower incidence of allergic disease (asthma, atopic dermatitis) during the first 2 to 3 years of life in at-risk infants (infants with at least one first-degree relative presenting with allergy). Breastfeeding is also associated with a lower incidence of obesity during childhood and adolescence, as well as with a lower blood pressure and cholesterolemia in adulthood. However, no beneficial effect of breastfeeding on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has been shown. Maternal infection with hepatitis B and C virus is not a contraindication to breastfeeding, as opposed to HIV infection and galactosemia. A supplementation with vitamin D and K is necessary in the breastfed infant. Very few medications contraindicate breastfeeding. Premature babies can be breastfed and/or receive mother's milk and/or bank milk, provided they receive energy, protein and mineral supplements. Return to prepregnancy weight is earlier in breastfeeding mothers during the 6 months following delivery. Breastfeeding is also associated with a decreased risk of breast and ovarian cancer in the premenopausal period, and of osteoporosis in the postmenopausal period.",Turck D; Vidailhet M; Bocquet A; Bresson JL; Briend A; Chouraqui JP; Darmaun D; Dupont C; Frelut ML; Girardet JP; Goulet O; Hankard R; Rieu D; Simeoni U,Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25063312/,0,0,0,0,0,0
25062463,Clinical review: Effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on improving glucose homeostasis and preventing diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Observational studies report consistent associations between low vitamin D concentration and increased glycemia and risk of type 2 diabetes, but results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are mixed. The objective of the study was to systematically review RCTs that report on the effects of vitamin D supplementation on glucose homeostasis or diabetes prevention. Sources of data for the study were MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Health Technology Assessment, and Science Citation Index from inception to June 2013. Study selection was trials that compared vitamin D3 supplementation with placebo or a non-vitamin D supplement in adults with normal glucose tolerance, prediabetes, or type 2 diabetes. Two reviewers collected data and assessed trial quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Random-effects models were used to estimate mean differences (MDs) and odds ratios. The main outcomes of interest were homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function, hemoglobin A1c levels, fasting blood glucose, incident diabetes, and adverse events. Thirty-five trials (43 407 patients) with variable risk of bias were included. Vitamin D had no significant effects on insulin resistance [homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance: MD -0.04; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.30 to 0.22, I-squared statistic (I(2)) = 45%], insulin secretion (homeostasis model of β-cell function: MD 1.64; 95% CI -25.94 to 29.22, I(2) = 40%), or hemoglobin A1c (MD -0.05%; 95% CI -0.12 to 0.03, I(2) = 55%) compared with controls. Four RCTs reported on the progression to new diabetes and found no effect of vitamin D (odds ratio 1.02; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.10, I(2) = 0%). Adverse events were rare, and there was no evidence of publication bias. Evidence from available trials shows no effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on glucose homeostasis or diabetes prevention. Definitive conclusions may be limited in the context of the moderate degree of heterogeneity, variable risk of bias, and short-term follow-up duration of the available evidence to date.",Seida JC; Mitri J; Colmers IN; Majumdar SR; Davidson MB; Edwards AL; Hanley DA; Pittas AG; Tjosvold L; Johnson JA,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25062463/,0,1,0,1,0,1
25042841,The effects of calcium supplementation on verified coronary heart disease hospitalization and death in postmenopausal women: a collaborative meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Calcium supplementation, particularly with vitamin D, has been an approved public health intervention to reduce fracture risk. Enthusiasm for this intervention has been mitigated by meta-analyses suggesting that calcium supplementation with or without vitamin D increases myocardial infarction (MI) risk; however, concern has been raised over the design of these meta-analyses. We, therefore, undertook a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials with placebo or no-treatment control groups to determine if these supplements increase all-cause mortality and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk including MI, angina pectoris and acute coronary syndrome, and chronic CHD verified by clinical review, hospital record, or death certificate in elderly women. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases were searched from January 1, 1966, to May 24, 2013, for potentially eligible studies, reference lists were checked, and trial investigators were contacted where additional unpublished data were required. The search yielded 661 potentially eligible reports of which 18 met the inclusion criteria and contributed information on 63,563 participants with 3390 CHD events and 4157 deaths. Two authors extracted the data independently with trial data combined using random-effects meta-analysis to calculate the relative risk (RR). Five trials contributed CHD events with pooled relative RR of 1.02 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96-1.09; p = 0.51). Seventeen trials contributed all-cause mortality data with pooled RR of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.91-1.02; p = 0.18). Heterogeneity among the trials was low for both primary outcomes (I(2)  = 0%). For secondary outcomes, the RR for MI was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.92-1.26; p = 0.32), angina pectoris and acute coronary syndrome 1.09 (95% CI, 0.95-1.24; p = 0.22) and chronic CHD 0.92 (95% CI, 0.73-1.15; p = 0.46).

One such mechanism concerns the role of diet in modulating the activity and function of microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules that are involved in posttranscriptional gene silencing and have been shown to control gene expression in diverse biological processes including development, differentiation, cell proliferation, metabolism, and inflammation as well as in human diseases. Recent evidence described in this review highlights how dietary factors may influence cancer, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease through modulation of miRNA expression. Additionally, circulating miRNAs are emerging as putative biomarkers of disease, susceptibility, and perhaps dietary exposure.

25025896,Vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy: a systematic review.,"It is unclear whether or not the current evidence base allows definite conclusions to be made regarding the optimal maternal circulating concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] during pregnancy, and how this might best be achieved. To answer the following questions: (1) What are the clinical criteria for vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women? (2) What adverse maternal and neonatal health outcomes are associated with low maternal circulating 25(OH)D? (3) Does maternal supplementation with vitamin D in pregnancy lead to an improvement in these outcomes (including assessment of compliance and effectiveness)? (4) What is the optimal type (D2 or D3), dose, regimen and route for vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy? (5) Is supplementation with vitamin D in pregnancy likely to be cost-effective? We performed a systematic review and where possible combined study results using meta-analysis to estimate the combined effect size. Major electronic databases [including Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) database] were searched from inception up to June 2012 covering both published and grey literature. Bibliographies of selected papers were hand-searched for additional references. Relevant authors were contacted for any unpublished findings and additional data if necessary. Abstracts were reviewed by two reviewers. pregnant women or pregnant women and their offspring. either assessment of vitamin D status [dietary intake, sunlight exposure, circulating 25(OH)D concentration] or supplementation of participants with vitamin D or food containing vitamin D (e.g. oily fish). offspring - birthweight, birth length, head circumference, bone mass, anthropometry and body composition, risk of asthma and atopy, small for gestational dates, preterm birth, type 1 diabetes mellitus, low birthweight, serum calcium concentration, blood pressure and rickets; mother - pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, risk of caesarean section and bacterial vaginosis. Seventy-six studies were included. There was considerable heterogeneity between the studies and for most outcomes there was conflicting evidence. The evidence base was insufficient to reliably answer question 1 in relation to biochemical or disease outcomes. For questions 2 and 3, modest positive relationships were identified between maternal 25(OH)D and (1) offspring birthweight in meta-analysis of three observational studies using log-transformed 25(OH)D concentrations after adjustment for potential confounding factors [pooled regression coefficient 5.63 g/10% change maternal 25(OH)D, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11 to 10.16 g], but not in those four studies using natural units, or across intervention studies; (2) offspring cord blood or postnatal calcium concentrations in a meta-analysis of six intervention studies (all found to be at high risk of bias; mean difference 0.05 mmol/l, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.05 mmol/l); and (3) offspring bone mass in observational studies judged to be of good quality, but which did not permit meta-analysis. The evidence base was insufficient to reliably answer questions 4 and 5. Study methodology varied widely in terms of study design, population used, vitamin D status assessment, exposure measured and outcome definition. The evidence base is currently insufficient to support definite clinical recommendations regarding vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy. Although there is modest evidence to support a relationship between maternal 25(OH)D status and offspring birthweight, bone mass and serum calcium concentrations, these findings were limited by their observational nature (birthweight, bone mass) or risk of bias and low quality (calcium concentrations).

25005188,Dietary polyphenols and type 2 diabetes: current insights and future perspectives.,"Significant evidence suggests that polyphenol-rich diets have the ability to protect against diabetes. Since several previous reviews focused on the nutrition and health effects including type 2 diabetes of polyphenols in 2007-2008, a number of related original publications have been pulished in this field. This review summarizes important advances related to influence of dietary polyphenols and polyphenol-rich diets on preventing and managing type 2 diabetes, as well as diabetes-mediated changes in bioactivities of dietary polyphenols. It appears that anthocyanins or anthocyanin-rich food intake is related to the risk of type 2 diabetes, but there is no association for other polyphenol subclasses. It is discussed that procyanidins are more active when administered individually than when mixed with food. The benefits of dietary polyphenols for type 2 diabetes can be summarized as: protection of pancreatic β-cells against glucose toxicity, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, inhibition of α-amylases or α- glucosidases and thus decrease of starch digestion, and inhibition of advanced glycation end products formation. Moreover, type 2 diabetes also significantly influences the benefits of dietary polyphenols, although there are very limited studies have been conducted so far. How type 2 diabetes impacts the pharmacology of dietary polyphenols is not well understood. Comprehension of type 2 diabetes-mediated changes in pharmacokinetics and bioactivity of dietary polyphenols might lead to improve the benefits of these phytochemicals and subsequent clinical outcomes for type 2 diabetics.",Xiao JB; Högger P,Current medicinal chemistry,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25005188/,1,0,0,0,0,0
24959784,The role of Chromium III in the organism and its possible use in diabetes and obesity treatment.,"Diabetes and obesity are diseases characterized by their increasing incidence every year. When comparing with healthy subjects, the serum levels of chromium (Cr) are lowered in these two diseases. Several studies conducted in laboratory animals with experimentally- induced diabetes demonstrated that supplementation with chromium ions (III) decreased glucose concentration in the blood, reduced the probability of atherosclerosis and heart attack, lowered the levels of cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL). The Importance of chromium is actually challenged due to lack of clear manifestations of Cr deficiency in humans and animals. The aim of this review was to present current knowledge about Cr its role in the organism and possible mechanisms of its action also in metabolic disorders such as diabetes or obesity. In the last decade, Cr was established to be rather a beneficial than essential trace element in mammals, and has gained popularity as a nutritional supplement and a component of many multivitamin/mineral formulations, fortified food and energy drinks. Cr supplements are widespread for diabetes and obesity treatment, despite conflicting reports on its efficacy. It was suggested that Cr shows a beneficial influence upon glucose and lipid disturbances. The recent clinical trials provided evidence both in favor and against the importance of Cr in healthy and ill organisms. Unfortunately, also the molecular mechanism by which chromium affects glucose and lipid metabolism is still unclear. Beneficial effects of diet supplementation with different sources of Cr³⁺ can be potentially explained by rather pharmacological than nutritional effects.",Lewicki S; Zdanowski R; Krzyżowska M; Lewicka A; Dębski B; Niemcewicz M; Goniewicz M,Annals of agricultural and environmental medicine : AAEM,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24959784/,1,0,0,0,0,0
24957529,Iron deficiency: an emerging therapeutic target in heart failure.,"In patients with heart failure, iron deficiency is frequent but overlooked, with a prevalence of 30%-50%. Since it contributes to cardiac and peripheral muscle dysfunction, iron deficiency is associated with poorer clinical outcomes and a greater risk of death, independent of haemoglobin level. Therefore, iron deficiency emerges as a new comorbidity and a therapeutic target of chronic heart failure in addition to chronic renal insufficiency, anaemia and diabetes. In a series of placebo-controlled, randomised studies in patients with heart failure and iron deficiency, intravenous iron had a favourable effect on exercise capacity, functional class, LVEF, renal function and quality of life. These clinical studies were performed in the context of a renewed interest in iron metabolism. During the past 10 years, knowledge about the transport, storage and homeostasis of iron has improved dramatically, and new molecules involved in iron metabolism have been described (eg, hepcidin, ferroportin, divalent metal transporter 1). Recent European guidelines recommend the monitoring of iron parameters (ie, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation) for all patients with heart failure. Ongoing clinical trials will explore the benefits of iron deficiency correction on various heart failure parameters.",Cohen-Solal A; Leclercq C; Deray G; Lasocki S; Zambrowski JJ; Mebazaa A; de Groote P; Damy T; Galinier M,Heart (British Cardiac Society),2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24957529/,1,0,0,0,0,0
24925525,Vascular endothelial dysfunction and nutritional compounds in early type 1 diabetes.,"Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of death in patients with type 1 diabetes. Vascular endothelial dysfunction is an early pathophysiological precursor of cardiovascular disease. There is extensive evidence that hyperglycemia causes acute perturbations in endothelial function likely due to increases in oxidative damage. Interestingly, oscillating hyperglycemia may cause more damage than persistent hyperglycemia. Many, but not all, studies indicate that vascular endothelial dysfunction occurs early in the course of type 1 diabetes and is present even in adolescents. Ascorbic acid has been shown to diminish the acute effects of hyperglycemia on endothelial function in type 1 diabetes and in conjunction with euglycemia to restore endothelial function to normal values in adults with well-controlled diabetes. In vitro and in vivo animal evidence suggests potential benefit from two other small molecule antioxidants, nicotinamide and taurine. Early studies suggested that folate supplementation may improve endothelial function in adolescents with type 1 diabetes but this has not been confirmed by more recent studies. Epidemiological evidence suggests a possible role for vitamin D therapy although intervention studies in type 2 diabetes have yielded varying results and have not been done in type 1 diabetes. Further exploration of these and other compounds is clearly appropriate if we are to reduce cardiovascular risk in type 1 diabetes.",Hoffman RP,Current diabetes reviews,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24925525/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Ezzati, E. Riboli, Science- 2012, 337, 1482-1487; S. Smyth, A. Heron, Nat. Med.- 2006, 12, 75). Despite considerable investment in the development of new types of drugs, options for the treatment of many common diseases remain inadequate. If current trends prevail, the rising incidence of disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) will soon result in an unsustainable burden on society (World Health Organization Technical Report Series- 2000, 894, i-xii, 1-253). Given the difficulty of treating fully developed complex disorders, new strategies for early intervention and prevention of common diseases are of great interest. Dietary natural products with beneficial effects, such as the recently described antidiabetic and lipid-lowering amorfrutins, could pave the way for efficiently treating and preventing metabolic and other complex diseases (C. Weidner, et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA- 2012, 109, 7257-7262).",Sauer S,Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24899548/,1,0,0,0,0,0
24859729,Vitamin D and gestational diabetes: an update.,"Vitamin D status (which is involved in glucose homeostasis) is related to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). GDM is characterized by increased resistance to and impaired secretion of insulin and results in higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes including operative delivery, macrosomia, shoulder dystocia and neonatal hypoglycemia. Women with GDM and their babies are at increased risk for developing type II diabetes. International definitions of vitamin D deficiency and normality are inconsistent. Vitamin D deficiency is common in pregnant women particularly those with poor diets and who have dark skins living in temperate climes with lack of exposure to sunlight. Few interventional studies indicate that supplementation optimizes maternal vitamin D status or improves maternal glucose metabolism. Observational studies about maternal vitamin D status and risk of GDM are conflicting. This could be because of measurement of vitamin D or differences in population characteristics such as ethnicity, geographic location, gestational age at sampling and diagnostic criteria for GDM. Good-quality randomized controlled trials are required to determine whether vitamin D supplementation decreases the risk of GDM or improves glucose tolerance in diabetic women.",Joergensen JS; Lamont RF; Torloni MR,Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24859729/,1,0,0,0,0,0
24858736,Selenium supplementation and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"It is well documented that selenium (Se) is involved in the metabolism of glucose. However, whether Se supplementation could lower the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains elusive. We aimed to evaluate the association between Se supplementation and the risk of T2DM by performing a meta-analysis. We searched the Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane databases from January 1990 to November 2013 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that met pre-stated inclusion criteria. Reference lists of retrieved articles were also reviewed. Either a fixed-effects or, in the presence of heterogeneity, a random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled prevention effects. Four RCTs involving 20,294 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The combined relative risks (RRs) for subjects administered with Se compared with control groups were 1.09 (95 % CI: 0.99-1.20, p = 0.085). Omission of any single study did not change the overall risk estimates significantly. Meta- regression analyses showed almost no impact on the RRs of age and study length. No evidence of publication bias was observed. In conclusion, our findings do not support the routine application of Se supplementation for T2DM prevention in Caucasians. Larger studies are needed to investigate the effects of Se supplementation on T2DM prevention among various populations and further elucidate the impact of age and study length.",Mao S; Zhang A; Huang S,Endocrine,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24858736/,0,0,0,1,0,0

24824449,"Gut microbiota in older subjects: variation, health consequences and dietary intervention prospects.","Alterations in intestinal microbiota composition and function have been linked to conditions including functional gastrointestinal disorders, obesity and diabetes. The gut microbiome encodes metabolic capability in excess of that encoded by the human genome, and bacterially produced enzymes are important for releasing nutrients from complex dietary ingredients. Previous culture-based studies had indicated that the gut microbiota of older people was different from that of younger adults, but the detailed findings were contradictory. Small-scale studies had also shown that the microbiota composition could be altered by dietary intervention or supplementation. We showed that the core microbiota and aggregate composition in 161 seniors was distinct from that of younger persons. To further investigate the reasons for this variation, we analysed the microbiota composition of 178 elderly subjects for whom the dietary intake data were available. The data revealed distinct microbiota composition groups, which overlapped with distinct dietary patterns that were governed by where people lived: at home, in rehabilitation or in long-term residential care. These diet-microbiota separations correlated with cluster analysis of NMR-derived faecal metabolites and shotgun metagenomic data. Major separations in the microbiota correlated with selected clinical measurements. It should thus be possible to programme the microbiota to enrich bacterial species and activities that promote healthier ageing. A number of other studies have investigated the effect of certain dietary components and their ability to modulate the microbiota composition to promote health. This review will discuss dietary interventions conducted thus far, especially those in elderly populations and highlight their impact on the intestinal microbiota.",O'Connor EM; O'Herlihy EA; O'Toole PW,The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24824449/,1,0,0,0,0,0
24823922,Vitamin D supplementation for cystic fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder with multiorgan effects. In a subgroup with pancreatic insufficiency malabsorption of the fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) may occur. Vitamin D is involved in calcium homeostasis and bone mineralisation and may have extraskeletal effects. This review examines the evidence for vitamin D supplementation in cystic fibrosis. To assess the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the frequency of vitamin D deficiency, respiratory outcomes and vitamin D toxicity in the cystic fibrosis population. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.Date of the most recent search: 08 July 2013. Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled studies of vitamin D supplementation compared to placebo in the cystic fibrosis population regardless of exocrine pancreatic function. Both authors independently assessed the risk of bias of each included study and extracted outcome data (from published study information) for assessment of bone mineralization, growth and nutritional status, frequency of vitamin D deficiency, respiratory status, quality of life and adverse events. Six studies (239 participants) are included, although only three studies provided data from 69 adults and children with cystic fibrosis for analysis. One study compared a single high dose of vitamin D (250,000 IU) to placebo at the time of hospital admission with a respiratory exacerbation in 30 pancreatic insufficient adults with cystic fibrosis. The second study compared supplemental 800 international units (IU) vitamin D and placebo for 12 months in 30 osteopenic pancreatic insufficient adults; both groups continued 900 IU vitamin D daily. The third study compared supplemental 1 g calcium alone, 1600 IU vitamin D alone, 1600 IU vitamin D and 1 g calcium and placebo in a double-blind randomised cross-over study; only nine children who completed both vitamin D and placebo groups after six-months supplementation and a three-month washout period are included; pancreatic sufficiency or disease status of participants are not defined. The studies are not directly comparable due to differences in supplementation, outcome reporting and possibly participant characteristics (e.g. severity of lung disease, growth and nutrition, pancreatic sufficiency).The only outcome for which we could combine data from more than two studies was 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels; patients receiving vitamin D supplementation had significantly higher levels, mean difference 7.24 ng/ml (95% confidence interval 5.01 to 9.46). However, ironically one study reported 1,25(OH)2D with levels significantly favouring the placebo group, mean difference -30.30 pmol/ml (95% confidence interval -59.89 to -0.71). Bone mineral density was measured in two studies; both described no significant change between groups. There were no adverse events in any study.The remaining three studies are published as abstracts only and did not provide data for analysis. These abstracts include: a report of pre-intervention data in a study comparing daily calcitriol (0.25 or 0.5 micrograms) with placebo in pancreatic insufficient children and young adults; an interim report of a double-blind randomised control study comparing 5000 IU vitamin D daily for 12 weeks during winter in 67 adult cystic fibrosis patients; and a comparison of the effect of three months of vitamin D supplementation (dose not specified) with placebo on bone mineral density in 42 children with cystic fibrosis and low bone mineral density.Risk of bias was highly variable between all studies. Only one study had a low risk of bias for the five main criteria (random sequence generation, allocation, blinding, attrition and reporting). The rest of the studies had unclear or high risks of bias. Two studies had a low risk of bias for blinding and another two studies for attrition bias. In the studies published as abstracts, assessment of the risks of bias was uncertain in many aspects. In patients receiving vitamin D supplementation, 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are significantly higher. However, there is no evidence of clinical benefit or harm in the limited number of small-sized published studies. Adherence to relevant cystic fibrosis guidelines on vitamin D supplementation should be considered until further evidence is available.",Ferguson JH; Chang AB,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24823922/,0,1,0,1,0,0
24776618,Vitamin D and diabetes mellitus.,"The vitamin D endocrine system in now recognized as subserving a wide range of fundamental biological functions in cell differentiation, inhibition of cell growth as well as immunomodulation. Both forms of immunity, namely adaptive and innate, are regulated by 1,25(OH)2D3. The immune-modulatory properties of vitamin D suggest that it could play a potential therapeutic role in prevention of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). It is postulated that large doses of vitamin D supplementation may influence the pattern of immune regulation and subsequent progression to T1DM in a genetically susceptible individual. More studies are required to substantiate the relation between T1DM and vitamin D/vitamin D analogues in the pattern of immune regulations in susceptible individuals. In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), vitamin D may influence both insulin secretion and sensitivity. An inverse relationship between T2DM and vitamin D is postulated from cross-sectional and prospective studies, though conclusive proof is as yet lacking. Available studies differ in their design and in the recommended daily allowances (RDA) of vitamin D in non-skeletal diseases and β-cell function. Large, well designed, controlled, randomized interventional studies on the potential role of vitamin D and calcium in prevention and management of T2DM are required to clarify the relationship between vitamin D and glucose homeostasis in T2DM.",Harinarayan CV,"Hormones (Athens, Greece)",2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24776618/,1,0,0,0,0,0
24768505,Vitamin D supplementation and falls: a trial sequential meta-analysis.,"Vitamin D supplementation is often recommended to prevent falls, although vitamin D trials and meta-analyses of these trials have reported conflicting results for this outcome. We aimed to assess if there was a need for further research. We explored the value of doing further randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of vitamin D supplements on falls with trial sequential analysis with a risk reduction threshold of 15%. All analyses were done using the numbers of participants who had a fall in intention-to-treat analyses. Trial sequential analysis performs a cumulative meta-analysis, but reduces the risk of false-positive results from repetitive statistical testing by maintaining the overall risk of type 1 error at 5%. In 20 existing randomised controlled trials (n=29,535), the effect estimate for vitamin D with or without calcium on falls lay within the futility boundary, providing evidence that vitamin D supplementation does not alter the relative risk by 15% or more. In a sensitivity analysis using a risk reduction threshold of 10%, the effect estimate also lay within the futility boundary. In subgroup analyses using a risk reduction threshold of 15%, the effect estimate also lay within the futility boundary for trials of vitamin D supplementation (16 trials, n=22,291) and trials of vitamin D with calcium (six trials, n=9919). In pooled analyses, supplementation with vitamin D, with or without calcium, does not reduce falls by 15% or more. Future trials with similar designs are unlikely to alter these conclusions. At present, there is little justification for prescribing vitamin D supplements to prevent falls. Health Research Council of New Zealand.",Bolland MJ; Grey A; Gamble GD; Reid IR,The lancet.

In particular, recent reports have highlighted the benefits of these compounds in the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes and associated life-threatening complications, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nephropathy, retinopathy, and atherosclerosis. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is of major concern since it is reaching global epidemic levels. Treatments targeting the signaling pathways altered in type 2 diabetes are being actively investigated, and OA and UA in natural and derivative forms are potential candidates to modulate these pathways. We will explore the findings from in vitro and in vivo studies showing that these compounds: (i) improve insulin signaling and reduce hyperglycemia; (ii) reduce oxidative stress by upregulating anti-oxidants and; (iii) reduce inflammation by inhibiting proinflammatory signaling.

24740143,Influence of vitamin E supplementation on glycaemic control: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.,"Observational studies have revealed that higher serum vitamin E concentrations and increased vitamin E intake and vitamin E supplementation are associated with beneficial effects on glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, whether vitamin E supplementation exerts a definitive effect on glycaemic control remains unclear. This article involves a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of vitamin E to better characterise its impact on HbA1c, fasting glucose and fasting insulin. PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library were electronically searched from the earliest possible date through April 2013 for all relevant studies. Weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated for net changes using fixed-effects or random-effects models. Standard methods for assessing statistical heterogeneity and publication bias were used. Fourteen randomised controlled trials involving individual data on 714 subjects were collected in this meta-analysis. Increased vitamin E supplementation did not result in significant benefits in glycaemic control as measured by reductions in HbA1c, fasting glucose and fasting insulin. Subgroup analyses revealed a significant reduction in HbA1c (-0.58%, 95% CI -0.83 to -0.34) and fasting insulin (-9.0 pmol/l, 95% CI -15.90 to -2.10) compared with controls in patients with low baseline vitamin E status. Subgroup analyses also demonstrated that the outcomes may have been influenced by the vitamin E dosage, study duration, ethnic group, serum HbA1c concentration, and fasting glucose control status. In conclusion, there is currently insufficient evidence to support a potential beneficial effect of vitamin E supplementation on improvements of HbA1c and fasting glucose and insulin concentrations in subjects with T2DM.",Xu R; Zhang S; Tao A; Chen G; Zhang M,PloS one,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24740143/,0,0,0,1,0,0

24720591,Polyunsaturated fatty acids in pregnancy and metabolic syndrome: a review.,"This review presents available evidence for possible application of n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in pregnant obese women with metabolic syndrome (MS) and focuses on prophylaxis of pregnancy complications associated with MS such as gestational hypertension, preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. Dietary supplementation with n-3 PUFAs has recently become popular and their adequate intake during pregnancy and early childhood is of clinical importance. The results of experimental and epidemiological investigations reveal that n-3 PUFAs, especially α- linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), may decrease the risk of cardiovascular diseases. It is believed that n-3 PUFAs affect a multitude of molecular pathways, involving regulation of gene expression, alteration of physical and chemical properties of cellular membranes and modulation of membrane channels and proteins. A large body of evidence focuses on anti-inflammatory properties of PUFAs which seem to be fundamental in prevention and reversing of insulin resistance, atherogenic dyslipidemia, hypertension, thromboembolism and in improving vascular function. Despite the potential PUFAs benefits of decreasing insulin resistance, their application in order to prevent preeclampsia, gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes mellitus in pregnant women with MS has not yet been established. Numerous reports have revealed that appropriate fetal development, including neuronal, retinal and immune function depends on EPA and DHA which are crucial also for prevention of preterm birth. Thus the supplementation with EPA and DHA is highly recommended during pregnancy although the optimal dosing and treatment strategies still need to be determined.",Poniedzialek-Czajkowska E; Mierzynski R; Kimber-Trojnar Z; Leszczynska-Gorzelak B; Oleszczuk J,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24720591/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Some investigators suggest that more clinical trials to test the effect of vitamin D on disorders are needed. We did a trial sequential meta-analysis of existing randomised controlled trials of vitamin D supplements, with or without calcium, to investigate the possible effect of future trials on current knowledge. We estimated the effects of vitamin D supplementation on myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, stroke or cerebrovascular disease, cancer, total fracture, hip fracture, and mortality in trial sequential analyses using a risk reduction threshold of 5% for mortality and 15% for other endpoints. The effect estimate for vitamin D supplementation with or without calcium for myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease (nine trials, 48 647 patients), stroke or cerebrovascular disease (eight trials 46 431 patients), cancer (seven trials, 48 167 patients), and total fracture (22 trials, 76 497 patients) lay within the futility boundary, indicating that vitamin D supplementation does not alter the relative risk of any of these endpoints by 15% or more. Vitamin D supplementation alone did not reduce hip fracture by 15% or more (12 trials, 27 834 patients). Vitamin D co-administered with calcium reduced hip fracture in institutionalised individuals (two trials, 3853 patients) but did not alter the relative risk of hip fracture by 15% or more in community-dwelling individuals (seven trials, 46 237 patients). There is uncertainty as to whether vitamin D with or without calcium reduces the risk of death (38 trials, 81 173). Our findings suggest that vitamin D supplementation with or without calcium does not reduce skeletal or non-skeletal outcomes in unselected community-dwelling individuals by more than 15%.

We performed a strategic literature search of PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library (updated to March 2014) for randomized controlled trials that estimated the effects of resveratrol on glucose control and insulin sensitivity. Study quality was assessed by using the Jadad scale. Weighted mean differences were calculated for net changes in glycemic measures by using fixed-effects or random-effects models. We performed prespecified subgroup and sensitivity analyses to evaluate potential heterogeneity. Meta-regression analyses were conducted to investigate dose effects of resveratrol on fasting glucose and insulin concentrations in nondiabetic subjects. Eleven studies comprising a total of 388 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. Resveratrol consumption significantly reduced fasting glucose, insulin, glycated hemoglobin, and insulin resistance (measured by using the homeostatic model assessment) levels in participants with diabetes. No significant effect of resveratrol on glycemic measures of nondiabetic participants was found in the meta-analysis. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses indicated that the pooled effects of resveratrol on fasting glucose and insulin concentrations in nondiabetic participants were not affected by body mass index, study design, resveratrol dose, study duration, or Jadad score. Resveratrol significantly improves glucose control and insulin sensitivity in persons with diabetes but does not affect glycemic measures in nondiabetic persons.

Pure isoquercitrin can now be obtained on a large scale by enzymatic rutin hydrolysis with α-l-rhamnosidase. Isoquercitrin has higher bioavailability than quercetin and displays a number of chemoprotective effects both in vitro and in vivo, against oxidative stress, cancer, cardiovascular disorders, diabetes and allergic reactions. Although small amounts of intact isoquercitrin can be found in plasma and tissues after oral application, it is extensively metabolized in the intestine and the liver. Biotransformation of isoquercitrin includes deglycosylation, followed by formation of conjugated and methylated derivatives of quercetin or degradation to phenolic acids and carbon dioxide. The acceptable daily intake of (95%) isoquercitrin and of EMIQ was estimated to be 5.4 and 4.9mg/kg/day, respectively. Adverse effects of higher doses in rats included mostly (benign) chromaturia; nevertheless some drug interactions may occur due to the modulation of the activity and/or expression of drug metabolizing/transporting systems.

Results of previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses of chromium supplementation and metabolic profiles in diabetes have been inconsistent. Recently, several published trials have emerged. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects on metabolic profiles and safety of chromium supplementation in diabetes mellitus. Clinical trials were identified through MEDLINE, the Cochrane library, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus and www.clinicaltrial.gov up to May 2013. Historical search of reference lists of related articles was also conducted. Studies were included if they (i) were randomized controlled trials comparing chromium mono- or combined supplementation against placebo, (ii) reported HbA1c or fasting plasma glucose and (iii) were of at least 3 weeks when reporting fasting plasma glucose, or of at least 8 weeks if HbA1c was reported. No language restriction was imposed. Treatment effect and adverse events were estimated with mean difference and odds ratio, respectively. Twenty-five randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 22 studies evaluated chromium monosupplementation. One study evaluated chromium yeast combined with vitamins C and E, and two others evaluated chromium picolinate plus biotin (CPB). Overall, chromium mono- and combined supplementation significantly improved glycaemic control (mean difference for HbA1c -0·55%; 95% CI -0·88 to -0·22%; P = 0·001, mean difference for FPG -1·15 mm; 95% CI -1·84 to -0·47 mm; P = 0·001). In particular, chromium monotherapy significantly reduced triglycerides and increased HDL-C levels. The effects on glucose and triglycerides levels were shown especially with chromium picolinate. Glycaemic control may improve with chromium monosupplementation of more than 200 μg daily. HbA1c and FPG also improved in patients with inadequate glycaemic control at baseline. The risk of adverse events did not differ between chromium and placebo. The available evidence suggests favourable effects of chromium supplementation on glycaemic control in patients with diabetes. Chromium monosupplement may additionally improve triglycerides and HDL-C levels. Chromium supplementation at usual doses does not increase the risk of adverse events compared with placebo.

In India, widely consumed food items such as dairy products are rarely fortified with vitamin D. Indian socioreligious and cultural practices do not facilitate adequate sun exposure, thereby negating potential benefits of plentiful sunshine. Consequently, subclinical vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in both urban and rural settings, and across all socioeconomic and geographic strata. Vitamin D deficiency is likely to play an important role in the very high prevalence of rickets, osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer and infections such as tuberculosis in India.

An excessive energy intake is undesirable since maternal overweight and excessive weight gain can increase the risks for a high birth weight and later child overweight and diabetes. Maternal weight at the beginning of pregnancy is especially important for pregnancy outcome and child health. Women should strive to achieve normal weight already before pregnancy. Regular physical activity can contribute to a healthy weight and to the health of pregnant women. The need for certain nutrients increases more than energy requirements. Before and during pregnancy, foods with a high content of essential nutrients should be preferentially selected.

24499118,Black tea polyphenols: a mechanistic treatise.,"Dietary interventions are among the emerging trends to curtail physiological malfunctioning like cancer, diabetes, cardiac complications, etc. The essence of phytonutrients has developed the concept of nutraceuticals at the junction of diet health linkages. In this context, theaflavin & thearubigins are the oxidized derivatives of black tea catechins during fermentation having nutraceutical potential owing to esterification of hydroxyl ring with digallate esters. Theaflavin may influence activation of transcription factors such as NFnB or AP-1 that ultimately hinder the formation of nitric oxide expression gene. Likewise, black tea contains a unique amino acid theanine acts as neurotransmitter owing to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Moreover, it boasts immunity by enhancing the disease-fighting ability of gamma delta T cells. Theaflavin & thearubigins act as safeguard against oxidative stress thereby effective in the cardiac functioning. The mechanistic approach of these antioxidants is likely to be associated with inhibition of redox sensitive transcription factors & pro-oxidant enzymes such as xanthine oxidase or nitric oxide synthase. However, their involvement in antioxidative enzyme induction as in glutathione-S-transferases is also well documented. They act as curative agent against numerous pathological disorders by disrupting the electron chain thus inhibiting the progression of certain ailments. Black tea polyphenols established themselves as strong antioxidants due to their standard one-electron potential, and their vitality is dependent on the concentration of polyphenols and pH for their inclusive execution. Present review is an attempt to enrich the readers regarding the health promoting aspects of black tea polyphenols.

24499073,Multiple functional ingredient approach in formulating dietary supplement for management of diabetes: a review.,"Food and nutrition science has moved from identifying and correcting nutritional deficiencies to designing foods that promote optimal health and reduce the risk of disease. Diabetes is rapidly emerging as a pandemic. It is also accompanied by several health implications viz. cardiovascular diseases, obesity, hypertension, cancer, depression, and eating disorders. International Diabetes Federation estimates that in 2010, India is home to 50.8 million diabetics and the number is expected to go up to a whopping 87 million by 2030. The primary goal of medical nutrition therapy was to design special dietary products for patients with hyperglycemia, intended in controlling postprandial plasma glucose fluctuations and hypercholesterolemic tendencies. However, an effective way to minimize these health risks could be through modifications in the diet by inclusion of multiple functional ingredients, aimed for their concerted role in management of individuals suffering with diabetes.",Pawar K; Thompkinson DK,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24499073/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Evidence of changes in trace mineral and vitamin metabolism as a consequence of type 2 diabetes is reviewed in this chapter. This review is not a meta-analysis but an overview of the micronutrient status, metabolic needs, and potential micronutrient requirements in type 2 diabetics. This chapter will not concentrate on vitamin D and type 2 diabetes as this is a topic that has been extensively reviewed before. The less well-known micronutrients notably zinc, magnesium, chromium, copper, manganese, iron, selenium, vanadium, B-group vitamins, and certain antioxidants are assessed. While some evidence is available to demonstrate the positive influence of micronutrient supplementation on glycemic control, much remains to be investigated. Additional research is necessary to characterize better biomarkers of micronutrient status and requirements in type 2 diabetics. The optimal level of micronutrient supplementation to achieve glucose homeostasis in type 2 diabetics remains a challenge.",Kaur B; Henry J,Advances in food and nutrition research,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24484939/,1,0,0,0,0,0
24484208,Effect of dietary supplementation of black seed (N. Sativa L.) on lipid profile of patients suffering from diabetes.,"Diabetes is a chronic metabolic problem closely related to cardiovascular disease leading to premature death. Dyslipidemia is an important risk factor responsible for cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes. This paper is based on review of articles published to observe the effect of N. Sativa (black seed) on lipid levels in patients suffering from Diabetes Mellitus. A search of indexed papers and clinical trials was done using MEDLINE and PubMed and Cochrane search engine. All studies assessing the effect of N. Sativa ingestion on lipid levels among diabetics (animal or human) were included. A total of 12 trials (6 human studies and 6 animal studies) fulfilling the inclusion criteria were reviewed. Majority of human and animal trials done among humans and animals with diabetes or metabolic syndrome demonstrated reduction in weight and improvement in serum lipid levels including decrease total lipids, triglycerides, LDL levels. However, increase in HDL level showed questionable results. N. Sativa L and its different preparations can be used as an adjuvant with lipid lowering drugs for control of lipids however its role as a main therapeutic agent cannot be recommended and more metanalysis using standardized preparations with a close watch on methodological short falls is suggested to prove its role.",Qidwai W; Ashfaq T,Anti-inflammatory & anti-allergy agents in medicinal chemistry,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24484208/,1,0,0,0,0,0
24451224,Maternal dietary omega-3 fatty acids and placental function.,"The developing fetus requires substantial amounts of fatty acids to support rapid cellular growth and activity. Although the fatty acid composition delivered to the fetus is largely determined by maternal circulating levels, the placenta preferentially transfers physiologically important long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), particularly omega-3 (n-3) PUFAs. Maternal dietary supplementation with n-3 PUFAs during pregnancy has been shown to increase gestation length, enhance fetal growth, and reduce the risk of pregnancy complications, although the precise mechanisms governing these effects remain uncertain. Omega-3 PUFAs are involved in several physiological pathways which could account for these effects, including anti-inflammatory, pro-resolving, and anti-oxidative pathways. Recent studies have shown that maternal dietary n-3 PUFA supplementation during rat pregnancy can reduce placental oxidative damage and increase placental levels of pro-resolving mediators, effects associated with enhanced fetal and placental growth. Because several placental disorders, such as intrauterine growth restriction, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes mellitus, are associated with heightened placental inflammation and oxidative stress, there is considerable interest in the potential for dietary n-3 PUFAs as a therapeutic intervention for these disorders. In this study, we review the impact of dietary n-3 PUFAs on placental function, with particular focus on placental inflammation, inflammatory resolution, and oxidative stress.",Jones ML; Mark PJ; Waddell BJ,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24451224/,1,0,0,0,0,0
24439680,Small molecule SIRT1 activators for the treatment of aging and age-related diseases.,"Recent studies in mice have identified single molecules that can delay multiple diseases of aging and extend lifespan. In theory, such molecules could prevent dozens of diseases simultaneously, potentially extending healthy years of life. In this review, we discuss recent advances, controversies, opportunities, and challenges surrounding the development of SIRT1 activators, molecules with the potential to delay aging and age-related diseases. Sirtuins comprise a family of NAD⁺-dependent deacylases that are central to the body's response to diet and exercise. New studies indicate that both natural and synthetic sirtuin activating compounds (STACs) work via a common allosteric mechanism to stimulate sirtuin activity, thereby conferring broad health benefits in rodents, primates, and possibly humans. The fact that two-thirds of people in the USA who consume multiple dietary supplements consume resveratrol, a SIRT1 activator, underscores the importance of understanding the biochemical mechanism, physiological effects, and safety of STACs.",Hubbard BP; Sinclair DA,Trends in pharmacological sciences,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24439680/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25929019,[Genetic rat models of type 2 diabetes for evaluation the effectiveness of minor biologically active food substances].,"The purposeful use of plant minor biologically active food substances (with demonstrated evident hypoglycemic, hypocholesterolemic and antioxidant action) in the composition of specialized dietary products can become the inno- vative approach for the dietary treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Clinical testing of minor biologically active food substances of plant origin and their further use in the composition of specialized dietary products should be preceded by the stage of complex physiological and biochemical studies in vivo. It all turns on the question: to which extent the results obtained with the biomodel can be extrapolated on the human body. Hence, this review comparatively evaluates the rat models of type 2 diabetes. In this paper, we overview the most frequently used monogenic models of obesity with the damage of the leptin signaling path- way, when the animal loses control over saturation, hyperphagia and subsequent obesity appear. We describe polygenic models of obesity-related diabetes with fatty rats, which are more approximated to type 2 diabetes mellitus in humans. The characteristic of the type 2 diabetes model without obesity is given in the article: the SDT (Spontaneously Diabetic Torii) rats are genetically predisposed to glucose intolerance. Spontaneously Diabetic Torii-fa/fa (SDT fatty) rat is a new model of obese type 2 diabetes. Both male and female SDT fatty rats show overt obesity, and hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia are observed at a younger age as compared with SDTrats. In conclusion, the SDT fatty rats are useful as a model for the development of new drugs and/or specialized dietary products to reduce body fat mass.",Mazo VK; Murashev AN; Sidorova YS; Zorin SN; Kochetkova AA,Voprosy pitaniia,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25929019/,1,0,0,0,0,0
24352091,Does vitamin D sufficiency equate to a single serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level or are different levels required for non-skeletal diseases?,"Clarify the concept of vitamin D sufficiency, the relationship between efficacy and vitamin D status and the role of Vitamin D supplementation in the management of non-skeletal diseases. We outline reasons for anticipating different serum vitamin D levels are required for different diseases. Review the literature for evidence of efficacy of supplementation and minimum effective 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels in non-skeletal disease. Evidence of efficacy of vitamin supplementation is graded according to levels of evidence. Minimum effective serum 25-OHD levels are lower for skeletal disease, e.g., rickets (25 nmol/L), osteoporosis and fractures (50 nmol/L), than for premature mortality (75 nmol/L) or non-skeletal diseases, e.g., depression (75 nmol/L), diabetes and cardiovascular disease (80 nmol/L), falls and respiratory infections (95 nmol/L) and cancer (100 nmol/L). Evidence for the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation at serum 25-OHD levels ranging from 25 to 100 nmol/L has been obtained from trials with vitamin D interventions that change vitamin D status by increasing serum 25-OHD to a level consistent with sufficiency for that disease. This evidence supports the hypothesis that just as vitamin D metabolism is tissue dependent, so the serum levels of 25-OHD signifying deficiency or sufficiency are disease dependent.",Spedding S; Vanlint S; Morris H; Scragg R,Nutrients,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24352091/,1,0,0,0,0,0
24300739,Update on vitamin D during childhood.,"We propose to review several recent key clinically oriented topics related to vitamin D and health in children. We found a very large number of recent clinical studies related to vitamin D. However, most are association studies with few physiological or clinical trials that are adequately powered for clinical outcomes. Key results are available related to pulmonary disease and allergic disorders. Recent studies have also evaluated the relationship of vitamin D to bone health as well as new insights into genetic conditions related to vitamin D metabolism. Recent studies generally support the recommendations of the Institute of Medicine related to vitamin D intake but there is new and increasing evidence that some health conditions, such as pulmonary diseases in children, might benefit from close monitoring of vitamin D status. However, controlled trials are mostly lacking and there is an inadequate basis from recent studies to recommend high dose vitamin D pending the results of controlled trials.",Abrams SA; Tiosano D,"Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity",2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24300739/,1,0,0,0,0,0
24293356,Improved meta-analytic methods show no effect of chromium supplements on fasting glucose.,"The trace mineral chromium has been extensively researched over the years in its role in glucose metabolism. Dietary supplement companies have attempted to make claims that chromium may be able to treat or prevent diabetes. Previous meta-analyses/systematic reviews have indicated that chromium supplementation results in a significant lowering of fasting glucose in diabetics but not in nondiabetics. A meta-analysis was conducted using an alternative measure of effect size, d(ppc2) in order to account for changes in the control group as well as the chromium group. The literature search included MEDLINE, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and previously published article reviews, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. Included studies were randomized, placebo-controlled trials in the English language with subjects that were nonpregnant adults, both with and without diabetes. Sixteen studies with 809 participants (440 diabetics and 369 nondiabetics) were included in the analysis. Screening for publication bias indicated symmetry of the data. Tests of heterogeneity indicated the use of a fixed-effect model (I² = 0 %). The analysis indicated that there was no significant effect of chromium supplementation in diabetics or nondiabetics, with a weighted average effect size of 0.02 (SE = 0.07), p = 0.787, CI 95 % = -0.12 to 0.16.

24292820,"Vitamin D supplementation, body weight and human serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D response: a systematic review.","There is considerable variation in incremental circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels on vitamin D supplements, even when similar age groups and identical vitamin D doses are compared. We therefore aimed to investigate the importance of body weight for the dose-response relation in circulating 25OHD. We performed a systematic review of randomized placebo-controlled vitamin D supplementation trials in all age groups ≥10 years to clarify the influence of body weight and other parameters on incremental circulating 25OHD levels (difference between baseline and in-study values) in vitamin D-deficient and non-deficient individuals. We included 144 cohorts from 94 independent studies, published from 1990 to November 2012, in our systematic review. There was a logarithmic association between vitamin D dose per kg body weight per day and increment in circulating 25OHD. In multivariable regression analysis, vitamin D dose per kg body weight per day could explain 34.5% of variation in circulating 25OHD. Additional significant predictors were type of supplement (vitamin D2 or vitamin D3), age, concomitant intake of calcium supplements and baseline 25OHD, explaining 9.8, 3.7, 2.4 and 1.9%, respectively, of the variation in circulating 25OHD. This systematic review demonstrates that body weight is an important predictor of variation in circulating 25OHD in cohorts on vitamin D supplements. Our model provides an estimate of the daily vitamin D dose that is necessary for achieving adequate circulating 25OHD levels in vitamin D-insufficient or vitamin D-deficient individuals/cohorts with different body weights and ages.",Zittermann A; Ernst JB; Gummert JF; Börgermann J,European journal of nutrition,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24292820/,0,1,0,0,0,0

Emerging evidence suggests that Vitamin D administration can improve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, but whether vitamin D supplementation can prevent GDM is unknown. Observational studies provide conflicting evidence as to whether low serum 25-hydroxyvitmain D (25(OH)D) levels are associated with GDM. Two recent systematic reviews concluded that vitamin D deficiency is associated with a higher risk of GDM. However, these reviews are limited by the observational and diverse nature of the included studies. Of greatest concern is the inability to understand how important confounding variables such as race/ethnicity and adiposity might affect the association. Randomized controlled trial data remain limited but are critical to understanding whether supplementation with vitamin D beyond what is contained in routine prenatal vitamins will prevent GDM or improve glucose tolerance for women with GDM.",Burris HH; Camargo CA,Current diabetes reports,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24277676/,1,0,0,0,0,0
24273224,Pharmaceutical and nutraceutical approaches for preventing liver carcinogenesis: chemoprevention of hepatocellular carcinoma using acyclic retinoid and branched-chain amino acids.,"The poor prognosis for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is associated with its high rate of recurrence in the cirrhotic liver. Therefore, more effective strategies need to be urgently developed for the chemoprevention of this malignancy. The malfunction of retinoid X receptor α, a retinoid receptor, due to phosphorylation by Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase is closely associated with liver carcinogenesis and may be a promising target for HCC chemoprevention. Acyclic retinoid (ACR), a synthetic retinoid, can prevent HCC development by inhibiting retinoid X receptor α phosphorylation and improve the prognosis for this malignancy. Supplementation with branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), which are used to improve protein malnutrition in patients with liver cirrhosis, can also reduce the risk of HCC in obese cirrhotic patients. In experimental studies, both ACR and BCAA exert suppressive effects on HCC development and the growth of HCC cells. In particular, combined treatment with ACR and BCAA cooperatively inhibits the growth of HCC cells. Furthermore, ACR and BCAA inhibit liver tumorigenesis associated with obesity and diabetes, both of which are critical risk factors for HCC development. These findings suggest that pharmaceutical and nutraceutical approaches using ACR and BCAA may be promising strategies for preventing HCC and improving the prognosis of this malignancy.",Shimizu M; Shirakami Y; Hanai T; Imai K; Suetsugu A; Takai K; Shiraki M; Moriwaki H,Molecular nutrition & food research,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24273224/,1,0,0,0,0,0
24228193,Recent developments in multivitamin/mineral research.,"The 2010 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee was charged with the task of investigating the effects of multivitamin/mineral supplements on healthy populations and also on those with chronic disease. The evidence from which the committee prepared its conclusions was graded on 5 fundamental criteria: quality, consistency, quantity, clinical impact, and generalizability. The committee concluded that for the general healthy population, evidence was insufficient to make a multivitamin/mineral recommendation. On the other hand, the committee noted the value of some supplemental nutrients for at-risk populations such as iron, folic acid, and vitamin B-12. However, most of the studies referenced for the research used the conventional, all-encompassing, and oversimplified definition of a multivitamin/mineral as being a supplement containing 3 or more vitamins with or without minerals. In the few years since the committee released its 2010 report, several randomized clinical trials showing the benefits of daily multivitamin/mineral supplementation have been completed using supplements containing at least 10 or more vitamins and/or minerals, but there also continues to be some reports that do not find benefit from such supplements. Furthermore, several steps have been taken to advance the science behind these supplements so that consumers, physicians, and government agencies can all have more confidence in understanding the role of supplemental nutrition in the American diet. This review provides new evidence from 2010 onward addressing the committee's primary concerns about multivitamin/mineral research in regard to improving public health. It also includes several recent studies that may be of interest to future committees indicating the potential benefits of these supplements on improving the cognitive performance and mental well-being of healthy populations.",Comerford KB,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24228193/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of green tea or green tea extract on insulin sensitivity and glycaemic control in populations at risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Electronic databases, including PUBMED, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, ISI Web of Knowledge, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database and Chinese Scientific Journals Fulltext Database, were systematically searched to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) up to December 2011, supplemented by the Clinicaltrials.gov websites and the reference lists of identified studies. Two reviewers independently selected trials, extracted data, and evaluated the methodological qualities and evidence levels. Seven RCTs involving 510 participants were identified. There was no statistically significant difference between green tea or green tea extract group and placebo group with regard to fasting plasma glucose [standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.04; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.15 to 0.24], fasting serum insulin (SMD -0.09; 95% CI -0.30 to 0.11), 2-h plasma glucose in the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT-2 h) (SMD -0.14; 95% CI -0.63 to 0.34), haemoglobin A₁c (SMD 0.10; 95% CI -0.13 to 0.33) and homeostasis model of insulin resistance (HOMA(IR)) index (SMD -0.06; 95% CI -0.35 to 0.23) in participants at risk of T2DM. The consumption of green tea did not decrease the levels of fasting plasma glucose, fasting serum insulin, OGTT-2 h glucose, haemoglobin A₁c and HOMA(IR) in populations at risk of T2DM. Larger, longer-term and high-quality RCTs are needed to further definitely determine the effect of green tea or green tea extract on insulin sensitivity and glycaemic control in populations at risk of T2DM.",Wang X; Tian J; Jiang J; Li L; Ying X; Tian H; Nie M,Journal of human nutrition and dietetics : the official journal of the British Dietetic Association,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24206044/,0,1,0,1,0,0

A comprehensive literature search resulted in 37 studies of prenatal probiotics and 1 on antepartal prebiotics published from 1990 through 2011 that reported maternal, fetal, and/or neonatal outcomes. The methodologic quality of the studies reviewed was high, although investigators used different probiotic combinations and inconsistently reported perinatal clinical outcomes. The extraction of perinatal outcome variables resulted in identification of 9 maternal and 5 neonatal categories. Prenatal probiotics significantly reduced the incidence of bacterial vaginosis, increased colonization with vaginal Lactobacillus and intestinal Lactobacillus rhamnosus, altered immune markers in serum and breast milk, improved maternal glucose metabolism, and reduced the incidence of gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. Antepartally, probiotics were associated with significantly higher counts of Bifidobacterium and Lactococcus lactis (healthy intestinal flora) in neonatal stool. Prenatal prebiotics significantly increased maternal intestinal Bifidobacterium. No adverse events were reported and there was evidence of safety and tolerance of prenatal probiotics and prebiotics in the scientific investigations reviewed. It is recommended that in future investigations of prenatal probiotics researchers explicitly report maternal and neonatal outcomes.",VandeVusse L; Hanson L; Safdar N,The Journal of perinatal & neonatal nursing,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24164813/,1,0,0,0,0,0

There have been several important findings in the field of postmenopausal osteoporosis over the past 1-2 years. Fewer morphometric vertebral fractures were found in women treated for 6 years with zoledronic acid compared with those who stopped treatment after 3 years. Longer duration of bisphosphonate therapy is associated with a higher risk of atypical femur fractures. Combination therapy with teriparatide and denosumab appears to increase bone mineral density to a greater extent than either therapy alone in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture. There are several novel therapies under investigation for the treatment of osteoporosis, which are in various stages of development. Nonadherence to osteoporosis therapies continues to be a major problem in clinical practice. There are numerous effective pharmacologic treatment options for postmenopausal osteoporosis.

This paper first provides an overview of landmark events of the past few decades that have been driving the search for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical compounds that would increase BAT thermogenesis for obesity management. It then addresses issues about what could be expected from an ideal thermogenic antiobesity approach, in particular to what extent daily energy expenditure will need to increase in order to achieve long-term weight loss currently achievable only through bariatric surgery, and whether the human body will have enough thermogenic capacity to reach this target weight loss by future therapies focused on BAT.",Dulloo AG,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24138104/,1,0,0,0,0,0
24129365,Omega-3 fatty acids: a review of the effects on adiponectin and leptin and potential implications for obesity management.,"An increase in adiposity is associated with altered levels of biologically active proteins. These include the hormones adiponectin and leptin. The marked change in circulating concentrations of these hormones in obesity has been associated with the development of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Variations in dietary lipid consumption have also been shown to impact obesity. Specifically, omega-3 fatty acids have been correlated with the prevention of obesity and subsequent development of chronic disease sequalae. This review explores animal and human data relating to the effects of omega-3 fatty acids (marine lipids) on adiponectin and leptin, considering plausible mechanisms and potential implications for obesity management. Current evidence suggests a positive, dose-dependent relationship between omega-3 fatty acid intake and circulating levels of adiponectin. In obese subjects, this may translate into a reduced risk of developing cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome and diabetes. In non-obese subjects, omega-3 is observed to decrease circulating levels of leptin; however, omega-3-associated increases in leptin levels have been observed in obese subjects. This may pose benefits in the prevention of weight regain in these subjects following calorie restriction.",Gray B; Steyn F; Davies PS; Vitetta L,European journal of clinical nutrition,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24129365/,1,0,0,0,0,0
24124024,Modeling anterior development in mice: diet as modulator of risk for neural tube defects.,"Head morphogenesis is a complex process that is controlled by multiple signaling centers. The most common defects of cranial development are craniofacial defects, such as cleft lip and cleft palate, and neural tube defects, such as anencephaly and encephalocoele in humans. More than 400 genes that contribute to proper neural tube closure have been identified in experimental animals, but only very few causative gene mutations have been identified in humans, supporting the notion that environmental influences are critical. The intrauterine environment is influenced by maternal nutrition, and hence, maternal diet can modulate the risk for cranial and neural tube defects. This article reviews recent progress toward a better understanding of nutrients during pregnancy, with particular focus on mouse models for defective neural tube closure. At least four major patterns of nutrient responses are apparent, suggesting that multiple pathways are involved in the response, and likely in the underlying pathogenesis of the defects. Folic acid has been the most widely studied nutrient, and the diverse responses of the mouse models to folic acid supplementation indicate that folic acid is not universally beneficial, but that the effect is dependent on genetic configuration. If this is the case for other nutrients as well, efforts to prevent neural tube defects with nutritional supplementation may need to become more specifically targeted than previously appreciated. Mouse models are indispensable for a better understanding of nutrient-gene interactions in normal pregnancies, as well as in those affected by metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and obesity.",Kappen C,"American journal of medical genetics.

The aim of this study was to systematically review and quantify the effect of antioxidant vitamin supplementation on endothelial function in T2DM subjects. MEDLINE, Cochrane, Scopus and Web of Science were searched up to February 2013 for randomized controlled trials assessing the effect of antioxidant vitamin E and/or C supplementation on endothelial function in T2DM subjects. Ten randomized controlled trials comparing antioxidant vitamin-supplemented and control groups (overall n = 296) met the inclusion criteria. Post-intervention standardized mean difference (SMD) in endothelial function did not reach statistical significance between groups (0.35; 95% confidence interval = -0.17, 0.88; P = 0.18). In subgroup analysis, post-intervention endothelial function was significantly improved by antioxidant vitamin supplementation in T2DM subgroups with body mass index (BMI) ≤ 29.45 kg m(-2) (SMD = 1.02; P < 0.05), but not in T2DM subgroups with BMI > 29.45 kg m(-2) (SMD = -0.07; P = 0.70). In meta-regression, an inverse association was found between BMI and post-intervention SMD in endothelial function (B = -0.024, P = 0.02).

Almost 30% of people with diabetes aged 40 years or older experience DFUs caused by an impaired nerve sensation. It is one of the more persistent types of chronic wounds, which poses an economic burden on individuals and society and reduces the quality of life of patients and their families. This paper reviews the efficacy of nutrition supplementation in diabetic wound healing, including both human and animal studies. Using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methods, the search was conducted in PubMed and ISI's Web of Science databases. Studies in which diabetic wounds/foot ulcers were treated with specific nutritional or herbal suplements were selected. This review includes 4 human and 9 animal studies that met the criteria of the search. Positive outcomes in the human studies were not significant while the nutritional supplements used in the animal studies were effective and promoted wound healing. The most notable effect of supplementation with curcumin, L-Arginine, or vitamin E have been shown in animal sudies. More human studies need to be conducted to determine the efficacy of these nutritional supplements in promoting wound healing.",Maier HM; Ilich JZ; Kim JS; Spicer MT,Skinmed,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24053007/,0,1,0,0,0,0
24047934,Strategies in the nutritional management of gestational diabetes.,"Elucidating the optimal macronutrient composition for dietary management of gestational diabetes mellitus has enormous potential to improve perinatal outcomes. Diet therapy may result in significant cost savings if effective in deterring the need for expensive medical management within this growing population. In only 6 randomized controlled trials in 250 women, data suggest that a diet higher in complex carbohydrate and fiber, low in simple sugar, and lower in saturated fat may be effective in blunting postprandial hyperglycemia, preventing worsened insulin resistance and excess fetal growth. The use of diet in gestational diabetes mellitus remains an area in grave need for high-quality randomized controlled trials.",Hernandez TL; Anderson MA; Chartier-Logan C; Friedman JE; Barbour LA,Clinical obstetrics and gynecology,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24047934/,1,0,0,0,0,0
24036529,Vitamin D intake and risk of type 1 diabetes: a meta-analysis of observational studies.,"Vitamin D is suggested to have protective effects against type 1 diabetes. However, the results from observational studies have been inconsistent. We aimed to examine their association by conducting a meta-analysis of observational studies. Multiple databases were searched in June 2013 to identify relevant studies including both case-control and cohort studies. Either a fixed- or random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled risk estimate. We identified eight studies (two cohort studies and six case-control studies) on vitamin D intake during early life and three studies (two cohort studies and one case-control study) on maternal vitamin D intake during pregnancy. The pooled odds ratio for type 1 diabetes comparing vitamin D supplementation with non-supplementation during early life was 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-0.98). Similar results were observed in the case-control subgroup analysis but not in the cohort subgroup analysis. The pooled odds ratio with maternal intake of vitamin D during pregnancy was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.66-1.36). In conclusion, vitamin D intake during early life may be associated with a reduced risk of type 1 diabetes. However, there was not enough evidence for an association between maternal intake of vitamin D and risk of type 1 diabetes in the offspring.",Dong JY; Zhang WG; Chen JJ; Zhang ZL; Han SF; Qin LQ,Nutrients,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24036529/,1,0,0,1,0,0

Data from epidemiological studies suggest a correlation between vitamin D deficiency and higher prevalence of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T1D and T2D). In animal models, vitamin D deficiency predisposes to diabetes whereas vitamin D supplementation prevents disease. Nevertheless, well-designed clinical intervention studies are lacking. We discuss here the evidence for a role of vitamin D in diabetes and propose that vitamin D deficiency should be avoided, especially in all at-risk people.

23964394,Zinc as a potential coadjuvant in therapy for type 2 diabetes.,"Type 2 diabetes is highly prevalent in populations having high rates of overweight and obesity. It is a chronic condition responsible for long-term severe dysfunction of several organs, including the kidneys, heart, blood vessels, and eyes. Although there are a number of pharmacologic products in the market to treat insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion--the most prominent features of this disease--interventions directed at preserving the integrity and function of beta-cells in the long term are less available. The use of some nutrients with important cellular protective roles that may lead to a preservation of beta-cells has not been fully tested; among these, zinc may be an interesting candidate. To assess the potential of zinc supplementation as coadjuvant to diabetes therapy. This article reviews the available information on the use of zinc as part of diabetes therapy. Cellular and animal models provide information on the insulin mimetic action of zinc, as well as its role as a regulator of oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and insulin secretion. Zinc supplementation studies in humans are limited, although some positive effects have been reported; mainly, a modest but significant reduction in fasting glucose and a trend to decreased glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Zinc supplementation may have beneficial effects on glycemic control. Nevertheless, among the studies considered, the vast majority lasted for 6 months or less, suggesting the importance of conducting long-duration studies given the characteristics of type 2 diabetes as a chronic disease.",Ruz M; Carrasco F; Rojas P; Codoceo J; Inostroza J; Basfi-fer K; Valencia A; Vásquez K; Galgani J; Pérez A; López G; Arredondo M; Perez-Bravo F,Food and nutrition bulletin,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23964394/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Vitamin D has long been known to be an essential part of bone metabolism, although recent evidence suggests that vitamin D plays a key role in the pathophysiology of other diseases, including CVD, as well. In this review, we aim to summarize the most recent data on the involvement of vitamin D deficiency in the development of major cardiovascular risk factors: hypertension, obesity and dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease and endothelial dysfunction. In addition, we outline the most recent observational, as well as interventional data on the influence of vitamin D on CVD. Since it is still an unresolved issue whether vitamin D deficiency is causally involved in the pathogenesis of CVD, data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) designed to assess the impact of vitamin D supplementation on cardiovascular outcomes are awaited with anticipation. At present, we can only conclude that vitamin D deficiency is an independent cardiovascular risk factor, but whether vitamin D supplementation can significantly improve cardiovascular outcomes is still largely unknown.",Kienreich K; Tomaschitz A; Verheyen N; Pieber T; Gaksch M; Grübler MR; Pilz S,Nutrients,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23912328/,1,0,0,0,0,0
23872396,Interference of selenium and selenoproteins with the insulin-regulated carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.,"An assumed link between supranutritional intake of the micronutrient selenium (Se) and type 2 diabetes mellitus is discussed controversially. Se concentrations in the habitual diet and in dietary supplements are probably not sufficient to induce overt diabetes in healthy individuals. On the other hand, high plasma Se and selenoprotein P (Sepp1) levels have been found to be associated with biomarkers of an impaired carbohydrate and lipid homeostasis in humans. Moreover, abundant expression of antioxidant selenoproteins due to dietary Se oversupply resulted in hyperinsulinemia and decreased insulin sensitivity in animal models. This review discusses findings from animal and cell culture studies in search of molecular mechanisms underlying an interference of Se and selenproteins such as the Se transport and supply protein Sepp1 and the hydrogen peroxide-reducing selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) with insulin-controlled metabolic pathways. A probable rationale derives from the positive and negative regulation of both glucose-induced insulin secretion and insulin-induced signaling by hydrogen peroxide. Se status and GPx1 expression have been reported to affect the activity of insulin-antagonistic phosphatases that are regulated by hydrogen peroxide-mediated reversible oxidation of catalytic cysteine residues. GPx1 and/or Sepp1 inhibited phosphorylation (activation) of key mediators in energy metabolism such as protein kinase B (Akt) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in liver and/or skeletal muscle. Conversely, a dys-regulated carbohydrate metabolism in diabetes might affect plasma Se and Sepp1 levels, as the hepatic biosynthesis of Sepp1 is suppressed by insulin and stimulated under hyperglycemic conditions.",Steinbrenner H,Free radical biology & medicine,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23872396/,1,0,0,0,0,0
23865865,Pharmacokinetic drug interactions involving Ginkgo biloba.,"Ginkgo biloba leaf extracts (GLEs) are popular herbal remedies for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia, tinnitus, vertigo and peripheral arterial disease. As GLEs are taken regularly by older people who are likely to also use multiple other drugs for the treatment of, e.g. hypertension, diabetes, rheumatism or heart failure, potential herb-drug interactions are of interest. Preclinical studies of high doses/concentrations of GLEs of varying quality and standardization hinted at both an inhibition and induction of metabolic enzymes and transporters. However, in humans, positive in vitro-findings could not be replicated in vivo. At maximum recommended doses of 240 mg/day, a clinically relevant interaction potential of the standardized GLE EGb 761 could not be shown. GLE doses higher than the recommended ones led to a weak induction of the CYP2C19-mediated omeprazole 5-hydroxylation, and a weak inhibition of the CYP3A4-mediated midazolam 1'-hydroxylation, respectively. Also, the regular intake of a poorly characterized GLE at a dose of 360 mg/day slightly increased the bioavailability of talinolol, a substrate of P-glycoprotein and various organic anion-transporting polypeptides. Thus, regarding pharmacokinetic herb-drug interactions, the intake of the standardized GLE, EGb 761, together with synthetic drugs appears to be safe as long as daily doses up to 240 mg are consumed. If this applies to other extracts prepared according to the European Pharmacopoeia remains uncertain. Also, a relevant potential for drug interactions cannot be excluded for poorly standardized GLEs used in many food supplements.",Unger M,Drug metabolism reviews,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23865865/,1,0,0,0,0,0
23859229,Water-soluble vitamins in people with low glomerular filtration rate or on dialysis: a review.,"People with low glomerular filtration rate and people on dialysis are spontaneously at risk for vitamin deficiency because of the potential for problems with decreased appetite and decreased sense of smell and taste, leading to decreased intake, and because decreased energy or decreased cognitive ability results in difficulties in shopping and cooking. Imposed dietary restrictions because of their renal dysfunction and because of comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes exacerbate this problem. Finally, particularly for water-soluble vitamins, loss may occur into the dialysate. We did not identify any randomized trials of administering daily doses close to the recommended daily allowances of these vitamins. In people who are eating at all, deficiencies of B5 and B7 seem unlikely. It is unclear whether supplements of B2 and B3 are necessary. Because of dialyzability and documented evidence of insufficiency in dialysis patients, B1 supplementation is likely to be helpful. B6, B9, and B12 are implicated in the hyperhomocysteinemia observed in patients on dialysis. These vitamins have been studied in combinations, in high doses, with the hope of reducing cardiovascular outcomes. No reductions in patient-important outcomes were seen in adequately powered randomized trials. Because of their involvement in the homocysteine pathway, however, supplementation with lower doses, close to the recommended daily allowances, may be helpful. Vitamin C deficiency is common in patients on dialysis who are not taking supplements: low-dose supplements are warranted. Vitamins for dialysis patients contain most or all of the B vitamins and low-dose vitamin C. We are not aware of any medical reasons to choose one over another.",Clase CM; Ki V; Holden RM,Seminars in dialysis,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23859229/,1,0,0,0,0,0

23770795,"The role of antioxidants in the pathophysiology, complications, and management of diabetes mellitus.","Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder that remains a major health problem in the world. It is characterized by relative or absolute deficiency of insulin secretion and/or insulin resistance that causes chronic hyperglycemia and impaired carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins metabolism. Diabetes has been known as an oxidative stress disorder caused by imbalance between free radical formation and the ability of the body's natural antioxidants. Many studies have suggested that oxidative stress play a role in systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, impaired secretion of pancreatic cells and impaired glucose utilization in peripheral tissues. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are at risk, intensive intervention with multiple drug combinations and lifestyle modifications showed a beneficial effect on vascular complications and reduce mortality rate due to cardiovascular disease and other causes. There has also been shown that neutralization of reactive molecules can significantly inhibit the development of endothelial dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy in patients with DM. Recently the use of antioxidants still remains a controversy, but its use as a therapy for DM can be considered because its demonstrated effectiveness in lowering the risk of developing diabetes and its complications. Various antioxidants have been developed for oxidative stress treatment in DM, including the use of vitamins and supplements as well as the use of some components of plants and fresh fruits which have demonstrated antioxidant effect in DM patients.

The hypothesis of selenium chemoprevention is principally formulated by the observations that cancer incidence is inversely associated with selenium status. However, recent clinical and epidemiological studies demonstrate a role for some selenoproteins in exacerbating or promoting other disease states, specifically type 2 diabetes, although other data support a role of selenium in stimulating insulin sensitivity. Therefore, it is clear that our understanding in the role of selenium in glucose metabolism and chemoprevention is inadequate and incomplete.

The progression of many metabolic diseases is fundamentally regulated on the transcriptional level by a family of ligand-activated transcription factors, called nuclear receptors, which detect and respond to metabolic changes. Their role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis makes nuclear receptors an important pharmaceutical and dietary target. This review will present the growing evidence that flavonoids, natural secondary plant metabolites, are important regulators of nuclear receptor activity. Structural similarities between flavonoids and cholesterol derivatives combined with the promiscuous nature of most nuclear receptors provide a wealth of possibilities for pharmaceutical and dietary modulation of metabolism. While the challenges of bringing flavonoid-derived therapeutics to the market are significant, we consider this rapidly growing field to be an essential aspect of the functional food initiative and an important mine for pharmaceutical compounds.",Avior Y; Bomze D; Ramon O; Nahmias Y,Food & function,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23598551/,1,0,0,0,0,0
23597503,Epidemiology of selenium and type 2 diabetes: can we make sense of it?,"The potential of some selenoproteins to protect against oxidative stress led to the expectation that selenium would be protective against type 2 diabetes, and indeed in early in vivo and in vitro studies, selenium (as selenate) was shown to have antidiabetic and insulin-mimetic effects. However, more recently, findings from observational cross-sectional studies have raised concern that high selenium exposure may be associated with type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance, at least in well-nourished populations, though trial results have been inconsistent. Moreover, the largest trials that investigated the effects of selenium supplementation on diabetes endpoints have had cancer prevention as their primary outcome, casting doubt on the interpretation of posthoc analyses. Factors affecting serum/plasma selenium are not just location and level of disease-associated inflammation but the fact that higher concentrations of plasma selenoprotein P yet lower concentrations of glutathione peroxidase are found in type 2 diabetic patients than in normal subjects. From a public health perspective, selenium is marketed as a dietary supplement and is commonly added to multivitamin/mineral preparations that are consumed in many Western countries. Based on current evidence, however, the indiscriminate use of selenium supplements in individuals and populations with adequate-to-high selenium status cannot be justified and may increase risk. In conclusion, although there is a clear link between certain selenoproteins and glucose metabolism or insulin resistance, the relationship between selenium and type 2 diabetes is undoubtedly complex. It is possible that the relationship is U-shaped, with possible harm occurring both below and above the physiological range for optimal activity of some or all selenoproteins.",Rayman MP; Stranges S,Free radical biology & medicine,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23597503/,1,0,0,0,0,0
23597388,"Current issues surrounding the definition of trans-fatty acids: implications for health, industry and food labels.","The definition of trans-fatty acids (TFA) was established by the Codex Alimentarius to guide nutritional and legislative regulations to reduce TFA consumption. Currently, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is excluded from the TFA definition based on evidence (primarily preclinical studies) implying health benefits on weight management and cancer prevention. While the efficacy of CLA supplements remains inconsistent in randomised clinical trials, evidence has emerged to associate supplemental CLA with negative health outcomes, including increased subclinical inflammation and oxidative stress (particularly at high doses). This has resulted in concerns regarding the correctness of excluding CLA from the TFA definition. Here we review recent clinical and preclinical literature on health implications of CLA and ruminant TFA, and highlight several issues surrounding the current Codex definition of TFA and how it may influence interpretation for public health. We find that CLA derived from ruminant foods differ from commercial CLA supplements in their isomer composition/distribution, consumption level and bioactivity. We conclude that health concerns associated with the use of supplemental CLA do not repudiate the exclusion of all forms of CLA from the Codex TFA definition, particularly when using the definition for food-related purposes. Given the emerging differential bioactivity of TFA from industrial v. ruminant sources, we advocate that regional nutrition guidelines/policies should focus on eliminating industrial forms of trans-fat from processed foods as opposed to all TFA per se.",Wang Y; Proctor SD,The British journal of nutrition,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23597388/,1,0,0,0,0,0

In addition, action on the main symptoms of MS by means of dietary supplements, can be helpful in view of the chronic course of the disease. The term 'phytosterols' refers to sterols and stanols composed of lipophilic triterpenes, a family that is widely distributed in the plant kingdom and whose cholesterol-lowering properties have been amply demonstrated. In the light of the recent literature, the key points for maximum effectiveness and safety of sterols are the following. (A) Plant sterols should be taken with meals: clinical trials have shown that when plant sterols are consumed close to mealtimes, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol may decrease by 9.4%, while when they are taken between meals, the reduction is about 6%. (B) The optimal dosage is 2-2.5 g day(-1) in a single dose. More than 3 g day(-1) has not been found to have any additional beneficial effect and increases the risk of side effects. (C) The food matrix used to dissolve the phytosterols should contain a certain amount of fat.

The aim of this review was to examine the role of several functional foods, or nutraceuticals, in the prevention or treatment of CHD. CHD continues to be one of the main causes of death in modern societies. Far from diminishing, its prevalence and incidence continue to grow and are probably linked to the increase in metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Numerous preventive measures and treatments are being considered for these metabolic diseases. In this context, nutraceuticals and functional foods are seen as powerful tools for maintaining health and fighting against cardiometabolic risk factors. For example, the association between saturated fat and the development of CHD has been clearly established. However, the consumption of other sources of fat, such as olive oil enriched in monounsaturated fatty acids, has been associated with beneficial cardiovascular effects.

23479117,Carnosine: from exercise performance to health.,"Carnosine was first discovered in skeletal muscle, where its concentration is higher than in any other tissue. This, along with an understanding of its role as an intracellular pH buffer has made it a dipeptide of interest for the athletic population with its potential to increase high-intensity exercise performance and capacity. The ability to increase muscle carnosine levels via β-alanine supplementation has spawned a new area of research into its use as an ergogenic aid. The current evidence base relating to the use of β-alanine as an ergogenic aid is reviewed here, alongside our current thoughts on the potential mechanism(s) to support any effect. There is also some emerging evidence for a potential therapeutic role for carnosine, with this potential being, at least theoretically, shown in ageing, neurological diseases, diabetes and cancer. The currently available evidence to support this potential therapeutic role is also reviewed here, as are the potential limitations of its use for these purposes, which mainly focusses on issues surrounding carnosine bioavailability.",Sale C; Artioli GG; Gualano B; Saunders B; Hobson RM; Harris RC,Amino acids,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23479117/,1,0,0,0,0,0
23475478,[Conjugated linoleic acid as a potential protective factor in prevention of breast cancer].,"Cancers are the second leading cause of deaths in Poland, among both women and men. Breast cancer is the malignancy most frequently diagnosed in women. In 2008 mammary cancer was diagnosed in up to 14 500 patients. It is also the second most common cause of cancer deaths among women in our country. Although the etiology of most cases of this disease is not known, risk factors include a variety of nutritional factors. The amount of fat consumed in the diet and the quantity and quality of fatty acids are especially crucial. Among fatty acids to which great importance in modification of cancer risk is attributed are conjugated linoleic acid. Conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) are a group of positional and geometric isomers of linoleic acid, with a conjugated double bond system in the carbon chain. The main natural source of them is milk and dairy products and meat of different species of ruminants, in which cis-9, trans-11 octadecadienoic acid (rumenic acid) occurs in the largest quantities, constituting over 90% of the total pool of CLA. Another important isomer is trans-10, cis-12 octadecadienoic acid, which occurs with rumenic acid in dietary supplements, usually in the ratio 1:1. Surveys conducted show their possible health promoting effects in obesity, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, diabetes, insulin resistance, inflammation, and various types of cancer, especially breast cancer. ",Białek A; Tokarz A,Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23475478/,1,0,0,0,0,0
23440843,Selenium supplementation for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.,"Selenium is a key component of a number of selenoproteins which protect against oxidative stress and have the potential to prevent chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, observational studies have shown inconsistent associations between selenium intake and CVD risk; in addition, there is concern around a possible increased risk of type 2 diabetes with high selenium exposure. To determine the effectiveness of selenium only supplementation for the primary prevention of CVD and examine the potential adverse effect of type 2 diabetes. The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 10 of 12, October 2012) on The Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 to week 2 October 2012); EMBASE Classic + EMBASE (Ovid) (1947 to 2012 Week 42); CINAHL (EBSCO) (to 24 October 2012); ISI Web of Science (1970 to 24 October 2012); PsycINFO (Ovid) (1806 to week 3 October 2012); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology Assessment Database and Health Economics Evaluations Database (Issue 4 of 4, October 2012) on The Cochrane Library. Trial registers and reference lists of reviews and articles were searched and experts in the field were approached. No language restrictions were applied. Randomised controlled trials on the effects of selenium only supplementation on major CVD end-points, mortality, changes in CVD risk factors, and type 2 diabetes were included both in adults of all ages from the general population and in those at high risk of CVD. Trials were only considered where the comparison group was placebo or no intervention. Only studies with at least three months follow-up were included in the meta-analyses, shorter term studies were dealt with descriptively. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Twelve trials (seven with duration of at least three months) met the inclusion criteria, with 19,715 participants randomised. The two largest trials that were conducted in the USA (SELECT and NPC) reported clinical events. There were no statistically significant effects of selenium supplementation on all cause mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.08), CVD mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.2), non-fatal CVD events (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.04) or all CVD events (fatal and non-fatal) (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11). There was a small increased risk of type 2 diabetes with selenium supplementation but this did not reach statistical significance (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.15). Other adverse effects that increased with selenium supplementation, as reported in the SELECT trial, included alopecia (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.62) and dermatitis grade 1 to 2 (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.35). Selenium supplementation reduced total cholesterol but this did not reach statistical significance (WMD - 0.11 mmol/L, 95% CI - 0.3 to 0.07). Mean high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels were unchanged. There was a statistically significant reduction in non-HDL cholesterol (WMD - 0.2 mmol/L, 95% CI - 0.41 to 0.00) in one trial of varying selenium dosage. None of the longer term trials examined effects on blood pressure. Overall, the included studies were regarded as at low risk of bias. The limited trial evidence that is available to date does not support the use of selenium supplements in the primary prevention of CVD.",Rees K; Hartley L; Day C; Flowers N; Clarke A; Stranges S,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23440843/,0,1,0,1,0,1
23434902,Selenistasis: epistatic effects of selenium on cardiovascular phenotype.,"Although selenium metabolism is intricately linked to cardiovascular biology and function, and deficiency of selenium is associated with cardiac pathology, utilization of selenium in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease remains an elusive goal. From a reductionist standpoint, the major function of selenium in vivo is antioxidant defense via its incorporation as selenocysteine into enzyme families such as glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductases. In addition, selenium compounds are heterogeneous and have complex metabolic fates resulting in effects that are not entirely dependent on selenoprotein expression. This complex biology of selenium in vivo may underlie the fact that beneficial effects of selenium supplementation demonstrated in preclinical studies using models of oxidant stress-induced cardiovascular dysfunction, such as ischemia-reperfusion injury and myocardial infarction, have not been consistently observed in clinical trials. In fact, recent studies have yielded data that suggest that unselective supplementation of selenium may, indeed, be harmful. Interesting biologic actions of selenium are its simultaneous effects on redox balance and methylation status, a combination that may influence gene expression. These combined actions may explain some of the biphasic effects seen with low and high doses of selenium, the potentially harmful effects seen in normal individuals, and the beneficial effects noted in preclinical studies of disease. Given the complexity of selenium biology, systems biology approaches may be necessary to reach the goal of optimization of selenium status to promote health and prevent disease.",Joseph J; Loscalzo J,Nutrients,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23434902/,1,0,0,0,0,0
23421468,Toward understanding success and failures in the use of selenium for cancer prevention.,"Adequate and supranutritional selenium (Se) intake, maintaining full expression of selenoproteins, has been assumed to be beneficial for human health with respect to prevention of cancer. Strikingly, the effectiveness of dietary Se supplementation depends on many factors: baseline Se status, age, gender, and genetic background of an individual; type of cancer; and time point of intervention in addition to metabolic conversion and dose of applied Se compounds. Se intake levels for optimization of plasma selenoproteins in humans have been delineated. Regulation, function, and genetic variants of several selenoproteins have been characterized in the intestine, where Se-mediated prevention of colorectal cancer appears to be particularly promising. Numerous cell culture and animal studies indicate anticarcinogenic capacity of various Se compounds but, at present, the outcome of human studies is inconsistent and, in large part, disappointing. Moreover, supranutritional Se intake may even trigger adverse health effects, possibly increasing the risk for Type 2 diabetes in Se-replete populations. To improve protocols for the use of Se in cancer prevention, knowledge on cellular and systemic actions of Se compounds needs to be broadened and linked to individual-related determinants such as the occurrence of variants in selenoprotein genes and the Se status. Based on better mechanistic insight, populations and individuals that may benefit most from dietary Se supplementation need to be defined and studied in suitably planned intervention trials.",Steinbrenner H; Speckmann B; Sies H,Antioxidants & redox signaling,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23421468/,1,0,0,0,0,0
23393691,Nutritional supplements and their effect on glucose control.,"As diabetes mellitus (DM) continues to be a growing health concern, many people have been turning to natural health products (NHPs) in order to manage this condition, adjunctive to, or even in place of conventional therapies. In order to keep up with this trend, research focussing on the efficacy and mechanisms behind the most common NHPs has been growing amongst the scientific community. The purpose of this chapter is to search and compile scientific literature focussing on the most commonly used NHPs in diabetes treatment, so to educate health professionals on the efficacy, safety and dosage of these products. From our findings, it is apparent that there are promising results from many studies on the potential benefit of NHPs in the treatment of diabetes. Nonetheless, many of the herbs and single nutraceuticals still require further studies in order to confirm safety, dosage and potential interactions with standard conventional therapies.

23385610,Zinc homeostasis in the metabolic syndrome and diabetes.,"Zinc (Zn) is an essential mineral that is required for various cellular functions. Zn dyshomeostasis always is related to certain disorders such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes and diabetic complications. The associations of Zn with metabolic syndrome, diabetes and diabetic complications, thus, stem from the multiple roles of Zn: (1) a constructive component of many important enzymes or proteins, (2) a requirement for insulin storage and secretion, (3) a direct or indirect antioxidant action, and (4) an insulin-like action. However, whether there is a clear cause-and-effect relationship of Zn with metabolic syndrome, diabetes, or diabetic complications remains unclear. In fact, it is known that Zn deficiency is a common phenomenon in diabetic patients. Chronic low intake of Zn was associated with the increased risk of diabetes and diabetes also impairs Zn metabolism. Theoretically Zn supplementation should prevent the metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and diabetic complications; however, limited available data are not always supportive of the above notion. Therefore, this review has tried to summarize these pieces of available information, possible mechanisms by which Zn prevents the metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and diabetic complications. In the final part, what are the current issues for Zn supplementation were also discussed.",Miao X; Sun W; Fu Y; Miao L; Cai L,Frontiers of medicine,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23385610/,1,0,0,0,0,0
23358371,[Selenium supplementation trials for cancer prevention and the subsequent risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus: selenium and vitamin E cancer prevention trial and after].,"The essential trace element selenium has long been considered to exhibit cancer-preventive, antidiabetic and insulin-mimetic properties. However, recent epidemiological studies have indicated that supranutritional selenium intake and high plasma selenium levels are not necessarily preventive against cancer, and are possible risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. The results of the SELECT, Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial, in which it is hypothesized that the supplementations with selenium and/or vitamin E decrease the prostate cancer incidence among healthy men in the U.S., showed that the supplementation did not prevent the development of prostate cancer and that the incidence of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus increased among the selenium-supplemented participants. The Nutritional Prevention of Cancer (NPC) trial showed a decreased risk of prostate cancer among participants taking 200 μg of selenium daily for 7.7 years. However, the results of the NPC trial also showed an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the participants with plasma selenium levels in the top tertile at the start of the study. Recently, the association of serum selenium with adipocytokines, such as TNF-α, VCAM-1, leptin, FABP-4, and MCP-1, has been observed. Selenoprotein P has been reported to associated with adiponectin, which suggests new roles of selenoprotein P in cellular energy metabolism, possibly leading to the increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and also the development of cancer. Further studies are required to elucidate the relationship between selenium and adipocytokines and the role of selenoprotein P in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cancer at high levels of selenium.",Koyama H; Abdulah R; Yamazaki C; Kameo S,Nihon eiseigaku zasshi.

23332888,Vanilloid receptors--do they have a role in whole body metabolism? Evidence from TRPV1.,"With increasing lifespan, therapeutic interventions for the treatment of disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus are in great demand. Despite billions of dollars invested to reduce the symptoms and complications due to diabetes mellitus, current treatments (e.g., insulin replacements, sensitization) remain inadequate, justifying the search for novel therapeutic approaches or alternative solutions, including dietary supplementation, for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in every age group. The involvement of the vanilloid system in the regulation of metabolism has been identified, and the emerging role of its receptors, the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1), in diabetes was recently demonstrated. Indeed, beneficial effects of dietary capsaicin, an agonist of TRPV1 receptors, were identified for improving glucose, insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 levels.

These lysine deacetylases have attracted much interest based on their ability to promote survival in response to stress. Sirtuins require NAD(+) for their enzymatic activity, suggesting that these enzymes may represent molecular links between cell metabolism and several human disorders, including diabetes and cancer. Inflammation represents a pathological situation with clear connections to metabolism and aging in humans, raising the possibility that sirtuins may also play an important role during a normal and/or a pathological immune response. A growing body of data has confirmed the immunomodulatory properties of sirtuins, although often with contrasting and opposing conclusions.

Therefore, achieving adequate iodine nutrition during pregnancy is an important public health objective. Although there have been tremendous gains over the last several decades in our understanding of the effects of iodine deficiency in pregnancy and how to combat them, a number of questions remain about how best to monitor the iodine status of pregnant populations, the effects of mild to moderate iodine deficiency on maternal and child outcomes, the safe upper limit of daily iodine intake in pregnant women and the risks and benefits of iodine supplementation for mildly iodine-deficient pregnant women.",Pearce EN,European journal of clinical nutrition,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23321572/,1,0,0,0,0,0
23313434,Let them eat during dialysis: an overlooked opportunity to improve outcomes in maintenance hemodialysis patients.,"In individuals with chronic kidney disease, surrogates of protein-energy wasting, including a relatively low serum albumin and fat or muscle wasting, are by far the strongest death risk factor compared with any other condition. There are data to indicate that hypoalbuminemia responds to nutritional interventions, which may save lives in the long run. Monitored, in-center provision of high-protein meals and/or oral nutritional supplements during hemodialysis is a feasible, inexpensive, and patient-friendly strategy despite concerns such as postprandial hypotension, aspiration risk, infection control and hygiene, dialysis staff burden, diabetes and phosphorus control, and financial constraints. Adjunct pharmacologic therapies can be added, including appetite stimulators (megesterol, ghrelin, and mirtazapine), anabolic hormones (testosterone and growth factors), antimyostatin agents, and antioxidative and anti-inflammatory agents (pentoxiphylline and cytokine modulators), to increase efficiency of intradialytic food and oral supplementation, although adequate evidence is still lacking. If more severe hypoalbuminemia (<3.0 g/dL) not amenable to oral interventions prevails, or if a patient is not capable of enteral interventions (e.g., because of swallowing problems), then parenteral interventions such as intradialytic parenteral nutrition can be considered. Given the fact that meals and supplements during hemodialysis would require only a small fraction of the funds currently used for dialysis patients this is also an economically feasible strategy.",Kalantar-Zadeh K; Ikizler TA,Journal of renal nutrition : the official journal of the Council on Renal Nutrition of the National Kidney Foundation,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23313434/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We conducted a meta-analysis of relevant randomized trials to further examine this issue. This meta-analysis included 8234 patients with kidney disease from nine qualified randomized trials using folic acid therapy, and with CVD reported as one of the endpoints. Relative risk (RR) was used to measure the effect of folic acid supplementation on risk of CVD using a random effects model. When pooling the nine randomized trials, folic acid therapy reduced the risk of CVD by 10%（RR = 0.90; 95% CI:0.81-1.00, P = 0.046). A greater beneficial effect was observed among those trials without a history of grain fortification with folic acid (0.82; 0.70-0.96, P = 0.01), with lower percent baseline diabetes (<30% (median), 0.80; 0.65-0.99, P = 0.04), and in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or advanced chronic kidney disease (ACKD) (0.85; 0.77-0.94, P = 0.002). Furthermore, a meta-regression analysis suggested a positive dose-response relationship between percent baseline diabetes and log-RR for CVD risk associated with folic acid supplementation (P = 0.007). Most importantly, even the inclusion of three subgroup results did not substantially affect the results (n = 11032, RR: 0.93; 95% CI:0.87-0.99, P = 0.03). Our meta-analysis indicates that folic acid supplementation may be effective for CVD prevention in patients with kidney disease, particularly in trials among patients without a history of grain fortification with folic acid, with lower percent baseline diabetes, and in patients with ESRD or ACKD.",Qin X; Huo Y; Xie D; Hou F; Xu X; Wang X,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23313356/,0,0,0,1,0,0

Vitamin D deficiency is now recognized as a global pandemic. The major cause for vitamin D deficiency is the lack of appreciation that sun exposure has been and continues to be the major source of vitamin D for children and adults of all ages. Vitamin D plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of a healthy skeleton throughout life.

23293044,Direct and indirect antioxidant properties of α-lipoic acid and therapeutic potential.,"Diabetes has emerged as a major threat to worldwide health. The exact mechanisms underlying the disease are unknown; however, there is growing evidence that the excess generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with hyperglycemia, causes oxidative stress in a variety of tissues. In this context, various natural compounds with pleiotropic actions like α-lipoic acid (LA) are of interest, especially in metabolic diseases such as diabetes. LA, either as a dietary supplement or a therapeutic agent, modulates redox potential because of its ability to match the redox status between different subcellular compartments as well as extracellularly. Both the oxidized (disulfide) and reduced (di-thiol: dihydro-lipoic acid, DHLA) forms of LA show antioxidant properties. LA exerts antioxidant effects in biological systems through ROS quenching but also via an action on transition metal chelation. Dietary supplementation with LA has been successfully employed in a variety of in vivo models of disease associated with an imbalance of redox status: diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The complex and intimate association between increased oxidative stress and increased inflammation in related disorders such as diabetes, makes it difficult to establish the temporal sequence of the relationship.",Rochette L; Ghibu S; Richard C; Zeller M; Cottin Y; Vergely C,Molecular nutrition & food research,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23293044/,1,0,0,0,0,0

23286442,"Zinc, pancreatic islet cell function and diabetes: new insights into an old story.","Zn is an essential trace element, involved in many different cellular processes. A relationship between Zn, pancreatic function and diabetes was suggested almost 70 years ago. To emphasise the importance of Zn in biology, the history of Zn research in the field of diabetes along with a general description of Zn transporter families will be reviewed. The paper will then focus on the effects of Zn on pancreatic β-cell function, including insulin synthesis and secretion, Zn signalling in the pancreatic islet, the redox functions of Zn and its target genes. The recent association of two 'Zn genes', i.e. metallothionein (MT) and Zn transporter 8 (SLC 30A8), with type 2 diabetes at the genetic level and with insulin secretion in clinical studies offers a potential new way to identify new drug targets to modulate Zn homeostasis directly in β-cells. The action of Zn for insulin action in its target organs, as Zn signalling in other pancreatic islet cells, will be addressed. Therapeutic Zn-insulin preparations and the influence of Zn and Zn transporters in type 1 diabetes will also be discussed. An extensive review of the literature on the clinical studies using Zn supplementation in the prevention and treatment of both types of diabetes, including complications of the disease, will evaluate the overall beneficial effects of Zn supplementation on blood glucose control, suggesting that Zn might be a candidate ion for diabetes prevention and therapy.

There is evidence that the link between diet and this kind of diseases is low grade chronic inflammation induced by some nutrients. Inflammation is a natural defense mechanism which helps to avoid tissue injuries caused by biological, physical and chemical factors. Adequate inflammatory process is defined by intensity and duration. As a chronic state (silent inflammation, low grade chronic inflammation), it became an etiologic factor of chronic diseases. References indicate that consumption of some nutrients ? such as fatty acids, glucose, bioactive plant compounds, some vitamins and minerals - is related with enhancement or alleviation of inflammatory state. Including them in diet could help to decrease the risk of chronic diseases and health complications caused by them. The aim of this paper is to show modulation properties of diet due to chronic inflammatory state and short characteristic of chosen components with attributed pro- or anti-inflammatory activity.

The etiology of stroke is often unknown; it has been estimated that the etiology and pathophysiology remains unexplained in more than 40% of stroke cases. The conventional stroke risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and cardiac diseases, do not fully account for the risk of stroke, and stroke victims, especially young subjects, often do not have any of these factors. It is very likely that inflammation, specific genetic predispositions and traditional risk factors interact with each other and may together increase the risk of stroke. Inflammatory and immune responses play important roles in the course of ischemic stroke. Hyperhomocysteinemia (hcy) is considered a modifiable risk factor for stroke, possibly through an atherogenic and prothrombotic mechanism. Both genetic and environmental factors (e.g., dietary intake of folic acid and B vitamins) affect homocysteine level. Identification of the role of hcy as a modifiable risk factor for stroke and of HSPs as regulators of the immune response may lead to more effective prevention and treatment of stroke through dietary and pharmacological intervention.

Vitamin D has been defined as natural immune modulators, and upon activation of its receptors (VDRs), it regulates calcium metabolism, cellular growth, proliferation and apoptosis, and other immunological functions. Epidemiological data underline a strong correlation between poor vitamin D status and higher risk for chronic inflammatory illnesses of various etiologies, including autoimmune diseases. Epidemiological, genetic, and basic studies indicated a potential role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis of certain systemic and organ-specific autoimmune diseases. These studies demonstrate correlation between low vitamin D and prevalence of diseases. In addition, VDRs' polymorphisms observed in some of these autoimmune diseases may further support a plausible pathogenic link. Notably, for some autoimmune disease, no correlation with vitamin D levels could be confirmed. Thus, in the current review we present the body of evidence regarding the plausible roles of vitamin D and VDR's polymorphism in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity. We summarize the data regarding systemic (i.e., systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.) and organ-specific (i.e., multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus, primary biliary cirrhosis, etc.) autoimmune diseases, in which low level of vitamin D was found comparing to healthy subjects. In addition, we discuss the correlations between vitamin D levels and clinical manifestations and/or activity of diseases. In this context, we address the rational for vitamin D supplementation in patients suffering from autoimmune diseases. Further studies addressing the mechanisms by which vitamin D affects autoimmunity and the proper supplementation required are needed.",Agmon-Levin N; Theodor E; Segal RM; Shoenfeld Y,Clinical reviews in allergy & immunology,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23238772/,1,0,0,0,0,0
23202286,Nutrition and benign prostatic hyperplasia.,"Nutrition seems to modify the pathogenesis of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) effect symptomology in men suffering from lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Although there are numerous pharmaceuticals and procedures for these conditions, nutrition may improve outcomes as a primary approach or in tandem with BPH medications or procedures. The purpose of this review is to highlight the benefits of nutrition and dietary supplements in men with BPH and LUTS. Dietary factors have an impact on metabolic disorders that lead to diabetes and obesity - both of which inversely effect BPH and LUTS. Dietary patterns associated with increased risks include starches and red meats, whereas moderate alcohol intake and polyunsaturated fat and vegetable consumption decrease risks. Dietary supplements of zinc, saw palmetto, and beta-sitosterol in relieving BPH symptoms have had mixed results. Randomized clinical trials of nutritional practices and other lifestyle alterations such as exercise for the prevention or treatment of BPH and LUTS have yet to be performed. Nutritional practices may provide for the prevention and treatment of BPH and LUTS while positively affecting other systemic parameters. Whereas there are a few clinical randomized trials for the prevention and treatment of BPH and LUTS, nutritional modifications may have a healthy lifestyle alternative with minimal to no adverse effects.",Espinosa G,Current opinion in urology,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23202286/,1,0,0,0,0,0

If uncorrected, and combined with aging effects, they will compromise muscle function and mass. Knowing causes can guide studies of preventive and treatment measures. T2DM accelerates age-related decreases in muscle mass. This could be related to insulin resistance of whole-body protein anabolism demonstrated in hyperglycemic obese men. In contrast, their protein anabolic response to hyperaminoacidemia suggested that ample amino acid administration, especially branched chain amino acids might overcome such insulin resistance. One study of chronic leucine supplementation in elderly T2DM patients did not increase muscle mass. However, they lacked sarcopenia and had adequate dietary protein intake, so may be atypical. Exercise induced similar increases in muscle protein synthesis, mass and strength in healthy and T2DM patients suggesting that physical activity might also overcome insulin resistance of protein anabolism. Muscle protein anabolism in T2DM is resistant to the action of insulin but perhaps not to amino acid supply or exercise. Whether leucine supplementation improves muscle mass and function in persons with T2DM (especially elderly) with reduced protein intake or muscle mass needs to be determined.",Bassil MS; Gougeon R,Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23196814/,1,0,0,0,0,0

23167714,Nutritional antioxidants and their applications in cardiometabolic diseases.,"There is an increasing global trend in cardiometabolic disorders being a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Adverse dietary habits and sedentary lifestyles contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes mellitus (DM). Dietary nutrients in nuts have attracted attention in recent literature due to their beneficial effects on CVD by attenuating lipid profiles, inflammation and oxidative stress. There is well-established evidence of the pharmacological properties of micronutrients that render them therapeutically effective in chronic inflammatory diseases. Although caution should be exercised in using antioxidant supplementation, antioxidant foods as dietary components play an important role in the management of cardiometabolic disorders. There is documented evidence of disease-modifying effects of nutritional compounds with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. They have specific applications in ameliorating oxidative stress- induced inflammatory diseases such as DM and CVD. It is relevant that dietary components that influence risk of DM, have similar effects on inflammatory biomarkers of cardiovascular risk. Polyphenolic compounds such as flavonoids, isoflavones, phenolic acids and lignan contribute to increased plasma antioxidant capacity, decreased oxidative stress markers and reduced total and LDL cholesterol. They modulate genes associated with metabolism, stress defence, detoxification and transporter proteins. Their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions have specific applications for pathologies associated with chronic low-grade systemic inflammation that underpins progression of DM and CVD. Mechanisms involved depend on the structure of the compound, redox status of the inflammatory milieu and other interactions. Bioactive phytochemicals play an important therapeutic role in attenuating oxidative damage induced by metabolic syndrome associated with atherogenic dyslipidaemia and a pro-inflammatory, pro-thrombotic state, at a sub-cellular level. It would be critical to formulate optimal proportions and their combinations for therapeutic efficacy, based on synergistic interactions.

23137858,Zinc and glycemic control: a meta-analysis of randomised placebo controlled supplementation trials in humans.,"Impaired zinc metabolism is prominent in chronic disorders including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Zinc has the potential to affect glucose homeostasis in animals and humans and hence impact the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised placebo controlled trials was conducted to determine the effect of zinc supplementation on fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, serum insulin and serum zinc concentrations. Relevant studies for inclusion were identified from a literature search of electronic databases up to July 2011. Fourteen reports (n=3978 subjects) were included in the meta-analysis. In the overall analysis, a small but statistically significant reduction in fasting glucose concentrations was observed (-0.19±0.08mmol/L, P=0.013) after zinc supplementation. HbA1c tended to decrease in zinc-supplemented individuals (-0.64±0.36%, P=0.072). No significant effect was observed for serum insulin concentrations. Plasma zinc concentrations increased significantly following supplementation (+4.03±0.81μmol/L, P=0.001). In secondary analyses of participants with chronic metabolic disease (types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome and obesity), zinc supplementation produced a greater reduction in glucose concentrations (-0.49±0.11mmol/L, P=0.001) compared to the effect that was observed in healthy participants. The significant albeit modest reduction in glucose concentrations and tendency for a decrease in HbA1c following zinc supplementation suggest that zinc may contribute to the management of hyperglycemia in individuals with chronic metabolic disease.",Capdor J; Foster M; Petocz P; Samman S,Journal of trace elements in medicine and biology : organ of the Society for Minerals and Trace Elements (GMS),2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23137858/,0,1,0,1,0,0
23131380,The effect of red yeast rice (Monascus purpureus) in dyslipidemia and other disorders.,"Red Yeast Rice (RYR) is a traditional Chinese food that is fermented and obtained after red yeast (Monascus purpureus) is grown on rice. RYR contains Monacolin K (Lovastatin) and other active ingredients that are thought to play a role in the management of cholesterol levels. Recently, many clinical trials have focused on the uses of RYR, including for dyslipidemia, coronary heart disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, cancer, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, fatigue, and memory. The primary objective of this review is to evaluate the effectiveness of RYR on the management of dyslipidemia. The secondary objective is to review studies that focus on the other uses of RYR. The following search terms were used: red yeast rice, Xuezhikang, Hypocol, Cholestin, Monascus purpureus combined with dyslipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, lipid, cardiovascular, coronary, atherosclerosis, diabetes, sugar, bone, osteoporosis, liver, fatigue, memory, Alzheimer's, dementia. Studies reviewed show that RYR significantly lowered LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol. Effects on triglycerides and HDL cholesterol were also observed in some studies. Compared with statins, RYR was shown to have an equal efficacy to statins when combined with or without other dietary supplements. RYR also appeared to be superior to placebo in preventing nonfatal myocardial infarction, total coronary heart disease events, and total deaths. On the other hand, information on diabetes, osteoporosis, cancer, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, fatigue, and memory are currently limited although in vivo and in vitro studies have shown an effect. Results of RYR clinical trials presented here have limitations and RYR's clinical use should be further investigated before using RYR as one of the alternative treatments for dyslipidemia management, despite the fact that the strongest evidence for RYR use is in dyslipidemia versus other clinical conditions.",Yang CW; Mousa SA,Complementary therapies in medicine,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23131380/,1,0,0,0,0,0
23131182,Vitamin D in the maternal-fetal-neonatal interface: clinical implications and requirements for supplementation.,"Identification of the current evidence regarding the pathophysiological and clinical facets of vitamin D in the maternal-fetal-neonatal interface is of value because of the significance of the vitamin D endocrine system in human health and high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in mothers and their infants. Although many questions have still not been answered by the existing literature, we found evidence that: (i) during pregnancy vitamin D participates in fetal skeletal mineralization and growth, (ii) neonatal vitamin D levels are dependent on the maternal vitamin D status at delivery, (iii) a vitamin D sufficient status at birth may decrease the risk for the development of asthma and type 1 diabetes mellitus in later life, (iv) recommendations for maintaining serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels ≥32 ng/mL to avoid secondary hyperparathyroidism in adults have not been applied to mothers and their infants, (v) American Academy of Pediatrics recommended supplementation of 400 IU of vitamin D per day is sufficient only for infants who are born with normal vitamin D levels and (vii) supplementation of lactating mothers with high doses of vitamin D (4000 IU/d) allows the achievement of optimal 25(OH)D concentrations (>32 ng/mL) in the maternal and infant serum without any risk of hypervitaminosis D in the mother. We believe that inconsistency in the recognition of sufficient levels of vitamin D in mothers and their infants affects the identification of adequate doses for vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy, lactation and infancy.",Marshall I; Mehta R; Petrova A,"The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23131182/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Epidermiological studies have also shown a link between vitamin D deficiency in children and a more severe course of illness with lower respiratory tract infection or Respiratory Syncitial Virus (RSV) bronchiolitis.

Less than 100 cases are reported in the literature. These patients provide an experiment by nature enabling us to understand the role of vitamin D, especially in light of the ongoing debate concerning normal vitamin D levels and the supplement dosage that should be recommended. This article summarizes the role of vitamin D in calcium absorption, rennin-angiotensin system (RAS), and cardiac state in HVDRR patients. The precise spectrum of vitamin D activities can now be better evaluated by critical analysis of mouse models with targeted deletion of the gene encoding the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Of special interest is the unraveling of the role of VDR in calcium absorption and cardiac status in VDR-knockout mice. The facts that VDR-knockout mice up-regulate intestinal calcium absorption and skeletal mineralization independently of the VDR during pregnancy and lactation point to the existence of VDR-independent mechanisms that are involved in calcium absorption. The observation that mice with genetic disruption of the 1α-hydroxylase gene or of the VDR gene have an overstimulated RAS and consequently develop high blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy raised concern about potential risks to the cardiovascular system in HVDRR patients. The current review summarizes the new understanding of the effects of vitamin D on calcium absorption, the RAS, and heart hypertrophy derived from studying HVDRR patients from infancy to their mid-30s.",Tiosano D; Gepstein V,"Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity",2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23128575/,1,0,0,0,0,0
23094916,Safety issues of vitamin D supplementation.,"Vitamin D deficiency is a re-emerging global health problem, which is primarily due to inadequate vitamin D synthesis in the skin. Supplement use is an effective measure to improve vitamin D status. However, some safety issues have to be considered, which are highlighted in this review article: The concept of vitamin D safety consists of two models, the safe tolerable upper intake level (UL) method, and the idea of adequate circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels. Oral vitamin D intakes up to 250 μg/d have not been associated with harm. Hypercalcemia, the hallmark of vitamin D intoxication, may only occur if circulating 25(OH)D levels are consistently above 375-500 nmol/l. However, some observational studies indicate that already circulating 25(OH)D levels > 125 nmol/l are related to an increased morbidity and mortality risk. Therefore, the Institute of Medicine has set the UL for adults at 100 μg/d, and the adequate circulating 25(OH)D level at 50 to 125 nmol/l. In clinical practice, oral vitamin D dosing has to consider that the increment in circulating 25(OH)D depends on baseline 25(OH)D levels and the person's body weight. It is reasonable to assess 25(OH)D before and 3-6 months after initiation of oral vitamin D administration and to adjust the dose, if necessary. In future, two issues have to be clarified: First, would it be more appropriate to define instead of a fixed UL a variable UL, based on the individual's body weight? Second, what are the underlying mechanisms, if any, for potentially harmful vitamin D effects at circulating 25(OH)D levels between 125 and 375 nmol/l.",Zittermann A; Prokop S; Gummert JF; Börgermann J,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23094916/,1,0,0,0,0,0
23075936,Optimize dietary intake of vitamin D: an epigenetic perspective.,"Vitamin D has received global attention because of its many health benefits. Although there is general agreement about the importance of vitamin D for bone health, there remains skepticism about the nonskeletal health benefits of vitamin D. This review will not only focus on the vitamin D deficiency pandemic and ways to treat and prevent vitamin D deficiency but will also explore the epigenetic mechanisms of vitamin D that could help explain many of the nonskeletal benefits of enhancing vitamin D status. The Institute of Medicine and the Endocrine Society have made new recommendations for vitamin D intake to prevent vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency is defined as a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level below 20 ng/ml and vitamin D insufficiency is defined as 21-29 ng/ml. Recent observations have suggested that vitamin D can influence epigenetics which may help explain the nonskeletal health benefits that have been reported for vitamin D. There is general agreement that vitamin D deficiency is a worldwide health problem. This is due in part to the lack of appreciation that sunlight is an important source of vitamin D. There is no downside to increasing vitamin D intake and recent observations suggesting that vitamin D influences epigenetics provide a new insight for the importance of vitamin D in utero in reducing risk of chronic diseases later in life.",Hossein-nezhad A; Holick MF,Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23075936/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The purpose of this review is to highlight an important role for L-arginine in regulating BAT growth and development, thereby reducing obesity in mammals. Dietary supplementation with L-arginine reduces white adipose tissue in genetically or diet-induced obese rats, obese pregnant sheep, and obese humans with type II diabetes. L-arginine treatment enhances BAT growth in both fetuses and postnatal animals. At molecular and cellular levels, L-arginine stimulates expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1 (the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis), nitric oxide synthase, heme oxygenase, and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase. At the whole body level, L-arginine increases blood flow to insulin-sensitive tissues, adipose tissue lipolysis, and the catabolism of glucose and fatty acids, but inhibits fatty acid synthesis and ameliorates oxidative stress, thereby improving metabolic profile. L-arginine increases mammalian BAT growth and development via mechanisms involving gene expression, nitric oxide signaling, and protein synthesis. This enhances the oxidation of energy substrates and, thus, reduces white fat accretion in the body. L-arginine holds great promise in preventing and treating obesity in humans.",Wu Z; Satterfield MC; Bazer FW; Wu G,Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23075933/,1,0,0,0,0,0
23046013,Selenium and the thyroid gland: more good news for clinicians.,"The thyroid is the organ with the highest selenium content per gram of tissue because it expresses specific selenoproteins. Since the discovery of myxoedematous cretinism and thyroid destruction following selenium repletion in iodine- and selenium-deficient children, data on links between thyroid metabolism and selenium have multiplied. Although very minor amounts of selenium appear sufficient for adequate activity of deiodinases, thus limiting the impact of its potential deficiency on synthesis of thyroid hormones, selenium status appears to have an impact on the development of thyroid pathologies. The value of selenium supplementation in autoimmune thyroid disorders has been emphasized. Most authors attribute the effect of supplementation on the immune system to the regulation of the production of reactive oxygen species and their metabolites. In patients with Hashimoto's disease and in pregnant women with anti-TPO antibodies, selenium supplementation decreases anti-thyroid antibody levels and improves the ultrasound structure of the thyroid gland. Although clinical applications still need to be defined for Hashimoto's disease, they are very interesting for pregnant women given that supplementation significantly decreases the percentage of postpartum thyroiditis and definitive hypothyroidism. In Graves' disease, selenium supplementation results in euthyroidism being achieved more rapidly and appears to have a beneficial effect on mild inflammatory orbitopathy. A risk of diabetes has been reported following long-term selenium supplementation, but few data are available on the side effects associated with such supplementation and further studies are required.",Drutel A; Archambeaud F; Caron P,Clinical endocrinology,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23046013/,1,0,0,0,0,0
23037977,Black tea: chemical analysis and stability.,"Tea is the most popular flavored and functional drink worldwide. The nutritional value of tea is mostly from the tea polyphenols that are reported to possess a broad spectrum of biological activities, including anti-oxidant properties, reduction of various cancers, inhibition of inflammation, and protective effects against diabetes, hyperlipidemia and obesity. Tea polyphenols include catechins and gallic acid in green and white teas, and theaflavins and thearubigins as well as other catechin polymers in black and oolong teas.

Global research in tea polyphenols has generated much in vitro and in vivo data rationally correlating tea polyphenols with their preventive and therapeutic properties in human diseases such as cancer, and metabolic and cardiovascular diseases etc. Based on these scientific findings, numerous tea products have been developed including flavored tea drinks, tea-based functional drinks, tea extracts and concentrates, and dietary supplements and food ingredients, demonstrating the broad applications of tea and its extracts, particularly in the field of functional food.",Li S; Lo CY; Pan MH; Lai CS; Ho CT,Food & function,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23037977/,1,0,0,0,0,0
23030412,Selenium and cardiovascular surgery: an overview.,"Selenium is an essential nutritional element to mammalians necessary for the active function of different oxidant enzymes, as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), thioredoxin reductases (TrxR), and iodothyronine deiodinases (IDD). The anti-oxidative effect of selenium is pivotal for the human physiology. Oxidative stress is associated with various diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus or cancer, and is also associated with the majority of surgical procedures. Particularly, the use of cardiopulmonary bypass for open cardiac surgery with aortic clamping is always related to oxidative stress due to ischemia and reperfusion. Whereas myocardial protection with different temperatures and cardioplegic solutions has become more efficient, reperfusion is often followed by the activation of an injurious oxidative cascade. The pathogenesis of ischemia/reperfusion injury depends on many factors, among them, reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are considered as initiators of the injury. ROS formed during oxidative stress can initiate lipid peroxidation, oxidize proteins to inactive states and cause DNA strand breaks. ROS production is physiologically controlled by free radical scavengers such as GPx and TrxR, and superoxide dismutase systems. GPx and TrxR are seleno-cysteine dependent enzymes, and their activity is known to be related to selenium availability. Furthermore, selenium has been reported to regulate gene expression of these selenoproteins as a cofactor and there is some evidence that selenium supplementation can attenuate the oxidative stress and decrease the complications after cardiac surgery. However, other clinical studies failed to demonstrate an association between selenium deficiency and cardiovascular outcomes. The aim of our review is to summarize the experimental and clinical evidence of preoperative selenium supplementation and therapy after cardiac surgery, focusing on the pathophysiology of oxidative stress and the clinical usage of selenium.",Guo F; Monsefi N; Moritz A; Beiras-Fernandez A,Current drug safety,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23030412/,1,0,0,0,0,0

22921424,The role of vitamin D in cardiovascular disease: from present evidence to future perspectives.,"Vitamin D and its metabolites have wide-spread physiological roles far beyond the well described effects in skeletal biology. Many physiological processes are directly or indirectly regulated by vitamin D and in consequence, vitamin D deficiency is implicated in numerous disease conditions. Summarizing previous assumptions on the optimal vitamin D levels in humans these data point towards calcidiol levels of approximately 30 ng/ml as being sufficient. The role of vitamin D deficiency in cardiovascular disease is a relatively novel field of interest. Well substantiated experimental data describe convincingly regulatory effects of vitamin D regarding various cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Activation of the vitamin D receptor suppresses e.g. the renin-angiotensin system. These experimental data are strongly supported by epidemiological and observational human data that link vitamin D deficiency to the incidence, degree and prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and disease conditions. In contrast to the in vivo data and to the homogenous non-interventional observations, we know much less about controlled prospectively evaluated supplementation of vitamin D as a potentially therapeutic agent on cardiovascular events. High quality, large, and randomized controlled trials aiming primarily on cardiovascular end-points are absent. Speculations about the vitamin D usage in prevention or therapy of cardiovascular disease need to take potential drawbacks of vitamin D overdosing into account: Vitamin D overdosing might induce hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and increases in fibroblast growth-factor 23.

Scientific evidence suggests that 25(OH)D serum levels should be over 75 nmol/L; otherwise, there is no beneficial effect of vitamin D on long-latency diseases. Current regulatory authority recommendations are insufficient to reach this level of adequacy.

Psyllium supplementation does improve glucose levels and insulin response, blood pressure, as well as lipid profile in both animals and humans, thereby reducing metabolic risk factors. Appetite has also been reported to decrease after the consumption of psyllium in most studies. Collectively, psyllium supplementation could be promoted to patients who present MS risk factors, such as hypercholesterolaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia and hyperglycaemia. It may also play a role in controlling body weight, body composition, appetite and hypertension, but further investigation is still required.",Pal S; Radavelli-Bagatini S,Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22863407/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22852057,Zinc and regulation of inflammatory cytokines: implications for cardiometabolic disease.,"In atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus, the concomitant presence of low-grade systemic inflammation and mild zinc deficiency highlights a role for zinc nutrition in the management of chronic disease. This review aims to evaluate the literature that reports on the interactions of zinc and cytokines. In humans, inflammatory cytokines have been shown both to up- and down-regulate the expression of specific cellular zinc transporters in response to an increased demand for zinc in inflammatory conditions. The acute phase response includes a rapid decline in the plasma zinc concentration as a result of the redistribution of zinc into cellular compartments. Zinc deficiency influences the generation of cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-α, and in response to zinc supplementation plasma cytokines exhibit a dose-dependent response. The mechanism of action may reflect the ability of zinc to either induce or inhibit the activation of NF-κB. Confounders in understanding the zinc-cytokine relationship on the basis of in vitro experimentation include methodological issues such as the cell type and the means of activating cells in culture. Impaired zinc homeostasis and chronic inflammation feature prominently in a number of cardiometabolic diseases. Given the high prevalence of zinc deficiency and chronic disease globally, the interplay of zinc and inflammation warrants further examination.",Foster M; Samman S,Nutrients,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22852057/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22845031,Viscous versus nonviscous soluble fiber supplements: mechanisms and evidence for fiber-specific health benefits.,"This review focuses on the health benefits of viscous versus nonviscous soluble fibers, why symptoms can occur with increased fiber consumption, and how to avoid symptoms to improve adherence with a high-fiber diet. Review of scientific literature as well as evidence-based guidelines and resources. While it is generally known that ""fiber is good for you,"" it is less well known that specific health benefits are associated with specific fiber characteristics. Many of the health benefits of fiber can be directly correlated with the viscosity of soluble fibers when hydrated (i.e., gel-forming). A reduction in viscosity of a given fiber will attenuate these health benefits, and a nonviscous fiber does not exhibit these health benefits. Increasing the viscosity of chyme with a viscous soluble fiber has been shown clinically to lower cholesterol for cardiovascular health, improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, normalize stool form in both constipation (softens hard stool) and diarrhea (firms loose/liquid stool), and improve the objective clinical measures of metabolic syndrome (glycemic control, lipoprotein profile, body mass index/weight loss, and blood pressure).",Chutkan R; Fahey G; Wright WL; McRorie J,Journal of the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22845031/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22820239,Pomegranate peel and fruit extracts: a review of potential anti-inflammatory and anti-infective effects.,"Punica granatum L. (Punicaceae) has been used for centuries in many cultures for the prevention and treatment of a wide number of health disorders such as inflammation, diabetes, diarrhea, dysentery, dental plaque and to combat intestinal infections and malarial parasites. This review aims at providing an up-to-date overview of the chemical constituents, traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicology of Punica granatum L. Moreover, the focus of this review is the possible exploitation of this species to treat different diseases and to suggest future investigations. An extensive and systematic review of the extant literature was carried out, and the data under various sections were identified by using a computerized bibliographic search via PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar. All abstracts and full-text articles were examined. The most relevant articles were selected for screening and inclusion in this review. A variety of pomegranate ethnomedical uses have been recorded. Additionally, over the last decade, there has been a dramatic increase of interest in pomegranate as a medicinal and nutritional product due to its n1ewly identified potential health effects, which include treatment and prevention of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. From the toxicological perspective, pomegranate fruit juice, extracts and preparations have been proven to be safe. The ethnopharmacological relevance of pomegranate is fully justified by the most recent findings indicating the fruit is a medicinal and nutritional agent useful for treating a wide range of human disorders and maladies. Further investigations are needed to fully understand the mode of action of the active constituents and to fully exploit pomegranate's preventive and therapeutic potential.",Ismail T; Sestili P; Akhtar S,Journal of ethnopharmacology,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22820239/,0,1,0,0,0,0

Excess iodine is generally well tolerated, but individuals with underlying thyroid disease or other risk factors may be susceptible to iodine-induced thyroid dysfunction following acute or chronic exposure. Sources of increased iodine exposure include the global public health efforts of iodine supplementation, the escalating use of iodinated contrast radiologic studies, amiodarone administration in vulnerable patients, excess seaweed consumption, and various miscellaneous sources. Iodine-induced thyroid dysfunction may be subclinical or overt. Recognition of the association between iodine excess and iodine-induced hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism is important in the differential diagnosis of patients who present without a known cause of thyroid dysfunction.",Leung AM; Braverman LE,"Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity",2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22820214/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22812658,Nutrition and the healthy heart with an exercise boost.,"In this era of potent medications and major cardiovascular (CV) procedures, the value of nutrition can be forgotten. A healthy diet is essential, regardless of CV risk. Caloric balance is inherent to a good diet. Despite patients who say they eat little, ideal weight can be maintained if calories are burned. Composition is another component of a healthy diet. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Mediterranean diets provide proof of CV benefit from their specific content. Metabolic syndrome (MS) is associated with poor diet and obesity. A healthy diet with good nutrition benefits the MS patient and associated conditions such as obesity and diabetes. Exercise, in conjunction with a healthy diet and good nutrition, helps maintain optimal weight and provides CV benefit such as decreased inflammation and increased vasodilatation. Whether vitamins or other nutritional supplements are important in a healthy diet is unproven. Nevertheless, the most promising data of added benefit to a healthy diet is with vitamin D. Some dietary supplements also have promise. Alcohol, in moderation, especially red wine, has nutritional and heart protective benefits. Antioxidants, endogenous or exogenous, have received increased interest and appear to play a favorable nutritional role.

22783875,L-cysteine supplementation as an adjuvant therapy for type-2 diabetes.,"Diabetes remains a major public health issue. According to the American Diabetes Association, 23.5 million, or 10.7% of people in the USA aged 20 years and older, have diabetes. Type-2 diabetes is treated both by controlling the diet and with oral hypoglycemic drugs. However, for many patients, achieving a tight control of glucose is difficult with current regimens. This chapter discusses a relatively low-cost dietary supplement that could be used as an adjuvant therapy for type-2 diabetes. A review of the literature indicates that cysteine-rich whey protein improves glucose metabolism in diabetic animals and type-2 diabetic patients. Similarly, in animal studies, improvement in glucose metabolism is observed after supplementation with L-cysteine, or molecules containing a cysteine moiety. This chapter discusses the biochemical mechanisms by which L-cysteine can upregulate the insulin-dependent signaling cascades of glucose metabolism. Further studies are needed to examine whether clinical interventions using L-cysteine as an adjuvant therapy indeed help to control glycemia and vascular inflammation in the diabetic patient population.",Jain SK,Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22783875/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22776787,Can supplementation with vitamin D reduce the risk or modify the course of autoimmune diseases? A systematic review of the literature.,"To evaluate whether vitamin D levels are related to the risk of developing autoimmune diseases and whether supplementation with vitamin D can modify the course of the diseases. We reviewed the most relevant papers published from January 1973 to October 2011, using Medline and EMBASE and the search terms ""vitamin D""; ""autoimmune disease""; ""autoimmunity""; ""rheumatoid arthritis""; ""systemic lupus erythematosus""; ""scleroderma""; ""systemic sclerosis""; ""type 1 diabetes""; ""multiple sclerosis""; and ""undifferentiated connective tissue disease"". We selected studies on the environmental, genetic and epidemiologic association of vitamin D with autoimmune diseases. Using the strategy described, we identified 1268 articles. 331 articles were eliminated on the basis of the title and another 703 on the basis of the abstract, since they were considered irrelevant for the purposes of the study. Full-text examination was performed on the remaining 234 studies, and a further 15 studies were excluded from the review, since the results had been confirmed or superseded by more recent research. Finally, a systematic review was conducted on 219 articles concerning cross-sectional data on: vitamin D levels and autoimmune diseases; interventional data on vitamin D supplementation in autoimmune diseases; prospective data linking vitamin D level or intake to autoimmune disease risk. Physiopathology studies confirm that hypovitaminosis D, in genetically predisposed subjects, can impair self tolerance by compromising the regulation of dendritic cells, of regulatory T-lymphocytes and of Th1 cells. Cross-sectional studies show that levels of vitamin D <30 ng/mL are present in a significant percentage, not only in patients with autoimmune disease, but also in healthy subjects (30-77%), and link profound deficiency (<10 ng/mL) with aggravation of symptomatology, while genetic studies associate polymorphism of vitamin D receptors to various autoimmune diseases. Among experimental studies on humans, only those on type-1 diabetes prove that the risks are significantly reduced in infants treated with vitamin D after the 7th month (OR 0.71, 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.84) and that a dose-response effect exists. Basic, genetic, and epidemiological studies indicate a potential role of vitamin D in the prevention of autoimmune diseases, but randomized and controlled trials are necessary to establish the clinical efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in ill or at-risk subjects.",Antico A; Tampoia M; Tozzoli R; Bizzaro N,Autoimmunity reviews,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22776787/,0,1,0,0,0,0
22770766,n-3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids in animal models with neuroinflammation.,"Neuroinflammation is present in the majority of acute and chronic neurological disorders. Excess or prolonged inflammation in the brain is thought to exacerbate neuronal damage and loss. Identifying modulators of neuroinflammation is an active area of study since it may lead to novel therapies. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) are anti-inflammatory in many non-neural tissues; their role in neuroinflammation is less studied. This review summarizes the relationship between n-3 PUFA and brain inflammation in animal models of brain injury and aging. Evidence by and large shows protective effects of n-3 PUFA in models of sickness behavior, stroke, aging, depression, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and cytokine- and irradiation-induced cognitive impairments. However, rigorous studies that test the direct effects of n-3 PUFA in neuroinflammation in vivo are lacking. Future research in this area is necessary to determine if, and if so which, n-3 PUFA directly target brain inflammatory pathways. n-3 PUFA bioactive metabolites may provide novel therapeutic targets for neurological disorders with a neuroinflammatory component.",Orr SK; Trépanier MO; Bazinet RP,"Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids",2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22770766/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22727498,Effect of folic acid supplementation on plasma total homocysteine levels and glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The evidences illustrating the effects of folic acid supplementation (FAS) in individuals with type 2 diabetes on plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) levels and glycemic control have been contradictory. The aim of the study was to systematically search and quantitatively analyze the effect of FAS on tHcy levels and HbA1c compared with placebo. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Embase up to March 2012 without language restriction. Key words ""folic acid"" and ""diabetes mellitus"" with slight modifications based on the sources for search strategy were used. References of initially identified articles were examined to identify any other relevant studies. A random-effects model was used for estimation the pooled effect estimates (weighted mean different, WMD). Of 6185 studies identified, 4 studies with 183 patients were included. FAS had statistically significant effect on tHcy levels [WMD, -3.52; 95% confidence interval (CI), -4.44 to -2.60]. However, the effect on HbA1c levels [WMD, -0.37; 95% CI, -1.10 to 0.35] was not significant. Folic acid supplementation in patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus may reduce tHcy levels and have a trend to associate with better glycemic control compared with placebo. Further longitudinal studies on these intervention and outcomes are warranted.",Sudchada P; Saokaew S; Sridetch S; Incampa S; Jaiyen S; Khaithong W,Diabetes research and clinical practice,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22727498/,0,1,0,1,0,1
22672102,Dietary counselling with or without oral nutritional supplements in the management of malnourished patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.,"Dietary counselling and oral nutritional supplements (ONS) are recommended for managing malnutrition. A recent systematic review demonstrated (in separate analyses) that dietary counselling and dietary counselling with ONS improved energy intake, weight and some indices of body composition, although there was considerable heterogeneity. The present analysis aimed to examine the effects on mortality and nutritional indices of dietary counselling given with or without ONS and to explore the heterogeneity in the meta-analyses aiming to characterise the groups most likely to benefit from these interventions. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed using Cochrane methodology. Twenty-six studies were included in the analysis: 12 comparing dietary counselling with usual care and 14 comparing dietary counselling and ONS if required with usual care (2123 participants). Quality of studies varied. Dietary counselling given with or without ONS had no effect on mortality [relative risk (fixed) = 1.12; 95% confidence interval = 0.86-1.46] but was associated with significant but heterogeneous benefits to weight [mean difference (random) = 1.7 kg; 95% confidence interval = 0.86-2.55], energy intake and some aspects of body composition. Subgroup analyses taking into account clinical background, age, nutritional status, type and length of intervention failed to reveal any differences in mortality, weight change and energy intake between groups. There were insufficient data on functional outcomes to explore these findings. Dietary counselling given with or without ONS is effective at increasing nutritional intake and weight but adequately-powered studies in similar patient populations and standardised for factors that might account for variations in response are required.",Baldwin C; Weekes CE,Journal of human nutrition and dietetics : the official journal of the British Dietetic Association,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22672102/,0,1,0,1,0,0
22652774,Regulatory roles for L-arginine in reducing white adipose tissue.,"As the nitrogenous precursor of nitric oxide, L-arginine regulates multiple metabolic pathways involved in the metabolism of fatty acids, glucose, amino acids, and proteins through cell signaling and gene expression. Specifically, arginine stimulates lipolysis and the expression of key genes responsible for activation of fatty acid oxidation to CO2 and water. The underlying mechanisms involve increases in the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha), mitochondrial biogenesis, and the growth of brown adipose tissue growth. Furthermore, arginine regulates adipocyte-muscle crosstalk and energy partitioning via the secretion of cytokines and hormones. In addition, arginine enhances AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) expression and activity, thereby modulating lipid metabolism and energy balance toward the loss of triacylglycerols. Growing evidence shows that dietary supplementation with arginine effectively reduces white adipose tissue in Zucker diabetic fatty rats, diet-induced obese rats, growing-finishing pigs, and obese patients with type II diabetes. Thus, arginine can be used to prevent and treat adiposity and the associated metabolic syndrome.",Tan B; Li X; Yin Y; Wu Z; Liu C; Tekwe CD; Wu G,Frontiers in bioscience (Landmark edition),2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22652774/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22609892,Calcium and bone.,Evaluate the role of calcium on bone health. Review of literatures on calcium and bone development during childhood and bone health in adulthood and older age. Calcium intake influences skeletal calcium retention during growth and thus affects peak bone mass achieved in early adulthood. Increased calcium intake is associated with increased bone mineral accretion rate up to a threshold level in all ethnic groups. The minimum intake to achieve maximal retention is 1140 mg/day for white boys and 1300 mg/day for white girls. Calcium also plays a role in preventing bone loss and osteoporotic fractures in later life. Meta-analyses report that calcium supplementation reduce bone loss by 0.5-1.2% and the risk of fracture of all types by at least 10% in older people. Low calcium intake is a widespread problem across countries and age groups. Adequate calcium intake throughout lifetime is important for bone health and the prevention of osteoporosis and related fractures.,Zhu K; Prince RL,Clinical biochemistry,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22609892/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22607646,Evidence for using alpha-lipoic acid in reducing lipoprotein and inflammatory related atherosclerotic risk.,"Alpha lipoic acid (α-LA) is a potent biological antioxidant that is found naturally in the human body at very low concentrations, primarily in the mitochondria. However, synthetic α-LA is commercially available as a nutritional supplement and has been shown to be effective at ameliorating symptoms in diseases with an underlying oxidative stress component. High blood cholesterol is a major cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor and is responsive to diet and lifestyle modifications. In addition to high blood cholesterol, there is increasing evidence that supports the independent role of oxidized lipids and lipoproteins, chiefly oxidized low-density lipoproteins (Ox-LDL), in the development of CVD. Lowering total blood cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides (TG) and raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels is the most desirable metabolic state for maximum protection against CVD, but can be difficult to achieve through diet and exercise alone. With emerging evidence of reduced LDL-C and TG, increased HDL-C, and blunting of oxidative susceptibility of lipoproteins by α-LA, its use alone or in combination with other dietary supplements may be an effective strategy to modulate multiple metabolic targets of oxidative stress and cholesterol metabolism to reduce CVD risk. This review examines the current evidence for the use of α-LA in CVD risk reduction and identifies the remaining gaps that must be addressed in this area of research.",Harding SV; Rideout TC; Jones PJ,Journal of dietary supplements,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22607646/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22596255,The nonskeletal effects of vitamin D: an Endocrine Society scientific statement.,"Significant controversy has emerged over the last decade concerning the effects of vitamin D on skeletal and nonskeletal tissues. The demonstration that the vitamin D receptor is expressed in virtually all cells of the body and the growing body of observational data supporting a relationship of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D to chronic metabolic, cardiovascular, and neoplastic diseases have led to widespread utilization of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention and treatment of numerous disorders. In this paper, we review both the basic and clinical aspects of vitamin D in relation to nonskeletal organ systems. We begin by focusing on the molecular aspects of vitamin D, primarily by examining the structure and function of the vitamin D receptor. This is followed by a systematic review according to tissue type of the inherent biological plausibility, the strength of the observational data, and the levels of evidence that support or refute an association between vitamin D levels or supplementation and maternal/child health as well as various disease states. Although observational studies support a strong case for an association between vitamin D and musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, neoplastic, and metabolic disorders, there remains a paucity of large-scale and long-term randomized clinical trials. Thus, at this time, more studies are needed to definitively conclude that vitamin D can offer preventive and therapeutic benefits across a wide range of physiological states and chronic nonskeletal disorders.",Rosen CJ; Adams JS; Bikle DD; Black DM; Demay MB; Manson JE; Murad MH; Kovacs CS,Endocrine reviews,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22596255/,0,1,0,0,0,0

Vitamin D prophylaxis during the first years of life has empirically shown to be effective in combating rickets in infants in some countries. Vitamin D insufficiency can have negative effects on bone health in older children and in adolescents. Vitamin D supplementation has been shown to have an effect on bone mineral density at least in vitamin D deprived older children and adolescents but not in those with a normal vitamin D status. A good vitamin D status during pregnancy seems to be important for bone health in the off-spring later in life, but randomized controlled studies are needed to establish an effect of vitamin D during pregnancy on bone and other health outcomes in the offspring.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a complex disease affecting patients' daily life and elevating patients' risk of developing other diseases. There are several forms of diabetes, including type-1 diabetes (insulin-dependent), type-2 diabetes (noninsulin-dependent), and gestational diabetes. Type-2 diabetes is the most common form and the patient population with type-2 DM rises every year. Current treatments meet some but not all patients' needs. Therefore, new anti-diabetic drugs are in great demand. Traditional herbal medicine provides a rich source for new drug discovery. In this review, recent discoveries of anti-diabetic compounds have been summarized according to their chemical structures and mechanisms of action. Anti-diabetic plant extracts, many of which have been used and marketed as dietary supplements, were also included and discussed, and are classified according to the positive control used in the anti-diabetic animal studies.

Systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials comparing vitamin D or analogues with placebo. We extracted data on fasting glucose, glycaemic control, insulin resistance, insulin/C-peptide levels, micro- and macrovascular outcomes and progression from non-diabetes to diabetes. Studies were assessed independently by two reviewers according to a pre-specified protocol. Fifteen trials were included in the systematic review. Trial reporting was of moderate, variable quality. Combining all studies, no significant improvement was seen in fasting glucose, HbA(1c) or insulin resistance in those treated with vitamin D compared with placebo. For patients with diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, meta-analysis showed a small effect on fasting glucose (-0.32 mmol/l, 95%CI -0.57 to -0.07) and a small improvement in insulin resistance (standard mean difference -0.25, 95%CI -0.48 to -0.03). No effect was seen on glycated haemoglobin in patients with diabetes and no differences were seen for any outcome in patients with normal fasting glucose. Insufficient data were available to draw conclusions regarding micro- or macrovascular events; two trials failed to show a reduction in new cases of diabetes in patients treated with vitamin D. There is currently insufficient evidence of beneficial effect to recommend vitamin D supplementation as a means of improving glycaemia or insulin resistance in patients with diabetes, normal fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance.",George PS; Pearson ER; Witham MD,Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22486204/,0,1,0,1,0,0
22483092,The role of vitamin D in pregnancy and lactation: insights from animal models and clinical studies.,"Maternal adaptations during pregnancy and lactation appear to provide calcium to fetus and neonate without relying on vitamin D or calcitriol. Consequently, the blood calcium, calciotropic hormones, and skeleton appear normal at birth in the offspring of mothers who are severely vitamin D deficient or who lack calcitriol or its receptor. It remains unclear whether skeletal or extraskeletal problems will develop postnatally from exposure to vitamin D deficiency in utero. During the neonatal period, calcitriol-stimulated intestinal calcium absorption becomes the dominant mechanism of calcium delivery. The vitamin D-deficient neonate is at risk to develop hypocalcemia, rickets, and possibly extraskeletal disorders (e.g., type 1 diabetes). Breastfed babies are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency because normally little vitamin D or 25-hydroxyvitamin D passes into breast milk. Dosing recommendations during pregnancy and lactation should ensure that the baby is born vitamin D sufficient and maintained that way during infancy and beyond.",Kovacs CS,Annual review of nutrition,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22483092/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22460261,Fructo-oligosaccharide effects on blood glucose: an overview.,"To identify the current status of scientific knowledge in fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), non-conventional sugars that play an important role in glycemia control. We performed a search for scientific articles in MEDLINE and LILACS databases, from January 1962 to December 2011, using English/Portuguese key words: ""blood glucose/glicemia"", ""prebiotics/prebióticos"" and ""dietary fiber/fibras na dieta"". From an initial number of 434 references, some repeated, 43 references published from 1962 to 2011 were included in this study. The selected texts were distributed in three topics: (1) metabolism of FOS, (2) FOS and experimental studies involving glucose and (3) human studies involving glucose and FOS. Five studies have shown that the use of FOS reduces the fecal content and increases intestinal transit time. Experimental studies have shown that dietary supplementation with high doses (60 g/Kg) of propionate, a short-chain fatty acid decreased glycemia. The use of lower doses (3 g/kg) did not produce the same results. Study in subjects with diabetes type II showed that the addition of 8 grams of FOS in the diet for 14 days, caused a reduction in serum glucose. In another study with healthy subjects, there were no changes in glycemic control. This review demonstrates that consumption of FOS has a beneficial influence on glucose metabolism. The controversies appear to be due to inadequate methodological designs and/or the small number of individuals included in some studies.",Costa GT; Guimarães SB; Sampaio HA,Acta cirurgica brasileira,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22460261/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22459005,Lipid lowering with dietary supplements: focus on diabetes.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the predominant cause of mortality in type 2 diabetic (T2DM) patients. Dyslipidemia is a modifiable risk factor that should be treated early for CVD prevention. Further, dietary supplement intake is increasing in popularity worldwide. This review examines the recent meta-analyses and clinical studies on dietary supplements, specifically psyllium, garlic and green tea, on plasma lipids levels and glycemic control, as well as other potential CVD risk factors in T2DM patients. Generally, results demonstrate that psyllium supplements improve lipid profiles as well as glycemic control beyond a traditional diet in patients with T2DM. On the other hand, the results on the usefulness of garlic and green tea supplementation for dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia are uncertain. Overall, the addition of dietary supplements may be a therapeutic alternative to lower CVD risk factors in T2DM; however, more well-designed intervention studies are needed to assess the benefit of these dietary supplements.",Rudkowska I,Maturitas,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22459005/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22450858,Illicit use of androgens and other hormones: recent advances.,"To summarize recent advances in studies of illicit use of androgens and other hormones. Androgens and other appearance-enhancing and performance-enhancing substances are widely abused worldwide. Three notable clusters of findings have emerged in this field in recent years. First, studies almost unanimously find that androgen users engage in polypharmacy, often ingesting other hormones (e.g., human growth hormone, thyroid hormones, and insulin), ergo/thermogenic drugs (e.g., caffeine, ephedrine, and clenbuterol), and classical drugs of abuse (e.g., cannabis, opiates, and cocaine). Second, reports of long-term psychiatric and medical adverse effects of androgens continue to accumulate. In cardiovascular research particularly, controlled studies have begun to supersede anecdotal evidence, strengthening the case that androgens (possibly acting synergistically with other abused drugs) may cause significant morbidity and even mortality. Third, it is increasingly recognized that androgen use may lead to a dependence syndrome with both psychological and physiological origins.

22423897,Molecular mechanisms of chromium in alleviating insulin resistance.,"Type 2 diabetes is often associated with obesity, dyslipidemia and cardiovascular anomalies and is a major health problem approaching global epidemic proportions. Insulin resistance, a prediabetic condition, precedes the onset of frank type 2 diabetes and offers potential avenues for early intervention to treat the disease. Although lifestyle modifications and exercise can reduce the incidence of diabetes, compliance has proved to be difficult, warranting pharmacological interventions. However, most of the currently available drugs that improve insulin sensitivity have adverse effects. Therefore, attractive strategies to alleviate insulin resistance include dietary supplements. One such supplement is chromium, which has been shown to reduce insulin resistance in some, but not all, studies. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms of chromium in alleviating insulin resistance remain elusive. This review examines emerging reports on the effect of chromium, as well as molecular and cellular mechanisms by which chromium may provide beneficial effects in alleviating insulin resistance.",Hua Y; Clark S; Ren J; Sreejayan N,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22423897/,1,0,0,0,0,0

22366772,A critical review of vitamin C for the prevention of age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease.,"Antioxidants in the diet have long been thought to confer some level of protection against the oxidative damage that is involved in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease as well as general cognitive decline in normal aging. Nevertheless, support for this hypothesis in the literature is equivocal. In the case of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) in particular, lack of consideration of some of the specific features of vitamin C metabolism has led to studies in which classification of participants according to vitamin C status is inaccurate, and the absence of critical information precludes the drawing of appropriate conclusions. Vitamin C levels in plasma are not always reported, and estimated daily intake from food diaries may not be accurate or reflect actual plasma values. The ability to transport ingested vitamin C from the intestines into blood is limited by the saturable sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter (SVCT1) and thus very high intakes and the use of supplements are often erroneously considered to be of greater benefit that they really are. The current review documents differences among the studies in terms of vitamin C status of participants. Overall, there is a large body of evidence that maintaining healthy vitamin C levels can have a protective function against age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease, but avoiding vitamin C deficiency is likely to be more beneficial than taking supplements on top of a normal, healthy diet.",Harrison FE,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22366772/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22364157,Suboptimal magnesium status in the United States: are the health consequences underestimated?,"In comparison with calcium, magnesium is an ""orphan nutrient"" that has been studied considerably less heavily. Low magnesium intakes and blood levels have been associated with type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, elevated C-reactive protein, hypertension, atherosclerotic vascular disease, sudden cardiac death, osteoporosis, migraine headache, asthma, and colon cancer. Almost half (48%) of the US population consumed less than the required amount of magnesium from food in 2005-2006, and the figure was down from 56% in 2001-2002. Surveys conducted over 30 years indicate rising calcium-to-magnesium food-intake ratios among adults and the elderly in the United States, excluding intake from supplements, which favor calcium over magnesium. The prevalence and incidence of type 2 diabetes in the United States increased sharply between 1994 and 2001 as the ratio of calcium-to-magnesium intake from food rose from <3.0 to >3.0. Dietary Reference Intakes determined by balance studies may be misleading if subjects have chronic latent magnesium deficiency but are assumed to be healthy. Cellular magnesium deficit, perhaps involving TRPM6/7 channels, elicits calcium-activated inflammatory cascades independent of injury or pathogens. Refining the magnesium requirements and understanding how low magnesium status and rising calcium-to-magnesium ratios influence the incidence of type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, and other inflammation-related disorders are research priorities.",Rosanoff A; Weaver CM; Rude RK,Nutrition reviews,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22364157/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22362099,Preventive and improvement effects of exercise training and supplement intake in white adipose tissues on obesity and lifestyle-related diseases.,"Recent increases in the number of obese individuals and individuals suffering from lifestyle-related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, that accompany obesity have become a serious social problem. White adipose tissue (WAT) is more than a mere organ for storage of energy; it is also a highly active metabolic and endocrine organ that secretes physiologically active substances collectively known as adipokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α and adiponectin. Dysregulated expression of adipokines in WAT that is hypertrophied by obesity has been closely associated with the phenomenon of insulin resistance. Therefore, WAT is currently considered to be one of the tissues that promote lifestyle-related diseases. Reduction of excess WAT that results from obesity is seen as an important strategy in preventing and improving lifestyle-related diseases. This review shows that exercise training as well as intake of supplements, such as polyphenols, is one strategy for this, because this regimen can result in reduction of WAT mass, which affects the expression and secretory response of adipokines.",Sakurai T; Ogasawara J; Kizaki T; Ishibashi Y; Sumitani Y; Takahashi K; Ishida H; Miyazaki H; Saitoh D; Haga S; Izawa T; Ohno H,Environmental health and preventive medicine,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22362099/,1,0,0,0,0,0

In this study we systematically report on clinical studies evaluating the impact of vitamin D on aspects of hyperglycaemia in non-pregnant adults. A total of 1,294 articles, of which 417 were reviews, were identified. No well-designed randomised, controlled trials were identified that specifically investigated the effects of vitamin D supplementation on glucose and insulin concentrations. The majority of the studies that are available were poorly designed, having limited numbers, short study duration, or were conducted in volunteers with normal baseline, as measured by 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), concentrations or used inadequate doses of the supplements to normalise vitamin D concentrations, or used inappropriate analyses. Most studies did not observe improvements in glycaemia, with few exceptions. The results were more equivocal for aspects of insulin resistance. Most found no benefit on measures of insulin resistance, although some did. However, more studies described improved insulin release, although data from the studies to date are really inadequate to provide any reliable conclusions. Well-conducted randomised, controlled trials with adequate vitamin D doses are required to effectively assess whether this vitamin can reduce the incidence of diabetes.",Thomas GN; Scragg R; Jiang CQ; Chan W; Marz W; Pilz S; Kim HC; Tomlinson B; Bosch J; Lam TH; Cheung BM; Cheng KK,Current diabetes reviews,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22352447/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22329631,A review of the hypoglycemic effects of five commonly used herbal food supplements.,"Hyperglycemia is a pathological condition associated with prediabetes and diabetes. The incidence of prediabetes and diabetes is increasing and imposes great burden on healthcare worldwide. Patients with prediabetes and diabetes have significantly increased risk for cardiovascular diseases and other complications. Currently, management of hyperglycemia includes pharmacological interventions, physical exercise, and change of life style and diet. Food supplements have increasingly become attractive alternatives to prevent or treat hyperglycemia, especially for subjects with mild hyperglycemia. This review summarized current patents and patent applications with relevant literature on five commonly used food supplements with claims of hypoglycemic effects, including emblica officinalis (gooseberry), fenugreek, green tea, momordica charantia (bitter melon) and cinnamon. The data from human clinical studies did not support a recommendation for all five supplements to manage hyperglycemia. Fenugreek and composite supplements containing emblica officinalis showed the most consistency in lowering fasting blood sugar (FBS) or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in diabetic patients. The hypoglycemic effects of cinnamon and momordica charantia were demonstrated in most of the trials with some exceptions. However, green tea exhibited limited benefits in reducing FBS or HbA1c levels and should not be recommended for managing hyperglycemia. Certain limitations are noticed in a considerable number of clinical studies including small sample size, poor experimental design and considerable variations in participant population, preparation format, daily dose, and treatment duration. Future studies with more defined participants, standardized preparation and dose, and improved trial design and size are warranted.",Deng R,"Recent patents on food, nutrition & agriculture",2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22329631/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22328068,Vitamin D and vascular disease: the current and future status of vitamin D therapy in hypertension and kidney disease.,"Over the past decade, vitamin D has generated considerable interest as potentially having important effects on the vasculature and the kidney. Animal and human data indicate that vitamin D suppresses the activity of the renin-angiotensin system and improves endothelial function. Observational studies in humans suggest that low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels are associated with a higher risk of hypertension. However, findings from randomized trials of vitamin D supplementation (with cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) to lower blood pressure are inconsistent, possibly stemming from variability in study population, sample size, vitamin D dose, and duration. Supplementation with activated vitamin D (i.e., 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D or analogues) in patients with chronic kidney disease reduces urine albumin excretion, an important biomarker for future decline in renal function. These studies are reviewed, with special emphasis on recent findings. Definitive studies are warranted to elucidate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on mechanisms of hypertension and kidney disease.",Vaidya A; Forman JP,Current hypertension reports,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22328068/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22327734,Vitamin D in pregnancy: current concepts.,"Vitamin D is part of a complex steroid hormone system long known to be involved in bone metabolism. Recently, vitamin D has been implicated in physiologic processes as diverse as vascular health, immune function, metabolism and placental function. This review summarizes the current evidence for the role of vitamin D in pregnancy and perinatal outcomes A systematic review of articles published in PubMed between May 2010 and October 2011 was undertaken using key words for vitamin D and pregnancy. Seventy-eight studies were reviewed. The biologic evidence regarding a role for vitamin D in reproductive outcomes is strong, and rates of vitamin D deficiency may be high among pregnant women. However, no consensus exists regarding optimum vitamin D levels in pregnancy or standard measurement of vitamin D deficiency. Clinical studies establishing an association between vitamin D levels and adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, low birthweight, preterm labor, cesarean delivery and infectious diseases have conflicting results. This is likely due to a paucity of randomized trials, heterogeneity of populations studied and low sample size with poor adjustment for confounding among observational studies. Further research should focus on defining optimum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels in pregnancy as well as among various subgroups of the population. Randomized trials are needed to determine whether vitamin D supplementation can improve pregnancy outcomes. Currently, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the Institute of Medicine recommend 600 IU of daily vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy to support maternal and fetal bone metabolism.",Urrutia RP; Thorp JM,Current opinion in obstetrics & gynecology,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22327734/,0,1,0,0,0,0
22296934,Human health effects of conjugated linoleic acid from milk and supplements.,"The primary purpose of the present review was to determine if the scientific evidence available for potential human health benefits of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is sufficient to support health claims on foods based on milk naturally enriched with cis-9, trans-11-CLA (c9, t11-CLA). A search of the scientific literature was conducted and showed that almost all the promising research results that have emerged in relation to cancer, heart health, obesity, diabetes and bone health have been in animal models or in vitro. Most human intervention studies have utilised synthetic CLA supplements, usually a 50:50 blend of c9, t11-CLA and trans-10, cis-12-CLA (t10, c12-CLA). Of these studies, the only evidence that is broadly consistent is an effect on body fat and weight reduction. A previous review of the relevant studies found that 3.2 g CLA/d resulted in a modest body fat loss in human subjects of about 0.09 kg/week, but this effect was attributed to the t10, c12-CLA isomer. There is no evidence of a consistent benefit of c9, t11-CLA on any health conditions; and in fact both synthetic isomers, particularly t10, c12-CLA, have been suspected of having pro-diabetic effects in individuals who are already at risk of developing diabetes. Four published intervention studies using naturally enriched CLA products were identified; however, the results were inconclusive. This may be partly due to the differences in the concentration of CLA administered in animal and human studies. In conclusion, further substantiation of the scientific evidence relating to CLA and human health benefits are required before health claims can be confirmed.",McCrorie TA; Keaveney EM; Wallace JM; Binns N; Livingstone MB,Nutrition research reviews,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22296934/,1,0,0,0,0,0

22279133,Stearidonic acid: is there a role in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes mellitus?,"Obesity and its related comorbidities are major public health concerns in the United States with over two-thirds of adults and one-third of children classified as overweight or obese. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has similarly risen to an estimated 25.8 million, which accounts for a staggering $174 billion in annual healthcare costs. Identification of dietary interventions that protect against the development of T2DM would markedly reduce the medical and economic consequences of the disease. Hence, we review current evidence supporting a role of (n-3) PUFA in T2DM and explore potential therapeutic implications of stearidonic acid (SDA). The low consumption of fish in the US along with a reduced efficiency to interconvert most plant (n-3) PUFA highlights a need to find alternative sources of (n-3) PUFA. The efficient biological conversion of SDA to EPA underscores the potential implications of SDA as a source of (n-3) PUFA. The full therapeutic efficacy of SDA remains to be further determined. However, recent data have suggested a protective role of SDA consumption on markers of dyslipidemia and inflammation. The AHA recommends that healthy individuals consume oily fish at least twice per week and individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease consume 1 g of EPA+DHA/d. These goals will likely not be met by the typical American diet. Therefore, SDA may represent a sustainable alternative to marine-based (n-3) PUFA and may have novel therapeutic efficacy regarding the development of T2DM.",Banz WJ; Davis JE; Clough RW; Cheatwood JL,The Journal of nutrition,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22279133/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22265795,Can vitamin D deficiency cause diabetes and cardiovascular diseases? Present evidence and future perspectives.,"Several studies have shown that vitamin D may play a role in many biochemical mechanisms in addition to bone and calcium metabolism. Recently, vitamin D has sparked widespread interest because of its involvement in the homeostasis of the cardiovascular system. Hypovitaminosis D has been associated with obesity, related to trapping in adipose tissue due to its lipophilic structure. In addition, vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and this may be due to the relationship between low vitamin D levels and obesity, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. However, although vitamin D has been identified as a potentially important marker of CVD, the mechanisms through which it might modulate cardiovascular risk are not fully understood. Given this background, in this work we summarise clinical retrospective and prospective observational studies linking vitamin D levels with cardio-metabolic risk factors and vascular outcome. Moreover, we review various randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of vitamin D supplementation on surrogate markers of cardiovascular risk. Considering the high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D among patients with high cardiovascular risk, vitamin D replacement therapy in this population may be warranted; however, further RCTs are urgently needed to establish when to begin vitamin D therapy, as well as to determine the dose and route and duration of administration.",Muscogiuri G; Sorice GP; Ajjan R; Mezza T; Pilz S; Prioletta A; Scragg R; Volpe SL; Witham MD; Giaccari A,"Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22265795/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22229755,Epigenetic manifestation of metabolic syndrome and dietary management.,"Metabolic syndrome constitutes a group of disorders such as insulin resistance, hypertension, and hypertriglyceridemia, predisposing an individual to risk factors such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia. A majority of these diseases are influenced by the environmental factors, nutrient uptake, and genetic profile of an individual that together dysregulate gene function. These genetic and nongenetic factors are reported to introduce epigenetic cues that modulate the gene function which is inherited by the offspring. Considering the epigenetic modulation of the metabolic disorders, nutrigenomics has been distinctly categorized as a branch that deals with modulatory effect of nutrients on metabolic disorders and disease progression by supplementing the individuals with key nutrient-enriched diets which are derived from plant and animal sources. Nutritional components of the diet regulate the metabolic health of an individual either by controlling the expression of some key genes related to metabolic pathways or by modulating the epigenetic events on such genes. The present article discusses various metabolic disorders in detail and the effect of nutrients on the specific genes causing those disorders. We also highlight the molecular mechanisms of some metabolic disorders through epigenetic modifications and possible therapeutic interventions. With the advent of high-throughput technologies and epigenetic modulation of the metabolic disorders, an altered epigenetic code that is programmed due to improper nutrients can be reverted back by supplementing the diet with various plant-derived compounds. The implication of small molecular drugs is also of utmost significance for challenging the metabolic disorders.",Chaudhary N; Nakka KK; Maulik N; Chattopadhyay S,Antioxidants & redox signaling,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22229755/,1,0,0,0,0,0

In the clinical setting, large epidemiological studies show that low dietary magnesium intake is associated with the increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes; however, results from randomized controlled clinical trials that have evaluated the beneficial effects of magnesium supplementation on glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity are controversial. In this article we searched (in the electronic databases of Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register up to June 2011) the evidence derived from epidemiological studies and clinical trials, about the relationship between magnesium and type 2 diabetes.

22178957,Natural isothiocyanates: genotoxic potential versus chemoprevention.,"Isothiocyanates, occurring in many dietary cruciferous vegetables, show interesting chemopreventive activities against several chronic-degenerative diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegeneration, diabetes. The electrophilic carbon residue in the isothiocyanate moiety reacts with biological nucleophiles and modification of proteins is recognized as a key mechanism underlying the biological activity of isothiocyanates. The nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 system, which orchestrates the expression of a wide array of antioxidant genes, plays a role in the protective effect of isothiocyanates against almost all the pathological conditions reported above. Recent emerging findings suggest a further common mechanism. Chronic inflammation plays a central role in many human diseases and isothiocyanates inhibit the activity of many inflammation components, suppress cyclooxygenase 2, and irreversibly inactivate the macrophage migration inhibitory factor. Due to their electrophilic reactivity, some isothiocyanates are able to form adducts with DNA and induce gene mutations and chromosomal aberrations. DNA damage has been demonstrated to be involved in the pathogenesis of various chronic-degenerative diseases of epidemiological relevance. Thus, the genotoxicity of the isothiocyanates should be carefully considered. In addition, the dose-response relationship for genotoxic compounds does not suggest evidence of a threshold. Thus, chemicals that are genotoxic pose a greater potential risk to humans than non-genotoxic compounds. Dietary consumption levels of isothiocyanates appear to be several orders of magnitude lower than the doses used in the genotoxicity studies and thus it is highly unlikely that such toxicities would occur in humans. However, the beneficial properties of isothiocyanates stimulated an increase of dietary supplements and functional foods with highly enriched isothiocyanate concentrations on the market. Whether such concentrations may exert a potential health risk cannot be excluded with certainty and an accurate evaluation of the toxicological profile of isothiocyanates should be prompted before any major increase in their consumption be recommended or their clinical use suggested.",Fimognari C; Turrini E; Ferruzzi L; Lenzi M; Hrelia P,Mutation research,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22178957/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Strict preconceptional and early pregnancy glucose control, supplementation with multivitamins and fatty acids, and lower glycemic dietary management have been shown to reduce the incidence of birth defects in experimental and epidemiologic studies. However, because more than half of pregnancies are unplanned, these methods are not generalizable across the population. Thus, better interventions are urgently needed.

22134503,Role of carnitine in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity: evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies with carnitine supplementation and carnitine deficiency.,"Although carnitine is best known for its role in the import of long-chain fatty acids (acyl groups) into the mitochondrial matrix for subsequent β-oxidation, carnitine is also necessary for the efflux of acyl groups out of the mitochondria. Since intracellular accumulation of acyl-CoA derivatives has been implicated in the development of insulin resistance, carnitine supplementation has gained attention as a tool for the treatment of insulin resistance. More recent studies even point toward a causative role for carnitine insufficiency in developing insulin resistance during states of chronic metabolic stress, such as obesity, which can be reversed by carnitine supplementation. The present review provides an overview about data from both animal and human studies reporting effects of either carnitine supplementation or carnitine deficiency on parameters of glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in order to establish the less well-recognized role of carnitine in regulating glucose homeostasis. Carnitine supplementation studies in both humans and animals demonstrate an improvement of glucose tolerance, in particular during insulin-resistant states. In contrast, less consistent results are available from animal studies investigating the association between carnitine deficiency and glucose intolerance. The majority of studies dealing with this question could either find no association or even reported that carnitine deficiency lowers blood glucose and improves insulin sensitivity. In view of the abovementioned beneficial effect of carnitine supplementation on glucose tolerance during insulin-resistant states, carnitine supplementation might be an effective tool for improvement of glucose utilization in obese type 2 diabetic patients. However, further studies are necessary to explain the conflicting observations from studies dealing with carnitine deficiency.",Ringseis R; Keller J; Eder K,European journal of nutrition,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22134503/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The health effects of the whole fruit, as well as its juices and extracts, have been studied in relation to a variety of chronic diseases. Promising results against cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and prostate cancer have been reported from human clinical trials. The in vitro antioxidant activity of pomegranate has been attributed to its high polyphenolic content, specifically punicalagins, punicalins, gallagic acid, and ellagic acid. These compounds are metabolized during digestion to ellagic acid and urolithins, suggesting that the bioactive compounds that provide in vivo antioxidant activity may not be the same as those present in the whole food. Anthocyanins and the unique fatty acid profile of the seed oil may also play a role in pomegranate's health effects.

22110483,Vasoprotection by dietary supplements and exercise: role of TNFα signaling.,"Vascular dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular diseases. Dietary supplements, including fish oil, dietary fibers, and various natural products, and exercise training exert vasoprotective effects. However, the mechanisms underlying the vasoprotective benefits of dietary supplements and physical activity demand extensive investigation. Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) plays a pivotal role in the dysregulation of macrovascular and microvascular function. TNFα induces vascular inflammation, monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, vascular oxidative stress, apoptosis, and atherogenic response and participates in the regulation of thrombosis and coagulation through multiple signaling pathways involving NFκB, Sp1, activator protein 1, JNK, p38, STAT3, and so forth.

22107597,Functional food and diabetes: a natural way in diabetes prevention?,"Diabetes shows a wide range of variation in prevalence around the world and it is expected to affect 300 million by the year 2025. In a prevention framework where banning policies and educational strategies lead the interventions, functional foods (FFs) with their specific health effects could, in the future, indicate a new mode of thinking about the relationships between food and health in everyday life. Functional ingredients, such as stevioside, cinnamon, bitter melon, garlic and onion, ginseng, Gymnema sylvestre and fenugreek, have been addressed for their specific actions towards different reactions involved in diabetes development. New strategies involving the use of FF should be validated through large-scale population trials, considering validated surrogate end points to evaluate the effect of FF in prevention of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus.",Ballali S; Lanciai F,International journal of food sciences and nutrition,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22107597/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22101980,In sickness and in health: the widespread application of creatine supplementation.,"There is an extensive and still growing body of the literature supporting the efficacy of creatine (Cr) supplementation. In sports, creatine has been recognized as the most effective nutritional supplement in enhancing exercise tolerance, muscle strength and lean body mass. From a clinical perspective, the application of Cr supplementation is indeed exciting. Evidences of benefits from this supplement have been reported in a broad range of diseases, including myopathies, neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, rheumatic diseases, and type 2 diabetes. In addition, after hundreds of published studies and millions of exposures creatine supplementation maintains an excellent safety profile. Thus, we contend that the widespread application of this supplement may benefit athletes, elderly people and various patient populations. In this narrative review, we aimed to summarize both the ergogenic and therapeutic effects of Cr supplementation. Furthermore, we reviewed the impact of Cr supplementation on kidney function.",Gualano B; Roschel H; Lancha AH; Brightbill CE; Rawson ES,Amino acids,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22101980/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22093965,Controversies surrounding the clinical potential of cinnamon for the management of diabetes.,"Obesity levels have increased significantly in the past five decades and are predicted to continue rising, resulting in important health implications. In particular, this has translated to an increase in the occurrence of type II diabetes mellitus (T2D). To alleviate associated problems, certain nutraceuticals have been considered as potential adjuncts or alternatives to conventional prescription drugs. Cinnamon, a commonly consumed spice originating from South East Asia, is currently being investigated as a potential preventative supplement and treatment for insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and T2D. Extensive in vitro evidence has shown that cinnamon may improve insulin resistance by preventing and reversing impairments in insulin signalling in skeletal muscle. In adipose tissue, it has been shown that cinnamon increases the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors including, PPARγ. This is comparable to the action of commonly used thiazolinediones, which are PPAR agonists. Studies have also shown that cinnamon has potent anti-inflammatory properties. However, numerous human clinical trials with cinnamon have been conducted with varying findings. While some studies have showed no beneficial effect, others have indicated improvements in cholesterol levels, systolic blood pressure, insulin sensitivity and postprandial glucose levels with cinnamon. However, the only measurement consistently improved by cinnamon consumption is fasting glucose levels. While it is still premature to suggest the use of cinnamon supplementation based on the evidence, further investigation into mechanisms of action is warranted. Apart from further characterization of genetic and epigenetic changes in model systems, systematic large-scale clinical trials are required. In this study, we discuss the mechanisms of action of cinnamon in the context of T2D and we highlight some of the associated controversies.",Rafehi H; Ververis K; Karagiannis TC,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22093965/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22082324,Metabolic correction in the management of diabetic peripheral neuropathy: improving clinical results beyond symptom control.,"Current Clinical Management Guidelines of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) are based on adequate glucose control and symptomatic pain relief. However, meticulous glycemic control could delay the onset or slow the progression of diabetic neuropathy in patients with DM type 2, but it does not completely prevent the progression of the disease. Complications of DPN as it continues its natural course, produce increasing pain and discomfort, loss of sensation, ulcers, infections, amputations and even death. In addition to the increased suffering, disability and loss of productivity, there is a very significant economic impact related to the treatment of DPN and its complications. In USA alone, it has been estimated that there are more than 5,000,000 patients suffering from DPN and the total annual cost of treating the disease and its complications is over $10,000 million dollars. In order to be able to reduce complications of DPN, it is crucial to improve or correct the metabolic conditions that lead to the pathology present in this condition. Pathophysiologic mechanisms implicated in diabetic neuropathy include: increased polyol pathway with accumulation of sorbitol and reduced Na+/K+-ATPase activity, microvascular damage and hypoxia due to nitric oxide deficit and increased oxygen free radical activity. Moreover, there is a decrease in glutathione and increase in homocysteine. Clinical trials in the last two decades have demonstrated that the use of specific nutrients can correct some of these metabolic derangements, improving symptom control and providing further benefits such as improved sensorium, blood flow and nerve regeneration. We will discuss the evidence on lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, benfotiamine and the combination of active B vitamins L-methylfolate, methylcobalamin and piridoxal-6-phosphate. In addition, we discuss the role of metformin, an important drug in the management of diabetes, and the presence of specific polymorphic genes, in the risk of developing DPN and how metabolic correction can reduce these risks.",Miranda-Massari JR; Gonzalez MJ; Jimenez FJ; Allende-Vigo MZ; Duconge J,Current clinical pharmacology,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22082324/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22071549,Zinc and human health: an update.,"The importance of micronutrients in health and nutrition is undisputable, and among them, zinc is an essential element whose significance to health is increasingly appreciated and whose deficiency may play an important role in the appearance of diseases. Zinc is one of the most important trace elements in the organism, with three major biological roles, as catalyst, structural, and regulatory ion. Zinc-binding motifs are found in many proteins encoded by the human genome physiologically, and free zinc is mainly regulated at the single-cell level. Zinc has critical effect in homeostasis, in immune function, in oxidative stress, in apoptosis, and in aging, and significant disorders of great public health interest are associated with zinc deficiency. In many chronic diseases, including atherosclerosis, several malignancies, neurological disorders, autoimmune diseases, aging, age-related degenerative diseases, and Wilson's disease, the concurrent zinc deficiency may complicate the clinical features, affect adversely immunological status, increase oxidative stress, and lead to the generation of inflammatory cytokines. In these diseases, oxidative stress and chronic inflammation may play important causative roles. It is therefore important that status of zinc is assessed in any case and zinc deficiency is corrected, since the unique properties of zinc may have significant therapeutic benefits in these diseases. In the present paper, we review the zinc as a multipurpose trace element, its biological role in homeostasis, proliferation and apoptosis and its role in immunity and in chronic diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, depression, Wilson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and other age-related diseases.",Chasapis CT; Loutsidou AC; Spiliopoulou CA; Stefanidou ME,Archives of toxicology,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22071549/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22054960,Seaweed lipids as nutraceuticals.,"Seaweeds are known as low-energy food. Despite low lipid content, ω-3 and ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) introduce a significant part of seaweed lipids. PUFAs are the important components of all cell membranes and precursors of eicosanoids that are essential bioregulators of many cellular processes. PUFAs effectively reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, ostheoporosis, and diabetes. Because of the frequent usage of seaweeds in Asia and their increasing utilization as food also in other parts of the world, seaweeds could contribute to the improvement of a low level of ω-3 PUFAs, especially in the Western diet. The major commercial sources of ω-3 PUFAs are fish, but their wide usage as food additives is limited for the typical fishy smell, unpleasant taste, and oxidative nonstability. Nevertheless, growing requirements of healthy functional foods have led to produce PUFAs as nutraceuticals in controlled batch culture of marine microalgae, especially Thraustochytrium and Schizochytrium strains.",Mišurcová L; Ambrožová J; Samek D,Advances in food and nutrition research,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22054960/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22051430,The role of magnesium in hypertension and cardiovascular disease.,"Magnesium intake of 500 mg/d to 1000 mg/d may reduce blood pressure (BP) as much as 5.6/2.8 mm Hg. However, clinical studies have a wide range of BP reduction, with some showing no change in BP. The combination of increased intake of magnesium and potassium coupled with reduced sodium intake is more effective in reducing BP than single mineral intake and is often as effective as one antihypertensive drug in treating hypertension. Reducing intracellular sodium and calcium while increasing intracellular magnesium and potassium improves BP response. Magnesium also increases the effectiveness of all antihypertensive drug classes. It remains to be conclusively proven that cardiovascular disease such as coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and cardiac arrhythmias can be prevented or treated with magnesium intake. Preliminary evidence suggests that insulin sensitivity, hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, left ventricular hypertrophy, and dyslipidemia may be improved with increased magnesium intake. Various genetic defects in magnesium transport are associated with hypertension and possibly with cardiovascular disease. Oral magnesium acts as a natural calcium channel blocker, increases nitric oxide, improves endothelial dysfunction, and induces direct and indirect vasodilation.",Houston M,"Journal of clinical hypertension (Greenwich, Conn.)",2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22051430/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Because some epigenetic changes can be reversed chemically, epigenetics has tremendous implications for disease intervention and treatment. After epigenetic components in cancer were characterized, genes and pathways are being characterized in other diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and neurological disorders. Observational, experimental, and clinical studies in different diseases have shown that nutrients influence epigenetic regulation. Nutrients such as folic acid that supply methyl groups have been shown to have a protective effect in colon cancer. Identifying steps during epigenetic regulation and developing intervention and treatment agents are the critical issues in the field. Following completion and validation of key observational studies in nutritional epigenetics, strategies can be developed for cancer control and treatment.",Verma M,Antioxidants & redox signaling,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22047027/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22037013,Leucine as a pharmaconutrient in health and disease.,"Amino acids do not merely represent precursors for de-novo protein synthesis, but also function as nutritional signals regulating various metabolic processes. In fact, ample evidence has been generated to show that various tissues respond to changes in amino acid availability via signal transduction pathways that are also regulated by hormones such as insulin, glucagon, and insulin-like growth factor 1. Amino acids, and leucine in particular, can act as strong insulin secretagogues when administered in combination with carbohydrate. Leucine administration can be applied effectively to improve postprandial glycemic control. Furthermore, amino acids have been shown to stimulate mRNA translation, thereby increasing muscle protein synthesis and stimulating net protein accretion in an insulin-independent manner. These anabolic properties of amino acids have been mainly attributed to the essential amino acids, and leucine in particular. In accordance, the recent in-vivo human studies show that leucine ingestion can augment the blunted muscle protein synthetic response to protein or amino acid ingestion in elderly men. Leucine has been proposed as a promising pharmaconutrient in the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia and/or type 2 diabetes. Though there are numerous applications for the proposed benefits of leucine in health and disease, the recent long-term nutritional intervention studies do not confirm the clinical efficacy of leucine as a pharmaconutrient.",van Loon LJ,Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22037013/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22029833,Leucine as a pharmaconutrient to prevent and treat sarcopenia and type 2 diabetes.,"Amino acids function as precursors for de novo protein synthesis. In addition, however, they play a key role as nutritional signals that regulate multiple cellular processes. There is ample in vitro and in vivo evidence showing that muscle tissue responds to increases in amino acid availability via signal transduction pathways that are also regulated by insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, and insulin growth factor 1. The increased amino acid availibility results in the upregulation of mRNA translation, thereby increasing muscle protein synthesis, which, in turn, leads to greater net muscle protein accretion. These findings have been particularly pronounced for the amino acid leucine. Furthermore, leucine has the ability to act as a strong insulin secretagogue. Consequently, it has been suggested that leucine represents an effective pharmaconutrient for the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia and type 2 diabetes. In accordance, recent in vivo studies in humans show that free leucine ingestion can reverse the blunted response of muscle protein synthesis to amino acid/protein intake in the elderly. Although short-term studies suggest that leucine supplementation can stimulate muscle mass accretion in the elderly, there are no long-term nutritional intervention studies to confirm this or the other proposed benefits of leucine as a pharmaconutrient.",Leenders M; van Loon LJ,Nutrition reviews,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22029833/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22011638,Vitamin D levels and potential impact in systemic sclerosis.,"Vitamin D is essential not only for calcium and bone metabolism, but it also may exert other biological activities, including immunomodulation through the expression of vitamin D receptor in antigen-presenting cells and activated T cells. Evidence from animal models and human prospective studies of rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, type I diabetes, and systemic lupus erythematosus, indeed suggested an important role for vitamin D as a modifiable environmental factor in autoimmune diseases. In systemic sclerosis (SSc), this role has not been completely dissected, although recent studies clearly evidenced a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. Moreover, some degree of association between vitamin D deficiency and disease activity or phenotype characteristics has also been observed. Vitamin D deficiency in SSc may be related to several factors: insufficient sun exposure due to disability and skin fibrosis, insufficient intake because of gut involvement and malabsorption. Although it is advisable to regularly check vitamin D status in these patients, there is no consensus about which vitamin D supplementation regimen might be sufficient to modulate immunological homeostasis, and possibly reduce disease activity or severity, thus further prospective studies are needed. Moreover, novel vitamin D analogues with more pronounced immune modulatory effect and lower activity on calcium metabolism are in the pipeline, and might represent a great innovative opportunity for the treatment of vitamin D deficiency in such autoimmune disorders.",Vacca A; Cormier C; Mathieu A; Kahan A; Allanore Y,Clinical and experimental rheumatology,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22011638/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22004631,The role of carbohydrate drinks in pre-operative nutrition for elective colorectal surgery.,"Traditionally, patients have been fasted from midnight on the night before elective surgery. With the advent of the enhanced recovery programme for elective colorectal surgery, there has been a major change in established practice with patients able to continue with clear fluids up to two hours prior to surgery and solids up to six hours prior to surgery. It has been suggested that nutritional supplements in the immediate pre-operative period enhance post-operative recovery. The aim of this review was therefore critically to appraise the evidence available regarding the use of pre-operative carbohydrate (CHO) supplements for elective colorectal surgery. A literature search was performed using: PubMed, MEDLINE(®), Athens and Google Scholar. The following keywords were used: 'pre-operative', 'carbohydrate supplements', 'enhanced recovery' and 'colorectal surgery', singly or in combination. To ensure an up-to-date literature search, the search was restricted to the last ten years. To maximise the search, backward chaining of reference lists from retrieved papers was also undertaken. Only English language articles were included. The use of CHO drinks pre-operatively in colorectal surgery is both safe and effective. There is no increased risk of aspiration and it results in a shorter hospital stay, a quicker return of bowel function and less loss of muscle mass. On the basis of this evidence, the use of pre-operative CHO drinks should be standard in elective colorectal patients. Further research is nevertheless required for those with diabetes mellitus.",Jones C; Badger SA; Hannon R,Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22004631/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22001972,Lipoic acid - biological activity and therapeutic potential.,"α-Lipoic acid (LA; 5-(1,2-dithiolan-3-yl)pentanoic acid) was originally isolated from bovine liver by Reed et al. in 1951. LA was once considered a vitamin. Subsequently, it was found that LA is not a vitamin and is synthesized by plants and animals. LA is covalently bound to the ε-amino group of lysine residues and functions as a cofactor for mitochondrial enzymes by catalyzing the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, α-ketoglutarate and branched-chain α-keto acids. LA and its reduced form - dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), meet all the criteria for an ideal antioxidant because they can easily quench radicals, can chelate metals, have an amphiphlic character and they do not exhibit any serious side effects. They interact with other antioxidants and can regenerate them. For this reason, LA is called an antioxidant of antioxidants. LA has an influence on the second messenger nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and attenuates the release of free radicals and cytotoxic cytokines. The therapeutic action of LA is based on its antioxidant properties. Current studies support its use in the ancillary treatment of many diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, autoimmune diseases, cancer and AIDS. This review was undertaken to gather the most recent information regarding the therapeutic properties of LA and its possible utility in disease treatment.",Gorąca A; Huk-Kolega H; Piechota A; Kleniewska P; Ciejka E; Skibska B,Pharmacological reports : PR,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22001972/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Increasing evidence suggests that this mineral plays an important role in normal growth and reproduction in animals and humans, and selenium supplementation is now recommended as part of public health policy in geographical areas with severe selenium deficiency in soil. This review addresses the biological functions of selenium followed by a detailed review of associations between selenium status and reproductive health. In many countries, selenium dietary intake falls below the recommended nutrient intakes and is inadequate to support maximal expression of the selenoenzymes. Numerous reports implicate selenium deficiency in several reproductive and obstetric complications including male and female infertility, miscarriage, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, preterm labor, gestational diabetes, and obstetric cholestasis. Currently, there is inadequate information from the available small intervention studies to inform public health strategies. Larger intervention trials are required to reinforce or refute a beneficial role of selenium supplementation in disorders of reproductive health.",Mistry HD; Broughton Pipkin F; Redman CW; Poston L,American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21963101/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21903714,Vitamin D and the postmenopausal population.,"Vitamin D, a hormone critical to the body's maintenance of serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations, is currently the subject of much scientific interest. Low levels of vitamin D have been observed in many populations and epidemiological studies have suggested a link between this biochemical state and a range of diseases, such as cancer, diabetes and multiple sclerosis. While the consequence of vitamin D deficiency is well documented for bone (rickets and osteomalacia), with mixed findings relating to falls and fractures, a causal link between vitamin D deficiency and these wider health outcomes has not been established. If these relationships were found to be causal, the morbidity and mortality resulting from low levels of vitamin D could be substantial; the current evidence base, however, most robustly supports the assessment of serum 25(OH)-vitamin D in the context of specific symptoms, low bone mineral density or biochemical abnormalities, rather than as an entity to treat in its own right or as the basis for a population-wide screening programme.",Holroyd CR; Cooper C; Harvey NC,Menopause international,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21903714/,1,0,0,0,0,0

21882122,"Calcium supplementation, osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease.","Adequate intakes of calcium and vitamin D are essential preventive strategies and essential parts of any therapeutic regimen for osteoporosis. However, calcium supplementation is not without controversy and benefits on skeletal health need to be balanced against potential risks on cardiovascular disease. The published data so far suggest a potential detrimental effect of calcium supplement on cardiovascular health (i.e. myocardial infarction) although further prospective studies are needed to clarify the gradient of risk. Since food sources of calcium produce similar benefits on bone density as supplements and dietary calcium intake does not seem to be related with adverse cardiovascular effects, calcium intake from nutritional sources needs to be enforced. In patients with low calcium intake supplements are warranted aiming for a total calcium intake of 800 to 1000 mg/d together with adequate vitamin D replacement. Nevertheless we should keep in mind that for significant reduction in fracture risk, pharmacological treatment is mandatory in patients at risk of fractures irrespective of calcium and vitamin D supplementation.",Meier C; Kränzlin ME,Swiss medical weekly,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21882122/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21864283,Phytosterols: perspectives in human nutrition and clinical therapy.,"Phytosterols (PSs) are a group of plant derived steroid alcohols, with wide occurrence in vegetables and fruits. They are integral components of plant cell membranes, having stabilizing effects on phospholipids bilayer, just like cholesterol in animal cell membranes. Structural resemblance of PSs with cholesterol enables them to displace low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the human intestine. Protective effects of PSs against cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), colon and breast cancer developments have been widely documented. Several reports have been published on the potential dietary intake of common PSs, such as β-sitosterol, stigmasterol and campesterol, and their safety concerns. Ability of PSs to reduce cholesterol levels and risks associated with heart problems has made them a class of favorite food supplements. Nowadays functional foods supplemented with PSs have become an alternative and healthy tool to lower LDL-cholesterol levels in a natural way. However, excessive use of PSs has been observed to develop premature coronary artery disease in phytosterolemic patients, high risk of atherosclerotic CVDs, myocardial infarction and even impaired endothelial functions. This manuscript will highlight the recent developments in PSs with particular focus on their role as dietary supplements and in treatment of various heart- and cholesterol-related ailments.

The mechanisms for these effects have not been fully elucidated. Fenugreek seeds contain 45.4% dietary fiber (32% insoluble and 13.3% soluble), and the gum is composed of galactose and mannose. The latter compounds are associated with reduced glycemia and cholesterolemia. Fenugreek's hypoglycemic effect has been especially documented in humans and animals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, this dietary fiber has potential for widespread use in the food industry because its galactomannan composition has emulsifying and stabilizing properties. Flour supplemented with 8%-10% fenugreek dietary fiber has been used in the production of baked goods such as bread, pizza, muffins, and cakes.

These recommendations will be discussed along with recent observational data and a recently completed randomized controlled trial dealing with vitamin D requirements during pregnancy. Current evidence supports the concept that circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be 40-60  ng/ml (100-150  nmol) during pregnancy and a daily intake of 4000  IU vitamin D3 is required to attain that circulating level.",Hollis BW; Wagner CL,"Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity",2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21857221/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21854698,Pathogenic obesity and nutraceuticals.,"Over a decade of intense research in the field of obesity has led to the knowledge that chronic, excessive adipose tissue expansion leads to an increase in the risk for CVD, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cancer. This is primarily thought to stem from the low-grade, systemic inflammatory response syndrome that characterises adipose tissue in obesity, and this itself is thought to arise from the complex interplay of factors including metabolic endotoxaemia, increased plasma NEFA, hypertrophic adipocytes and localised hypoxia. Plasma concentrations of vitamins and antioxidants are lower in obese individuals than in the non-obese, which is hypothesised to negatively affect the development of inflammation and disease in obesity. This paper provides a review of the current literature investigating the potential of nutraceuticals to ameliorate the development of oxidative stress and inflammation in obesity, thereby limiting the onset of obesity complications. Research has found nutraceuticals able to positively modulate the activity of adipocyte cell lines and further positive effects have been found in other aspects of pathogenic obesity. While their ability to affect weight loss is still controversial, it is clear that they have a great potential to reverse the development of overweight and obesity-related comorbidities; this, however, still requires much research especially that utilising well-structured randomised controlled trials.",Conroy KP; Davidson IM; Warnock M,The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21854698/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21831036,Role of ω3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in reducing cardio-metabolic risk factors.,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in many economically developed nations, and its incidence is increasing at a rapid rate in emerging economies. Diet and lifestyle issues are closely associated with a myriad of cardiovascular disease risk factors including abnormal plasma lipids, hypertension, insulin resistance, diabetes and obesity, suggesting that diet-based approaches may be of benefit. Omega-3 longchain-polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω3 LC-PUFA) are increasingly being used in the prevention and management of several cardiovascular risk factors. Both the ω3 and ω6 PUFA families are considered essential, as the human body is itself unable to synthesize them. The conversion of the two precursor fatty acids - linoleic acid (18:2ω6) and α-linoleic acid (α18:3ω3) - of these two pathways to longer (≥C(20)) PUFA is inefficient. Although there is an abundance of ω6 PUFA in the food supply; in many populations the relative intake of ω3 LC-PUFA is low with health authorities advocating increased consumption. Fish oil, rich in eicosapentaenoic (EPA, 20:5ω3) and docosahexaenoic (DHA, 22:6ω3) acids, has been found to cause a modest reduction in blood pressure at a dose level of >3g/d both in untreated and treated hypertensives. Whilst a multitude of mechanisms may contribute to the blood pressure lowering action of ω3 LC-PUFA, improved vascular endothelial cell function appears to play a central role. Recent studies which evaluated the potential benefits of fish oil in type-2 diabetes have helped to alleviate concerns raised in some previous studies which used relatively large dose (5-8 g/d) and reported a worsening of glycemic control. Several meta-analyses have confirmed that the most consistent action of ω3 LC-PUFA in insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes is the reduction in triglycerides. In some studies, fish oil has been found to cause a small rise in LDL-cholesterol, but a change in the LDL particle size, from the smaller more atherogenic form to the larger, less damaging particle size, have also been noted. ω3 LC-PUFA are effective modulators of the inflammation that accompanies several cardio-metabolic abnormalities. Taking into consideration the pleiotropic nature of their actions, it can be concluded that dietary supplementation with ω3 LC-PUFA will lead to improvements in cardio-metabolic health parameters. These fatty acids pose only minor side effects and more importantly, do not interact adversely with the common drug therapies used in the management and treatment of hypertension, dyslipidemia, type-2 diabetes, and obesity/metabolic syndrome, but in some instances work synergistically, thereby providing additional cardiovascular benefits.",Abeywardena MY; Patten GS,"Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21831036/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21831034,5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and the metabolic syndrome.,"Lifestyle changes such as physical inactivity combined with calorie-rich, low-fibre diets have triggered an explosive surge in metabolic syndrome, outlined as a cluster of heart attack risk factors such as insulin resistance, raised fasting plasma glucose, abdominal obesity, high cholesterol and high blood pressure. By acting as a master-switch of energy homeostasis and associated pathophysiological phenomena, 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) appears to orchestrate the adaptive physiology of energy deficit, suggesting that the sedentary modern human could be suffering from chronic suboptimal AMPK activation. Addressing individual targets with potent ligands with high specificity may be inappropriate (it has not yielded any molecule superior to the sixty year old metformin) because this strategy cannot address a cluster of interrelated pathologies. However, spices, dietary supplements and nutraceuticals attenuate the multiple symptoms of metabolic syndrome in a collective and perhaps more holistic fashion with fewer adverse events. Natural selection could have favoured races that developed a taste for spices and dietary supplements, most of which are not only antioxidants but also activators of AMPK. The review will outline the various biochemical mechanisms and pathophysiological consequences of AMPK activation involving the cluster of symptoms that embrace metabolic syndrome and beyond. Recent advances that integrate energy homeostasis with a number of overarching metabolic pathways and physiological phenomena, including inflammatory conditions, cell growth and development, malignancy, life span, and even extending into environmental millieu, as in obesity mediated by gut microflora and others will also be outlined.",Mor V; Unnikrishnan MK,"Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21831034/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The concept of relative vitamin D deficiency in patients with PDB was suggested long ago, but it has not yet elucidated. Both diseases predispose to fractures, but their combined action to fragility has not been studied yet. The older BPs, mainly etidronate, further inhibit bone mineralization. Mineralization defects have also been described in patients with PDB treated with pamidronate. Moreover, hypocalcemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism after treatment with BPs have been described in PDB. Hypocalcemia seems to be more severe after treatment with the more potent, intravenous zoledronic acid, which is currently the treatment of choice for PDB. The counteracting hyperparathyroidism pathophysiologically intends to increase renal reabsorption of calcium and 1.25-dihydroxy vitamin D production and to stimulate osteoclasts in order to prevent long-term hypocalcemia. However, the effect of PTH on osteoclasts is, at least partly, restricted in patients taking BPs. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a potentially detrimental condition, especially in patients already suffering from another bone disease. Serum calcium and vitamin D deficiency should be restored before BP treatment and calcium and vitamin D administration should be possibly continued for longer after achieving normocalcemia, which may shorten the duration of secondary hyperparathyroidism. QUICK SUMMARY: Mineralization defects and hypocalcemia with secondary hyperparathyroidism have been described in patients with Paget's disease of bone treated with bisphosphonates. Secondary hyperparathyroidism may be a potentially detrimental condition for patients with Paget's disease of bone.",Polyzos SA; Anastasilakis AD; Makras P; Terpos E,"Experimental and clinical endocrinology & diabetes : official journal, German Society of Endocrinology [and] German Diabetes Association",2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21811962/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21798349,Dietary phytochemicals and their potential effects on obesity: a review.,"The incidence of obesity is rising at an alarming rate and is becoming a major public health concern with incalculable social costs. Indeed, obesity facilitates the development of metabolic disorders such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases in addition to chronic diseases such as stroke, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, some cancers, and inflammation-bases pathologies. In this review we summarize the progresses made in our understanding of obesity, including the role of inflammation process, the recently understood endocrine function of adipose tissue, as well as passive roles of processes of energy storage and adipogenesis related to fat cell lifecycle: differentiation, maturation, and apoptosis. In addition, the article discusses the anti-obesity potential of dietary phytochemicals and analyzes their mechanisms of action, e.g. induction of apoptosis and lipolysis and inhibition of inflammation.",González-Castejón M; Rodriguez-Casado A,Pharmacological research,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21798349/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21795456,Clinical Review: The 2011 report on dietary reference intake for vitamin D: where do we go from here?,"The Institute of Medicine (IOM) report on dietary reference intakes (DRI) for vitamin D is reviewed, along with its implications. Evidence-based reviews were completed; the IOM committee conducted its own literature search, an open public workshop, and two open sessions, and maintained a public web site for stakeholder input. The consensus report of the 14 scientists on the committee was reviewed by a panel of experts. Only bone health could be used as an indicator for DRI development. Evidence for extraskeletal outcomes was inadequate, inconsistent, or insufficient to develop DRI. The recommended dietary allowance was found to be 600 IU/d for ages 1-70 yr, corresponding on average to a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) level of at least 50 nmol/liter (20 ng/ml), and 800 IU/d for those older than 70 yr. Comparison with current levels of 25OHD in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey population survey revealed that the vitamin D intake in the United States and Canada is adequate. An upper limit was set at 4000 IU/d for adults, corresponding to an average serum 25OHD level of 125 nmol/liter (50 ng/ml). Previous reports of an epidemic of vitamin D deficiency in North America were based on an overestimation of adequacy. Population screening with serum 25OHD is therefore not warranted. Current laboratory reference ranges for serum 25OHD are overestimated and should be revised. Practice guidelines to treat disease should not be applied to the healthy American population where use of the DRI is appropriate.",Aloia JF,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21795456/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21793849,Inflammation-mediated obesity and insulin resistance as targets for nutraceuticals.,"Obesity-induced inflammation plays an important role in the development of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and metabolic dysfunctions. Chronic activation of proinflammatory pathways within insulin target cells can lead to obesity-related insulin resistance. The inflammatory mediators consist of immune cells, cytokines, adipokines, and inflammatory signaling molecules. Targeting obesity-associated inflammation has been shown to protect experimental animals and human subjects from obesity-induced insulin resistance. Modulation of the inflammatory responses associated with obesity may help prevent or improve obesity-induced metabolic dysfunctions. In this review, we introduce the beneficial effects of nutraceuticals for targeting inflammation in the treatment of obesity-induced insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunctions.",Kim MS; Lee MS; Kown DY,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21793849/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21774781,Nutrapharmacology of tocotrienols for metabolic syndrome.,"Metabolic syndrome is defined as a set of health risk factors that are associated with an increased chance of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. These include abdominal obesity, hyperglycemia, impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Interventions in metabolic syndrome include lifestyle interventions such as a healthy diet using functional foods together with increased physical activity to induce weight loss as the first aim of treatment. Nutraceuticals such as tocotrienols and tocopherols as members of the vitamin E family may be more targeted interventions. This review evaluates the effects of tocotrienols on the risk factors of metabolic syndrome using data from human, animal and in vitro studies. Tocotrienols improved lipid profiles and reduced atherosclerotic lesions, decreased blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin concentrations, normalized blood pressure, and inhibited adipogenesis. The differences in responses between tocopherols and tocotrienols in preventing obesity, diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis, ischemia, and inflammation suggest that different receptors or signaling mechanisms may be involved.",Weng-Yew W; Brown L,Current pharmaceutical design,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21774781/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21731036,An estimate of the global reduction in mortality rates through doubling vitamin D levels.,"The goal of this work is to estimate the reduction in mortality rates for six geopolitical regions of the world under the assumption that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels increase from 54 to 110 nmol/l. This study is based on interpretation of the journal literature relating to the effects of solar ultraviolet-B (UVB) and vitamin D in reducing the risk of disease and estimates of the serum 25(OH)D level-disease risk relations for cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and respiratory infections. The vitamin D-sensitive diseases that account for more than half of global mortality rates are CVD, cancer, respiratory infections, respiratory diseases, tuberculosis and diabetes mellitus. Additional vitamin D-sensitive diseases and conditions that account for 2 to 3% of global mortality rates are Alzheimer's disease, falls, meningitis, Parkinson's disease, maternal sepsis, maternal hypertension (pre-eclampsia) and multiple sclerosis. Increasing serum 25(OH)D levels from 54 to 110 nmol/l would reduce the vitamin D-sensitive disease mortality rate by an estimated 20%. The reduction in all-cause mortality rates range from 7.6% for African females to 17.3% for European females. Reductions for males average 0.6% lower than for females. The estimated increase in life expectancy is 2 years for all six regions. Increasing serum 25(OH)D levels is the most cost-effective way to reduce global mortality rates, as the cost of vitamin D is very low and there are few adverse effects from oral intake and/or frequent moderate UVB irradiance with sufficient body surface area exposed.",Grant WB,European journal of clinical nutrition,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21731036/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21731035,Vitamin D and type 2 diabetes: a systematic review.,"Vitamin D may modify the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this review was to examine the association between vitamin D status and incident type 2 diabetes, and the effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycemic outcomes. We performed a systematic review of English-language studies using MEDLINE through February 2011. Longitudinal cohort studies reporting associations between vitamin D status and incident type 2 diabetes, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of vitamin D supplementation, were included. Study characteristics and results were extracted, and study quality was assessed. A total of 8 observational cohort studies and 11 RCTs were included. In meta-analyses of observational studies, vitamin D intake>500 international units (IU)/day decreased the risk of type 2 diabetes by 13% compared with vitamin D intake<200 IU/day. Individuals with the highest vitamin D status (>25 ng/ml) had a 43% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes (95% confidence interval 24, 57%) compared with those in the lowest group (<14 ng/ml). In post hoc analyses from eight trials among participants with normal glucose tolerance at baseline and in three small underpowered (n=32-62) trials of patients with established type 2 diabetes, there was no effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycemic outcomes. In two trials among patients with baseline glucose intolerance, vitamin D supplementation improved insulin resistance. Vitamin D may play a role in type 2 diabetes; however, to better define the role of vitamin D in the development and progression of type 2 diabetes, high-quality observational studies and RCTs that measure blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and clinically relevant glycemic outcomes are needed.",Mitri J; Muraru MD; Pittas AG,European journal of clinical nutrition,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21731035/,0,1,0,0,0,1
21712404,ESC/EAS Guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias: the Task Force for the management of dyslipidaemias of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS).,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to atherosclerosis of the arterial vessel wall and to thrombosis is the foremost cause of premature mortality and of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in Europe, and is also increasingly common in developing countries.1 In the European Union, the economic cost of CVD represents annually E192 billion1 in direct and indirect healthcare costs. The main clinical entities are coronary artery disease (CAD), ischaemic stroke, and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The causes of these CVDs are multifactorial. Some of these factors relate to lifestyles, such as tobacco smoking, lack of physical activity, and dietary habits, and are thus modifiable. Other risk factors are also modifiable, such as elevated blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidaemias, or non-modifiable, such as age and male gender. These guidelines deal with the management of dyslipidaemias as an essential and integral part of CVD prevention. Prevention and treatment of dyslipidaemias should always be considered within the broader framework of CVD prevention, which is addressed in guidelines of the Joint European Societies’ Task forces on CVD prevention in clinical practice.2 – 5 The latest version of these guidelines was published in 20075; an update will become available in 2012. These Joint ESC/European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) guidelines on the management of dyslipidaemias are complementary to the guidelines on CVD prevention in clinical practice and address not only physicians [e.g. general practitioners (GPs) and cardiologists] interested in CVD prevention, but also specialists from lipid clinics or metabolic units who are dealing with dyslipidaemias that are more difficult to classify and treat.",Reiner Z; Catapano AL; De Backer G; Graham I; Taskinen MR; Wiklund O; Agewall S; Alegria E; Chapman MJ; Durrington P; Erdine S; Halcox J; Hobbs R; Kjekshus J; Filardi PP; Riccardi G; Storey RF; Wood D,European heart journal,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21712404/,0,0,0,0,0,0
21688389,Resveratrol and health--a comprehensive review of human clinical trials.,"In the past decade, the small polyphenol resveratrol has received widespread attention as either a potential therapy or as a preventive agent for numerous diseases. Studies using purified enzymes, cultured cells, and laboratory animals have suggested that resveratrol has anti-aging, anti-carcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant properties that might be relevant to chronic diseases and/or longevity in humans. Although the supporting research in laboratory models is quite substantial, only recently data has emerged to describe the effects of resveratrol supplementation on physiological responses in humans. The limited number of human clinical trials that are available has largely described various aspects of resveratrol's safety and bioavailability, reaching a consensus that it is generally well-tolerated, but have poor bioavailability. Very few published human studies have explored the ability of resveratrol to achieve the physiological benefits that have been observed in laboratory models, although many clinical trials have recently been initiated. This review aims to examine the current state of knowledge on the effects of resveratrol on humans and to utilize this information to develop further guidelines for the implementation of human clinical trials.",Smoliga JM; Baur JA; Hausenblas HA,Molecular nutrition & food research,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21688389/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21629229,Diets and enteral supplements for improving outcomes in chronic kidney disease.,"Protein-energy wasting (PEW), which is manifested by low serum levels of albumin or prealbumin, sarcopenia and weight loss, is one of the strongest predictors of mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although PEW might be engendered by non-nutritional conditions, such as inflammation or other comorbidities, the question of causality does not refute the effectiveness of dietary interventions and nutritional support in improving outcomes in patients with CKD. The literature indicates that PEW can be mitigated or corrected with an appropriate diet and enteral nutritional support that targets dietary protein intake. In-center meals or oral supplements provided during dialysis therapy are feasible and inexpensive interventions that might improve survival and quality of life in patients with CKD. Dietary requirements and enteral nutritional support must also be considered in patients with CKD and diabetes mellitus, in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, renal transplant recipients, and in children with CKD. Adjunctive pharmacological therapies, such as appetite stimulants, anabolic hormones, and antioxidative or anti-inflammatory agents, might augment dietary interventions. Intraperitoneal or intradialytic parenteral nutrition should be considered for patients with PEW whenever enteral interventions are not possible or are ineffective. Controlled trials are needed to better assess the effectiveness of in-center meals and oral supplements.",Kalantar-Zadeh K; Cano NJ; Budde K; Chazot C; Kovesdy CP; Mak RH; Mehrotra R; Raj DS; Sehgal AR; Stenvinkel P; Ikizler TA,Nature reviews.

21626413,Dietary nitrite and nitrate: a review of potential mechanisms of cardiovascular benefits.,"In the last decade, a growing scientific and medical interest has emerged toward cardiovascular effects of dietary nitrite and nitrate; however, many questions concerning their mode of action(s) remain unanswered. In this review, we focus on multiple mechanisms that might account for potential cardiovascular beneficial effects of dietary nitrite and nitrate. Beneficial changes to cardiovascular health from dietary nitrite and nitrate might result from several mechanism(s) including their reduction into nitric oxide, improvement in endothelial function, vascular relaxation, and/or inhibition of the platelet aggregation. From recently obtained evidence, it appears that the longstanding concerns about the toxicity of oral nitrite or nitrate are overstated. Dietary nitrite and nitrate may have cardiovascular protective effects in both healthy individuals and also those with cardiovascular disease conditions. A role for nitrite and nitrate in nitric oxide biosynthesis and/or in improving nitric oxide bioavailability may eventually provide a rationale for using dietary nitrite and nitrate supplementation in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases.",Machha A; Schechter AN,European journal of nutrition,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21626413/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21564442,Thiamine deficiency in diabetes mellitus and the impact of thiamine replacement on glucose metabolism and vascular disease.,"Despite the targeting of traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease, disease burden has not been completely eliminated. Thiamine is an essential cofactor in carbohydrate metabolism and individuals with diabetes are thiamine deficient. The pathophysiology of recognised complications of thiamine deficiency is similar to that underlying atherosclerosis and the metabolic syndrome, namely oxidative stress, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. This review examines the mechanisms by which thiamine deficiency occurs in individuals with diabetes, how this deficiency leads to hyperglycaemic-induced damage, and the effect of thiamine replacement on vascular disease, endothelial function and oxidative stress. Thiamine administration can prevent the formation of harmful by-products of glucose metabolism, reduce oxidative stress and improve endothelial function. The potential benefit of long-term replacement in those with diabetes is not yet known but may reduce cardiovascular risk and angiopathic complications.",Page GL; Laight D; Cummings MH,International journal of clinical practice,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21564442/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21519252,Vitamin D and cardiovascular disease.,"Vitamin D plays a role in many biochemical pathways outside of bone and calcium metabolism, including the cardiovascular system. Prior studies have linked vitamin D deficiency to hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. In this review, we summarize existing studies investigating these associations, specifically those addressing potential mechanisms, epidemiologic associations, and possible benefits of supplementation. Experimental studies have demonstrated that activated vitamin D reduces neurohormonal activation, inhibits inflammation, and suppresses ventricular hypertrophy. Both retrospective and prospective observational studies have related vitamin D levels with cardiometabolic risk factors and outcomes. To date, there have been a small number of randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of vitamin D supplementation on cardiovascular structure and function, but results have been inconclusive or conflicting. Experimental and clinical evidence suggests a link between vitamin D deficiency and cardiovascular disease. Nonetheless, it remains unclear how many of the reported associations are causal. Well designed prospective randomized controlled trials are necessary to further investigate the appropriate role of vitamin D supplementation for cardiovascular risk reduction.",Motiwala SR; Wang TJ,Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21519252/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21507551,Vitamin C as an antioxidant supplement in women's health: a myth in need of urgent burial.,"Epidemiological data suggest that diets rich in antioxidants protect against diseases associated with free radical damage, including cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Early observations also suggested that vitamin supplements with antioxidant properties, like vitamins C and E, could also prevent or ameliorate pre-eclampsia, but most large randomized clinical trials have failed to show any benefit. Vitamin C given orally, even at high doses, does not achieve sustained serum levels that might be required for effective antioxidant activity. This may explain the failure of the numerous clinical trials involving its use in pre-eclampsia, cancers, cardiovascular diseases, etc. Vitamin C supplementation to stave off pre-eclampsia, cancer and other diseases is a 'nutraceutical' industry-driven myth which should be abandoned. We do not dispute a role for oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia, nor the possibility of amelioration of the disease by an anti-oxidant given at the right time and in the correct dosage. We simply wish to make a case that the massive and expensive clinical trials of vitamins C and E should cease until further rigorous scientific research is undertaken.",Talaulikar VS; Manyonda IT,"European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21507551/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21487075,The physiological basis of complementary and alternative medicines for polycystic ovary syndrome.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder that is characterized by chronic hyperandrogenic anovulation leading to symptoms of hirsutism, acne, irregular menses, and infertility. Multiple metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors are associated with PCOS, including insulin resistance, obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, inflammation, and subclinical atherosclerosis. However, current treatments for PCOS are only moderately effective at controlling symptoms and preventing complications. This article describes how the physiological effects of major complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments could reduce the severity of PCOS and its complications. Acupuncture reduces hyperandrogenism and improves menstrual frequency in PCOS. Acupuncture's clinical effects are mediated via activation of somatic afferent nerves innervating the skin and muscle, which, via modulation of the activity in the somatic and autonomic nervous system, may modulate endocrine and metabolic functions in PCOS. Chinese herbal medicines and dietary supplements may also exert beneficial physiological effects in PCOS, but there is minimal evidence that these CAM treatments are safe and effective. Mindfulness has not been investigated in PCOS, but it has been shown to reduce psychological distress and exert positive effects on the central and autonomic nervous systems, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and immune system, leading to reductions in blood pressure, glucose, and inflammation. In conclusion, CAM treatments may have beneficial endocrine, cardiometabolic, and reproductive effects in PCOS. However, most studies of CAM treatments for PCOS are small, nonrandomized, or uncontrolled. Future well-designed studies are needed to further evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and mechanisms of CAM treatments for PCOS.",Raja-Khan N; Stener-Victorin E; Wu X; Legro RS,American journal of physiology.

21478748,Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and postmenopausal women.,"Levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) are known to decline with age. In an era of increasing use of supplements to better life, the benefits of DHEA in the aging female population are controversial. The goal of this article is to critically review published studies to determine if there is a role for DHEA supplementation in postmenopausal women. Daily administration of oral DHEA achieves serum concentrations similar to those of women in their 20s. Several observational studies have shown that lower DHEA levels are associated with increased cardiovascular risk in women; however, interventional trials show no improvement in atherosclerosis or cardiovascular risk factors, and a lowering of HDL cholesterol levels. DHEA supplementation modestly increases bone mineral density in conjunction with adjuvant therapies and improves cognition in those with mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment, but does not affect cognition in unimpaired women. Use of intravaginal DHEA, but not oral DHEA, alleviates vaginal atrophy and improves sexual function in postmenopausal women. On the basis of current evidence, there is no role for oral DHEA supplementation in healthy, postmenopausal women. Where benefits have been shown, long-term studies are needed to confirm these benefits and verify the safety profile of DHEA.",Goel RM; Cappola AR,"Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity",2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21478748/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21436602,Pharmacology in health foods: improvement of vascular endothelial function by French maritime pine bark extract (Flavangenol).,"Flavangenol is the French maritime pine bark extract (PBE). It consists of a concentrate of pine bark constituents such as catechin, taxifolin, and proanthocyanidins. Recent studies have shown that PBE has a strong antioxidant effect and exerts ameliorative effects on cardiovascular, skin, cognitive, and menstrual disorders, as well as in the context of other diseases and disease processes such as diabetes and inflammation. We have also obtained evidence that Flavangenol suppresses nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation and the subsequent various NF-κB-induced gene expressions such as those of adhesion molecules and endothelin-1 in cultured vascular endothelial cells and that the antihypertensive effect of Flavangenol on deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertensive rats is attributable to both its antioxidative property-related protective effects against endothelial dysfunction and the endothelium-dependent vasorelaxant effect, which is mediated by endothelial nitric oxide synthase activation. Furthermore, Flavangenol showed a renoprotective effect on ischemia/reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury in rats. These findings suggest that Flavangenol supplementation may be a promising candidate for the improvement of endothelial dysfunction and the prophylactic treatment of vascular diseases.",Ohkita M; Kiso Y; Matsumura Y,Journal of pharmacological sciences,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21436602/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21433011,"The allenic carotenoid fucoxanthin, a novel marine nutraceutical from brown seaweeds.","Obesity and type 2 diabetes are pathologies with rapidly growing prevalence throughout the world. A few molecular targets offer the most hope for anti-obesity and anti-diabetic therapeutics. One of the keys to success will be the induction of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) and the regulation of cytokine secretions from both abdominal adipose cells and macrophage cells infiltrated into adipose tissue. Anti-obesity and anti-diabetic effects of fucoxanthin, a characteristic carotenoid found in brown seaweeds, have been reported. Nutrigenomic studies reveal that fucoxanthin induces UCP1 in abdominal WAT mitochondria, leading to the oxidation of fatty acids and heat production in WAT. Fucoxanthin improves insulin resistance and decreases blood glucose levels through the regulation of cytokine secretions from WAT. The key structure of carotenoids for the expression of anti-obesity effect is suggested to be the carotenoid end of the polyene chromophore, which contains an allenic bond and two hydroxyl groups.",Miyashita K; Nishikawa S; Beppu F; Tsukui T; Abe M; Hosokawa M,Journal of the science of food and agriculture,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21433011/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The presence of vitamin D receptors (VDRs) in the cells of the immune system and the fact that several of these cells produce the vitamin D hormone suggested that vitamin D could have immunoregulatory properties, and now potent immunomodulatory activities on dendritic cells, Th1 and Th17 cells, as well as B cells have been confirmed. Serum levels of vitamin D have been found to be significantly lower in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, undifferentiated connective tissue disease, and type-1 diabetes mellitus than in the healthy population. In addition, it was also found that lower levels of vitamin D were associated with higher disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis.

21415774,Vitamin D: a d-lightful solution for health.,"Throughout evolution, sunlight-produced vitamin D in the skin has been critically important for health. Vitamin D, known as the sunshine vitamin, is actually a hormone. Once it is produced in the skin or ingested from the diet, it is converted sequentially in the liver and kidneys to its biologically active form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. This hormone interacts with its receptor in the small intestine to increase the efficiency of intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption for the maintenance of the skeleton throughout life. Vitamin D deficiency during the first few years of life results in a flattened pelvis, making it difficult for childbirth. Vitamin D deficiency causes osteopenia and osteoporosis, increasing risk of fracture. Essentially, every tissue and cell in the body has a vitamin D receptor. Therefore, vitamin D deficiency has been linked to increased risk for preeclampsia, requiring a cesarean section for birthing, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, types I and II diabetes, heart disease, dementia, deadly cancers, and infectious diseases. Therefore, sensible sun exposure along with vitamin D supplementation of at least 2000 IU/d for adults and 1000 IU/d for children is essential to maximize their health.",Holick MF,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21415774/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21399917,Studies on the safety of creatine supplementation.,"Doubtful allegations of adverse effects of creatine supplementation have been released through the press media and through scientific publications. In the present review we have tried to separate the wheat from the chaff by looking for the experimental evidence of any such claims. Anecdotal reports from athletes have appeared on muscle cramp and gastrointestinal complaints during creatine supplementation, but the incidence of these is limited and not necessarily linked to creatine itself. Despite several unproved allegations, liver (enzymes, urea) and kidneys (glomerular filtration urea and albumin excretion rates) show no change in functionality in healthy subjects supplemented with creatine, even during several months, in both young and older populations. The potential effects (production of heterocyclic amines) of mutagenicity and carcinogenicity induced by creatine supplementation have been claimed by a French Sanitary Agency (AFSSA), which might put consumers at risk. Even if there is a slight increase (within the normal range) of urinary methylamine and formaldehyde excretion after a heavy load of creatine (20 g/day) this is without effect on kidney function. The search for the excretion of heterocyclic amines remains a future task to definitively exclude the unproved allegation made by some national agencies. We advise that high-dose (>3-5 g/day) creatine supplementation should not be used by individuals with pre-existing renal disease or those with a potential risk for renal dysfunction (diabetes, hypertension, reduced glomerular filtration rate). A pre-supplementation investigation of kidney function might be considered for reasons of safety, but in normal healthy subjects appears unnecessary.",Kim HJ; Kim CK; Carpentier A; Poortmans JR,Amino acids,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21399917/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21342411,Emerging role of thiamine therapy for prevention and treatment of early-stage diabetic nephropathy.,"Thiamine supplementation may prevent and reverse early-stage diabetic nephropathy. This probably occurs by correcting diabetes-linked increased clearance of thiamine, maintaining activity and expression of thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent enzymes that help counter the adverse effects of high glucose concentrations-particularly transketolase. Evidence from experimental and clinical studies suggests that metabolism and clearance of thiamine is disturbed in diabetes leading to tissue-specific thiamine deficiency in the kidney and other sites of development of vascular complications. Thiamine supplementation prevented the development of early-stage nephropathy in diabetic rats and reversed increased urinary albumin excretion in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria in two recent clinical trials. The thiamine monophosphate prodrug, Benfotiamine, whilst preventing early-stage development of diabetic nephropathy experimentally, has failed to produce similar clinical effect. The probable explanations for this are discussed. Further definitive trials for prevention of progression of early-stage diabetic nephropathy by thiamine are now required.",Rabbani N; Thornalley PJ,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21342411/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21324803,[Cod liver oil. A natural Vitamin D for preserving health].,"Vitamin D deficiency is pandemic in industrialized countries due to life-style changes. Recent studies suggest that besides bone-metabolism, vitamin D plays a central role in basic cell function like multiplication, differentiation and metabolism. This may explain that low vitamin D levels represent a risk factor for several apparently different diseases such as infective, autoimmune, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, as well as diabetes, osteoporosis and cancer. Accumulating evidences suggest that an adequate intake of vitamin D may significantly decrease prevalence and clinical outcome of these diseases. Estimated reduction of the economic burden might reach about 10 percent through normalizing vitamin D levels for these diseases. However, high doses of vitamin D monotherapy needs precaution for potential adverse effects and it should be substituted with the recommended doses of vitamin D in combination with synergistic vitamin A and omega 3 fatty acids, such as cod liver oil.",Fehér J; Kovács I; Corrado BG,Orvosi hetilap,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21324803/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21298562,Nutritional supplements and their effect on glucose control.,"Type 2 diabetes is a growing health concern. The use of nutritional supplements by patients with type 2 diabetes is estimated at somewhere between 8% to 49%. The objective of this review was to search the scientific literature for advances in the treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes with nutritional supplements. Twelve databases were searched with a focus on extracting studies published in the past 3 years. The following nutritional supplements were identified as potentially beneficial for type 2 diabetes treatment or prevention: vitamins C and E, α-lipoic acid, melatonin, red mold, emodin from Aloe vera and Rheum officinale, astragalus, and cassia cinnamon.

21252652,Impact of n-3 fatty acids on endothelial function: results from human interventions studies.,"Dysfunction of the endothelium plays an integral role in atherogenesis. This review summarizes recent findings on the effects of marine [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)] and plant [alpha-linolenic acids (ALA)] n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on endothelial function in healthy individuals and in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors or manifest CVD. We identified 33 intervention trials investigating the effects of n-3 PUFA on fasting and/or postprandial endothelial function. In healthy individuals regular supplementation of EPA/DHA or ALA shows inconsistent results on endothelial function, whereas markers of endothelial function seem to be improved in overweight dyslipidaemic patients and type 2 diabetics. Conflicting results are observed in CVD patients. Reasons for discrepancies between the study results include the health status and age of participants, duration of supplementation, dose and fatty acid composition of the administered n-3 PUFAs as well as methods used to assess endothelial function. In individuals with CVD risk factors including overweight, dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes n-3 PUFAs may improve endothelial function. However, the evidence for a clinical efficacy is not strong enough to make final recommendations with respect to a specific dose and the duration of supplementation.",Egert S; Stehle P,Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21252652/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21198720,Effects of vitamin E supplementation on glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes: systematic review of randomized controlled trials.,"Lowering haemoglobin A(₁c) (HbA(₁c)) has clearly been shown to reduce microvascular complications of diabetes and possibly macrovascular disease and vitamin E has been suggested as a possibly useful intervention. Our aim is to evaluate the effect of vitamin E supplementation on glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes. Clinical studies of vitamin E were identified from computerized searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBM reviews and the Cochrane Library up until November 2008. Historical searches of reference lists of relevant articles were also undertaken. To be included in our review, a study had to be: (i) a randomized controlled trial comparing vitamin E monopreparation against placebo or no treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes, (ii) lasting at least 8 weeks, and (iii) reporting glycated haemoglobin or HbA(₁c). There was no language restriction. Study selection, data extraction and study quality assessment were performed by three reviewers with disagreement resolved by discussion. Treatment effect was estimated with the mean difference in the changes of HbA(₁c) from baseline to final assessment between the vitamin E and the control groups. Nine trials involving 418 patients were included in this review. Vitamin E supplementation did not improve glycaemic control in the full set of type 2 diabetes patients. It was effective only in a subgroup of patients with inadequate glycaemic control at baseline (HbA(₁c) ≥ 8%) and in those whose baseline serum vitamin E levels were below normal ranges. The pooled mean difference in the changes of HbA(₁c) was -0.58% (95% CI -0.83% to -0.34%; P < 0.00001) which was the same for both subgroups of patients. The evidence suggests no beneficial effect of vitamin E supplementation in improving glycaemic control in unselected patients with type 2 diabetes. However, HbA(₁c) may decrease with vitamin E supplementation in patients with inadequate glycaemic control or low serum levels of vitamin E. This shows the importance of targeting therapy. Due to the limitations of the available evidence, further studies are warranted. Also, the safety and long-term benefit of such supplements remain to be determined before its clinical benefit can be established unequivocably.",Suksomboon N; Poolsup N; Sinprasert S,Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21198720/,0,1,0,1,0,0
21196324,Obesity in pregnancy: problems and potential solutions.,"Recent years have witnessed an increase in the prevalence of maternal obesity during pregnancy in the United States and worldwide. Obese women have increased risks for gestational problems, such as diabetes, hypertension, and pre-eclampsia. Further, gestational obesity can adversely impact fetal growth and result in macrosomia, congenital abnormalities, and even fetal death. Measures must be taken to reduce maternal adiposity, as even a modest weight loss during pregnancy is beneficial for the health of mothers and fetus. Calorie restriction and moderate exercise are proven safe methods of stopping weight gain and/or inducing white-fat loss in these subjects. Additionally, therapeutic drugs that activate the AMP-activated protein kinase signaling pathway may be effective in ameliorating pathological conditions in obese patients. Finally, dietary supplementation with L-arginine or its effective precursor (L-citrulline) may be beneficial for managing overweight or obese gestating women by reducing white-fat accretion. Because of ethical concerns over human studies, animal models (e.g., sheep, pigs, baboons, rats, and mice) are warranted to test novel hypotheses with enormous biological significance and clinical applications.",McKnight JR; Satterfield MC; Li X; Gao H; Wang J; Li D; Wu G,Frontiers in bioscience (Elite edition),2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21196324/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21196250,Brown adipose tissue growth and development: significance and nutritional regulation.,"The last decade has witnessed a profound resurgence in brown adipose tissue (BAT) research. The need for such a dramatic increase stems from the ever-growing trend toward global obesity. Indeed, it is currently estimated that rates of obesity in developed countries such as the United States exceed 35% of the population (1). The higher incidence of obesity is associated with increased prevalence of the metabolic syndrome including diabetes, hypertension, and coronary heart disease, among others (1, 2). BAT holds great promise in combating obesity given its unprecedented metabolic capacity. Leading the way has been recent studies, which conclusively demonstrate significant quantities of functional BAT in adult humans (3-7). These findings have been complimented by elegant studies elucidating the developmental origin of the brown adipocyte and the transcriptional regulation involved in its differentiation. This review will attempt to meld the wealth of new information regarding BAT development with established literature to provide an up to date synopsis of what is known and thus a framework for future research directions.",Satterfield MC; Wu G,Frontiers in bioscience (Landmark edition),2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21196250/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21184648,Micronutrients at the interface between inflammation and infection--ascorbic acid and calciferol. Part 2: calciferol and the significance of nutrient supplements.,"As explained in the first part of the article, vitamins and trace elements influence various metabolic functions that are directly related to immune function. In this context, secosteroid vitamin D has met with growing interest. The discussion has focused on whether and, if so, to what extent, vitamin D might contribute to the prevention and possibly the treatment of infections and autoimmune diseases. We know, for instance, that immune cells are capable of synthesizing calcitriol from its precursor calcidiol, whereby the former enhances the synthesis of antibacterial peptides by macrophages while simultaneously inhibiting the (auto)immune response mediated by T helper cells (Th1). Numerous observational studies support the hypothesis that a vitamin D deficit increases the risk of autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis; however, there are few reliable interventional studies to date. In general, immune status represents a sensitive indicator of micronutrient supply. Conversely, the activity of the immune system has an effect on the status of and requirements for nutrients.",Ströhle A; Wolters M; Hahn A,Inflammation & allergy drug targets,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21184648/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21128894,Herbal medicines and nutraceuticals for diabetic vascular complications: mechanisms of action and bioactive phytochemicals.,"Diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases throughout the world. The majority of its complications arise from vascular-related inflammation apparently initiated by endothelial cell injury. One cause of this injury has been attributed to hyperglycaemia-induced reactive oxygen species. Consequently, current drug developmental strategy has targeted specific inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways for the prevention of diabetic vascular complications. Herbal medicines have traditionally been used for the treatment of diabetes and its complications. In fact, current pre-clinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that many of them exhibit potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties, and have also identified the active phytochemicals responsible for their activities. The present review summarises the latest research on the molecular mechanisms of diabetic vascular complications, and evaluates the level of scientific evidence for common herbal medicines and their bioactive phytochemicals. These agents have been shown to be effective through various mechanisms, particularly the NF-κB signalling pathways. Overall, herbal medicines and nutraceuticals, as well as their bioactive components, which exhibit anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties, provide a promising approach for the prevention and treatment of diabetic complications.",Omar EA; Kam A; Alqahtani A; Li KM; Razmovski-Naumovski V; Nammi S; Chan K; Roufogalis BD; Li GQ,Current pharmaceutical design,2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21128894/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21122657,Role of dietary supplements in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a review.,"Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains a major source of morbidity and mortality. As the epidemic of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension continues to grow among young adults, the population at risk for atherosclerotic CHD is ever increasing. More than a century of laboratory and human findings link cholesterol levels with a propensity to develop atherosclerosis. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is the major atherogenic lipoprotein, and numerous clinical trials have shown the efficacy of lowering LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) for reducing CHD risk. New trial data have resulted in LDL-C goals being lowered over time and expansion of the population of patients that are candidates for LDL-lowering therapy to decrease their lifetime risk of CHD. Although statins are relatively safe and well tolerated, there are still significant numbers of patients who cannot tolerate them and many others who only require mild LDL-C reduction and prefer nonprescription alternatives to statin therapy. A number of dietary supplements and functional foods have been suggested to reduce LDL-C levels, but only a few have withstood the rigors of randomized controlled trials. Here we review the evidence in support of dietary supplements and their LDL-C-lowering effects. We also review supplements that, after initial excitement about their purported effect, were not found to lower LDL-C significantly.",Nijjar PS; Burke FM; Bloesch A; Rader DJ,Journal of clinical lipidology,2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21122657/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21118613,Vitamin D and cardiometabolic health: a review of the evidence.,"The cardiometabolic syndrome (MetS) is a clustering of related metabolic abnormalities including abdominal adiposity, insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and increased inflammatory and thrombotic markers, which is linked to increased risk of type 2 diabetes, CVD and overall mortality. Several cross-sectional and prospective studies have shown an association between low vitamin D status, as indicated by concentrations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (s25(OH)D), and increased prevalence of the MetS and individual CVD risk factors. These epidemiological observations are supported by mechanistic studies but experimental data are limited. The available data from intervention studies are largely confounded as most vitamin D supplementation trials were mainly carried out to explore the role of Ca in CVD and include Ca in the treatment arms. Inadequate consideration of seasonal effects on s25(OH)D concentrations is also a common design flaw in most studies. Further complications arise from shared risk factors such as adiposity and ageing, which predispose individuals to exhibit both a more pronounced risk profile and relatively lower s25(OH)D concentrations. In conclusion, while epidemiological associations are promising and a rationale for low vitamin D status as a potentially modifiable risk factor for CVD is supported by mechanistic data, suitable experimental data from appropriately designed trials are just beginning to emerge. As yet, this body of literature is too immature to draw firm conclusions on the role of vitamin D in CVD prevention. Carefully controlled vitamin D trials in well-described population groups using intervention doses that are titrated against target s25(OH)D concentrations could yield potentially valuable outcomes that may have a positive impact on CVD risk modification.",Muldowney S; Kiely M,Nutrition research reviews,2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21118613/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21094028,Selenium status and cardiometabolic health: state of the evidence.,"Use of selenium enriched foods, supplements and fertilizers has increased markedly in recent years in the US and other Western countries because of the perception that the anti-oxidant properties of selenium could potentially reduce the risk of cancer and other chronic diseases. However, concern has been raised recently about possible adverse cardiometabolic effects of high selenium exposure, including an increased risk of diabetes and hyperlipidemia with high selenium intake. Hence, from a public health perspective, the relationship between selenium status and cardiometabolic health should be clarified in order to help guide consumers in their choices of nutritional supplements and enriched food products. Additional experimental evidence is needed to provide new insights into the role of selenium and of specific selenoproteins in human biology, especially to clarify the underlying mechanisms linking selenium to chronic disease endpoints. Further epidemiological studies and randomized clinical trials across populations with different selenium status should be conducted to determine the causal effect of selenium on cardiovascular disease and risk factors. Nevertheless, at the present time the widespread use of selenium supplements or other strategies that artificially increase selenium status above the level required for optimal selenoprotein activity is not justified and should not be encouraged.",Stranges S; Navas-Acien A; Rayman MP; Guallar E,"Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21094028/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21040500,Can dietary fructans lower serum glucose?,"Convincing evidence indicates that the consumption of inulin-type fructans, inulin, and oligofructose has beneficial effects on blood glucose changes in animal models, although data in humans have been considered equivocal. As such, a systematic review of available literature on humans was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of dietary inulin-type fructans on serum glucose. Thirteen eligible randomized controlled trials (RCT), published from 1984 to 2009, were identified using a comprehensive search strategy involving the PubMed, Medline, and Cochrane Library databases. Exclusion criteria, such as the absence of a control group, lack of information on the quantity of inulin-type fructans used, and lack of glucose values at outcome, were established. Upon review, only four of the 13 trials (31%) showed a decrease in serum glucose concentration and only one of these was statistically significant. The remaining nine trials showed no significant changes in serum glucose concentration. Based on the present systematic review, it does not appear that inulin-type fructans have a significant lowering effect on serum glucose in humans. More RCT are needed to determine whether inulin-type fructans, inulin, and oligofructose have beneficial effects on blood glucose in humans.",Bonsu NK; Johnson CS; McLeod KM,Journal of diabetes,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21040500/,0,1,0,1,0,0

There is emerging evidence that vitamin D deficiency may be a risk modifying factor for many chronic diseases, including osteomalacia, rickets, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, heart disease, type 1 diabetes, and cancer. Heightened susceptibility to these diseases may originate in early life during the development of tissue structure and function. It is suspected that biologic mechanisms can ""memorize"" the metabolic effects of early nutritional environment through fetal and neonatal imprinting.

20964549,Vitamin D: a hormone for all seasons.,"Vitamin D is principally obtained from skin through the action of ultraviolet B irradiation on 7-dehydrocholesterol. It is further metabolized to 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the major circulating vitamin D compound, and then to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the hormonal form. The major function of vitamin D compounds is to enhance active absorption of calcium (and phosphate) from the gut, ensuring that bone does not need to be resorbed to maintain blood calcium concentrations despite obligatory urinary losses. Vitamin D compounds have direct effects to enhance bone and muscle function. Based on good evidence, target levels for 25-hydroxyvitamin D in blood are at least 50 nmol/l and there may be a case for higher targets of 75-80 nmol/l. Adequate calcium intakes help to reduce vitamin D degradation. Vitamin D and calcium together reduce the risk of falls and fractures in older people. There are vitamin D receptors in most nucleated cells and preliminary evidence that adequate vitamin D levels may be important in reducing the incidence of, or mortality from, some cancers, and in reducing autoimmune disease. Adequate vitamin D may also allow for a normal innate immune response to pathogens, improve cardiovascular function and mortality, and reduce type 2 diabetes.

In vitro studies have demonstrated that cinnamon may act as an insulin mimetic, to potentiate insulin activity or to stimulate cellular glucose metabolism. Furthermore, animal studies have demonstrated strong hypoglycemic properties. However, there are only very few well-controlled clinical studies, a fact that limits the conclusions that can be made about the potential health benefits of cinnamon for free-living humans.

Results from epidemiological studies suggest a beneficial skeletal effect in Asian women consuming typical Asian diets, but clinical trials are conflictive regarding the effects of phytoestrogens on bone mineral density and bone turnover markers in premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Much of the controversy lies in differences in study design, reporting of results, participants' age and menopausal status, and type and dose of phytoestrogen used. Although western women will likely continue to incorporate soy foods and soy supplements into their diets with the increased availability of these products, published data are inconsistent and do not support soy's protective effect against bone loss.

20870007,Applications and bioefficacy of the functional food supplement fermented papaya preparation.,"Fermented papaya preparation (FPP) (a product of yeast fermentation of Carica papaya Linn) is a food supplement. Studies in chronic and degenerative disease conditions (such as thalassemia, cirrhosis, diabetes and aging) and performance sports show that FPP favorably modulates immunological, hematological, inflammatory, vascular and oxidative stress damage parameters. Neuroprotective potential evaluated in an Alzheimer's disease cell model showed that the toxicity of the β-amyloid can be significantly modulated by FPP. Oxidative stress trigger apoptotic pathways such as the c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38-mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) are preferentially activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress resulting in cell differentiation and apoptosis. FPP modulated the H₂O₂-induced ERK, Akt and p38 activation with the reduction of p38 phosphorylation induced by H₂O₂. FPP reduces the extent of the H₂O₂-induced DNA damage, an outcome corroborated by similar effects obtained in the benzo[a]pyrene treated cells. No genotoxic effect was observed in experiments with FPP exposed to HepG2 cells nor was FPP toxic to the PC12 cells. Oxidative stress-induced cell damage and inflammation are implicated in a variety of cancers, diabetes, arthritis, cardiovascular dysfunctions, neurodegenerative disorders (such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease), exercise physiology (including performance sports) and aging. These conditions could potentially benefit from functional nutraceutical/food supplements (as illustrated here with fermented papaya preparation) exhibiting anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunostimulatory (at the level of the mucus membrane) and induction of antioxidant enzymes.",Aruoma OI; Hayashi Y; Marotta F; Mantello P; Rachmilewitz E; Montagnier L,Toxicology,2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20870007/,1,0,0,0,0,0
20852295,Flavanols and cardiovascular disease prevention.,"Diet is a major lifestyle factor in the primary and secondary prevention of numerous chronic diseases, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and diabetes. Epidemiological studies suggest that the beneficial cardiovascular health effects of diets rich in fruits and vegetables are in part mediated by their flavonoid content, with particular benefits provided by one member of this family, the flavanols. This concept is supported by findings from small-scale intervention studies with surrogate endpoints including endothelium-dependent vasodilation, blood pressure, platelet function, and glucose tolerance. Mechanistically, short-term effects on endothelium-dependent vasodilation following the consumption of flavanol-rich foods, as well as purified flavanols, have been linked to an increased nitric oxide bioactivity in healthy humans, and those with increased cardiovascular risk. The critical biological target(s) for flavanols have yet to be identified and the extent to which these acute results are important in the context of long-term human health is unknown. While flavanols represent a promising class of food components with respect to their ability to lower cardiovascular risk the flavanol-rich foods used in many trials have been poorly defined with respect to their flavanol content and flavanol-isomer profile; several studies have lacked appropriate controls, and the long-term randomized controlled intervention trials with flavanol-rich foods are missing. Thus, while the literature regarding flavanols and vascular health is encouraging, more in-depth and well-controlled clinical and experimental studies are needed to better define the potential protective vascular effects of these nutrients and their therapeutic value in cardiovascular medicine.",Heiss C; Keen CL; Kelm M,European heart journal,2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20852295/,1,0,0,0,0,0

A review of the role of vitamin D in health and disease, the impact of photoprotection and skin type on vitamin D levels, and recommendations for adequate vitamin D intake is provided to aid clinicians in counseling patients regarding these issues. Review of the literature indicates that adequate vitamin D intake is associated with decreased risk of falls and bone fractures in the elderly, breast and gastrointestinal cancer risk, cardiovascular disease, and possibly all cause mortality, diabetes, and multiple sclerosis. While skin type does affect vitamin D levels, regular use of sunscreen is not associated with vitamin D insufficiency.

20795941,"Vitamin D: evolutionary, physiological and health perspectives.","Vitamin D, the sunshine vitamin, has been important not only for the evolution of a healthy calcified vertebrate skeleton but it also evolved into a hormone that has a wide diversity of biologic effects. During exposure to sunlight the ultraviolet B radiation converts 7-dehydrocholesterol to previtamin D(3) which in turn rapidly isomerizes to vitamin D(3). Once formed, vitamin D(3) is metabolized in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) and in the kidneys to its active form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3). 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) interacts with its vitamin D receptor in calcium regulating tissues to regulate calcium metabolism and bone health. It is now recognized that most cells in the body have a vitamin D receptor and they also have the capability of producing 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) which in turn is capable of regulating a wide variety of genes that have important functions in regulating cell growth, modulating immune function and cardiovascular health. Epidemiologic evidence and prospective studies have linked vitamin D deficiency with increased risk of many chronic diseases including autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular disease, deadly cancers, type II diabetes and infectious diseases. Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency have been defined as a 25-hydroxyvitamin D <20 ng/ml and 21-29 ng/ml respectively. For every 100 IU of vitamin D ingested the blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the measure vitamin D status, increases by 1 ng/ml. It is estimated that children need at least 400-1000 IU of vitamin D a day while teenagers and adults need at least 2000 IU of vitamin D a day to satisfy their body's vitamin D requirement. It is estimated that 1 billion people worldwide are vitamin D deficient or insufficient.

20795939,Vitamin D biology in heart failure: molecular mechanisms and systematic review.,"Vitamin D has recently been suggested as an important mediator of blood pressure and cardiovascular disease, including heart failure. In patient with heart failure, low vitamin D levels are associated with adverse outcome and correlate with established clinical correlates and biomarkers. Many precursor states of heart failure, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, and diabetes are more prevalent in subjects with low vitamin D levels. Recent experimental data have provided clues how vitamin D might exert cardioprotective effects. The steroid hormone vitamin D regulates gene expression of many genes that play a prominent role in the progression of heart failure, such as cytokines and hormones. Specifically, vitamin D is a negative regulator of the hormone renin, the pivotal hormone of the renin-angiotensin system. Mechanistic insights were gained by studying mice deficient for the vitamin D receptor, which develop hypertension and adverse cardiac remodeling mediated via the renin-angiotensin system. Furthermore, vitamin D receptor is expressed in the heart and regulated under pro-hypertrophic stimuli and vitamin D as receptor has been associated with the expression of other hypertrophic genes such as natriuretic peptides. So, epidemiological data and mechanistic studies have provided strong support for a potentially cardioprotective effect of vitamin D. It remains unclear if vitamin D supplementation is beneficial in preventing heart failure or if it could be a therapeutic addendum in the treatment of heart failure. This review summarizes current knowledge on vitamin D and its biology in heart failure.",Meems LM; van der Harst P; van Gilst WH; de Boer RA,Current drug targets,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20795939/,0,1,0,0,0,0

Accumulating evidence from experimental, clinical, and epidemiological studies suggests that vitamin D may also be associated with several indices of vascular function, including the development and progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. These findings may provide at least a partial explanation for several recent epidemiologic studies implicating low vitamin D status in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. However, many questions still remain. Only a handful of studies are currently available, and the results of these studies have generally been mixed. Additionally, it is unknown whether findings differ across varied subpopulations, including minority subgroups in the United States, younger adults, and those residing in areas with varying amounts of regular sunlight. Furthermore, the exact mechanism by which vitamin D may influence the atherosclerotic disease process has not yet been completely elucidated. In addition, if vitamin D is important in the etiology of atherosclerosis, it is unclear at what stage(s) in the atherosclerotic disease process vitamin D may exert its effects. Large-scale, well-conducted, placebo controlled clinical trials testing the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in delaying, slowing, or reverting the atherosclerotic disease process have not yet been conducted. Until the results of these studies are available, we believe it is premature to recommend vitamin D as a therapeutic option in atherosclerosis.",Brewer LC; Michos ED; Reis JP,Current drug targets,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20795937/,1,0,0,0,0,0
20795936,Vitamin D insufficiency and diabetes risks.,"Diabetes is an increasing epidemic; hyperglycemia results from lack of insulin or inadequate insulin secretion following increases in insulin resistance. Huge costs are placed upon sufferers and health providers, aggravated as serious and disabling complications develop. Thus, measures to reduce the diabetic burden are public health concerns. Vitamin D, identified ≈100 years ago, promotes calcium absorption and utilization, preventing and curing rickets & osteomalacia. Calcium is necessary for insulin secretion, suggesting vitamin D may contribute to maintaining insulin secretion. Vitamin D, formed in skin in bright sunshine, is scarce in foodstuffs. Data linking hypovitaminosis D to hyperglycemia, type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and metabolic disorders increasing cardiovascular risk [metabolic 'syndrome'] has accumulated over ≈40 years. Many mechanisms are known whereby hypovitaminosis D could be causal, e.g. by increasing insulin resistance, reducing insulin secretion and increasing autoimmune or inflammatory damage to pancreatic islets. Major questions still to be answered are whether increasing vitamin D status to the maximum seen in healthy people would reduce the risk of diabetes, the severity of the disease or of its complications, including cardiovascular disease. These questions urgently require answers. If on-going/ planned RCTs confirm causality, maintenance of adequate vitamin D status at the population level by food-fortification or supplementation would be cost-effective measures likely to reduce the burden and costs of diabetes to individuals and health services. Additionally, vitamin D(2/3) supplementation is cheap but whether some non-hypercalcemia-inducing analogue may prove safer has not yet been addressed at the population level.",Boucher BJ,Current drug targets,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20795936/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Amino acids are capable to directly modulate insulin secretion and/or contribute to the maintenance of β-cell function, resulting in an improvement of insulin release. Animal models of protein malnutrition have provided important insights into the adaptive mechanisms involved in insulin secretion in malnutrition. In this review, we discuss studies focusing on the modulation of insulin secretion by amino acids, specially leucine and taurine, in rodent models of protein malnutrition. Leucine supplementation increases insulin secretion by pancreatic islets in malnourished mice. This effect is at least in part due to increase in the expression of proteins involved in the secretion process, and the activation of the PI3K/PKB/mTOR pathway seems also to contribute. Mice supplemented with taurine have increased insulin content and secretion as well as increased expression of genes essential for β-cell functionality. The knowledge of the mechanisms through which amino acids act on pancreatic β-cells to stimulate insulin secretion is of interest for clinical medicine. It can reveal new targets for the development of drugs toward the treatment of endocrine diseases, in special type 2 diabetes.",de Oliveira CA; Latorraca MQ; de Mello MA; Carneiro EM,Amino acids,2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20711845/,1,0,0,0,0,0
20654584,Delivery of antiinflammatory nutraceuticals by nanoparticles for the prevention and treatment of cancer.,"Extensive research within the last two decades has revealed that most chronic illnesses, including cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, are mediated through chronic inflammation. Thus, suppressing chronic inflammation has the potential to delay, prevent, and even treat various chronic diseases, including cancer. Various nutraceuticals from fruits, vegetables, vitamins, spices, legumes, and traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine have been shown to safely suppress proinflammatory pathways; however, their low bioavailability in vivo limits their use in preventing and treating cancer. We describe here the potential of nanotechnology to fill this gap. Several nutraceuticals, including curcumin, green tea polyphenols, coenzyme Q, quercetin, thymoquinone and others, have been packaged as nanoparticles and proven to be useful in ""nanochemoprevention"" and ""nano-chemotherapy"".",Nair HB; Sung B; Yadav VR; Kannappan R; Chaturvedi MM; Aggarwal BB,Biochemical pharmacology,2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20654584/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Occurrence of both metabolic syndrome and diabetes and their vascular complications share several pathogenetic features including subclinical, low-grade inflammation, altered oxidative/antioxidant status, and persistent platelet activation. Despite the availability of multiple interventions to counteract these metabolic changes, including appropriate diet, regular exercise, weight control and drugs, epidemiological data are witnessing the growing trend of the problem, reflecting both the multifactorial nature of these diseases as well as the scarce compliance of patients to established strategies. Several nutraceuticals used in clinical practice have been shown to target the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome and their complications and to favorably modulate a number of biochemical and clinical endpoints. These compounds include antioxidant vitamins, such as vitamins C and E, flavonoids, vitamin D, conjugated linoleic acid, omega-3 fatty acids, minerals such as chromium and magnesium, alpha-lipoic acid, phytoestrogens, and dietary fibers. Several areas of concern exist regarding the use of dietary supplements and nutraceuticals in this setting, including product standardization, definition of optimal dosing regimen, potential side effects, drug interactions, and need for evidence-based indications.",Davì G; Santilli F; Patrono C,Cardiovascular therapeutics,2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20633024/,1,0,0,0,0,0
20554123,A review of meat protein hydrolysates and hypertension.,"We tested the hypothesis that meat is a source of peptides that are effective at preventing and reducing chronic lifestyle-related diseases (CLSRDs) such as hypertension. This analysis reflects the importance of empowering hypertensive people in quality versus quantity of life issues, and in offering nutritional treatment options rather than medical alternatives. For both hypertensive and normotensive individuals, chemically based medications may have harmful side effects. Functional food rich in antioxidant vitamins, and proteins or biologically active peptides, can lower blood pressure in persons with essential hypertension, possibly by preventing an underlying cause of the condition. Deficiency in consumption of crucial nutrients such as proteins from meat origins, along with abnormalities in carbohydrate and fat metabolism, may underlie the etiology of the clinical course of hypertension. Food derived from meat rich in nutrients may provide physiologically functional peptides, as well as improve digestion, and the metabolism of carbohydrate and fats, thus lowering blood pressure, and normalizing associated biochemical and histopathological changes. Meat was found to have value, because proteolysis of meat muscle generated a substantial number of multi-amino acid peptides that have nutrafunctional roles, and some of which have strong angiotension-converting enzyme inhibitory activity. This also demonstrates that meat proteins might lead to better nutraceutical therapy that minimizes health problems, and might aid in finding the most effective approaches for meeting the needs of all hypertension patients.",Ahhmed AM; Muguruma M,Meat science,2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20554123/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The safety and efficacy of some dietary interventions to modulate risk factors in childhood are documented by an increasing body of evidence. The present review analyzes nutritional and nutraceutical current strategies addressed to modify some risk factors of atherosclerosis in childhood. In particular, studies concerning nutrients such as fibers, omega-3-fatty acids, vitamin D, antioxidants, and calcium have been evaluated. An overall analysis suggests that some nutraceuticals might represent an attractive tool to lower the development of atherosclerotic-related cardiovascular complication in children. Nevertheless, at this moment, due to the methodological weakness that characterizes the majority of the analyzed studies, nutrients or supplements should not be considered as a therapeutic tool potentially usable for clinical purpose in children at risk for cardiovascular disease.",Pignatelli P; Basili S,Cardiovascular therapeutics,2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20553293/,1,0,0,0,0,0

This review investigates current evidence for relationships between selected nutrients - vitamin B complex, antioxidants (vitamin A, C, E and carotenoids), calcium, vitamin D, vitamin K, magnesium, sodium, and potassium - and glucose metabolism. The investigation reveals current evidence is not strong enough for supplementation with minerals and vitamins to be recommended on a large scale for the prevention or management of DM. In order to prevent deficiencies and maintain health, the majority of diabetic individuals should receive daily vitamins and minerals within the ranges of recommended values from consumption of natural food sources and/or fortified foods.

20511061,Vitamin D and diabetes.,"Type 1 (T1D) and type 2 (T2D) diabetes are considered multifactorial diseases in which both genetic predisposition and environmental factors participate in their development. Many cellular, preclinical, and observational studies support a role for vitamin D in the pathogenesis of both types of diabetes including: (1) T1D and T2D patients have a higher incidence of hypovitaminosis D; (2) pancreatic tissue (more specifically the insulin-producing beta-cells) as well as numerous cell types of the immune system express the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and vitamin D-binding protein (DBP); and (3) some allelic variations in genes involved in vitamin D metabolism and VDR are associated with glucose (in)tolerance, insulin secretion, and sensitivity, as well as inflammation. Moreover, pharmacologic doses of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)(2)D), the active form of vitamin D, prevent insulitis and T1D in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice and other models of T1D, possibly by immune modulation as well as by direct effects on beta-cell function. In T2D, vitamin D supplementation can increase insulin sensitivity and decrease inflammation.

Nutritional interventions that incorporate functional foods, such fish oils - in particular n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) - may be a novel strategy to reduce insulin insensitivity, dyslipidemia, hypertension and pro-inflammatory state. The purpose of this article is to examine the impact of fish oil supplementation on blood lipids, glycemic control, blood pressure and inflammation in subjects with T2DM. Overall, the literature suggests that n-3 PUFA supplementation in diet presents many benefits in T2DM management mainly in terms of dyslipidemia; however, the impact of n-3 PUFAs on glucose control, blood pressure, inflammation and oxidations is less definitive.

20485898,Evidence-based non-skeletal actions of vitamin D.,"Vitamin D is a major regulator of mineral homeostasis through its action in the kidney, intestine, bone and parathyroid glands. On these tissues, its active form, calcitriol, acts by binding to a specific nuclear receptor that belongs to the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor family. This receptor, however, has also been identified in several additional human tissues. So, apart from its traditional actions related to calcium, vitamin D and its synthetic analogs are being increasingly recognized for their anti-proliferative, pro-differentiative and immunomodulatory activities. Low levels of vitamin D have been linked to many chronic diseases. Decreased muscle function and increased fall risk in elderly people; prostate, breast and colorectal cancers; diabetes mellitus; and other health problems have been associated to low circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D.

Here we discuss the evidence relating to vitamin D in pregnancy, from preconception to the perinatal period. During pregnancy extra calcium required for fetal skeletal growth is attained by both maternal bone resorption and increased absorption from dietary sources, necessitating increased maternal vitamin D. Many women have low vitamin D status during pregnancy and may require supplementation, although optimal serum levels and intake required to achieve those levels is not yet well defined. Evidence from animal studies, with some supportive human evidence, suggests that fertility may be impaired in mothers with low vitamin D. During pregnancy, maintaining vitamin D and calcium levels may decrease the risks of pre-eclampsia, while gestational diabetes mellitus appears to be more common in those with low vitamin D status, although there is insufficient evidence of causality. The evidence in relation to increased risks of bacterial vaginosis and caesarean section similarly requires confirmation in carefully designed observational and experimental studies. This review outlines the emerging evidence that maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy is important for the health of the mother and offspring across a range of possible health outcomes.",Lewis S; Lucas RM; Halliday J; Ponsonby AL,Molecular nutrition & food research,2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20440696/,1,0,0,0,0,0
20440694,Sunlight robbery: a critique of public health policy on vitamin D in the UK.,"The British Isles have a very cloudy climate and as a result receive fewer hours of clear sunlight than most other industrial regions. The majority of people in these islands have low blood levels of vitamin D [25(OH)D] all year round. Few food products are fortified with vitamin D in the UK and the government does not recommend any vitamin D supplement for most adults in the UK. Diseases associated with vitamin D insufficiency such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes (types 1 and 2) and multiple sclerosis are more frequent in the UK, and particularly in Scotland, than in many other European countries and some, such as multiple sclerosis and diabetes (types 1 and 2), are increasing in incidence. Present knowledge suggests that the risk of some chronic diseases could be reduced if vitamin D intake or sun exposure of the population were increased. Yet policy and public health recommendations of the UK government and its agencies (e.g. the Health Protection Agency, the Food Standards Agency) and of Cancer Research UK have failed to take full account of established and putative benefits of vitamin D and/or sunshine.

Emerging evidence shows that dietary L-arginine supplementation reduces adiposity in genetically obese rats, diet-induced obese rats, finishing pigs, and obese human subjects with Type-2 diabetes mellitus. The mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of L-arginine are likely complex, but ultimately involve altering the balance of energy intake and expenditure in favor of fat loss or reduced growth of white adipose tissue. Recent studies indicate that L-arginine supplementation stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and brown adipose tissue development possibly through the enhanced synthesis of cell-signaling molecules (e.g., nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, polyamines, cGMP, and cAMP) as well as the increased expression of genes that promote whole-body oxidation of energy substrates (e.g., glucose and fatty acids) Thus, L-arginine holds great promise as a safe and cost-effective nutrient to reduce adiposity, increase muscle mass, and improve the metabolic profile in animals and humans.",McKnight JR; Satterfield MC; Jobgen WS; Smith SB; Spencer TE; Meininger CJ; McNeal CJ; Wu G,Amino acids,2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20437186/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Studies that provided chromium to human subjects in documented deficiency states noted improved glucose levels. However, controversy exists as to whether dietary supplementation with chromium should be routinely recommended in subjects without documented deficiencies. Over the recent past, several well-designed clinical trials have provided evidence in favor of and against a beneficial effect of chromium. It appears that across all subject phenotypes (eg, lean and obese, insulin sensitive and insulin resistant), a consistent significant and beneficial effect of chromium may not be observed. Specifically, recent data fail to demonstrate significant improvement in carbohydrate metabolism in individuals with metabolic syndrome, impaired glucose tolerance, or consistently in individuals with type 2 diabetes. However, patient selection may be an important factor in determining clinical response, as it was concluded that a clinical response to chromium (ie, decreased glucose and improved insulin sensitivity) may be more likely in insulin-resistant individuals with type 2 diabetes who have more elevated fasting glucose and hemoglobin A(1c) levels.",Wang ZQ; Cefalu WT,Current diabetes reports,2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20425574/,1,0,0,0,0,0
20420526,Targeting inflammation-induced obesity and metabolic diseases by curcumin and other nutraceuticals.,"Extensive research within the past two decades has revealed that obesity, a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, cancer, and other chronic diseases, is a proinflammatory disease. Several spices have been shown to exhibit activity against obesity through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Among them, curcumin, a yellow pigment derived from the spice turmeric (an essential component of curry powder), has been investigated most extensively as a treatment for obesity and obesity-related metabolic diseases. Curcumin directly interacts with adipocytes, pancreatic cells, hepatic stellate cells, macrophages, and muscle cells. There, it suppresses the proinflammatory transcription factors nuclear factor-kappa B, signal transducer and activators of transcription-3, and Wnt/beta-catenin, and it activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma and Nrf2 cell-signaling pathways, thus leading to the downregulation of adipokines, including tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-6, resistin, leptin, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and the upregulation of adiponectin and other gene products. These curcumin-induced alterations reverse insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and other symptoms linked to obesity.

20413867,Targets for the prevention of dementia.,"The prevalence of dementia is expected to increase dramatically over the upcoming decades due to the aging population. Since treatment is still short of a cure, preventative strategies are of the utmost importance. Stimulating activity (cognitive, physical, and social), vascular risk factors, and diet may be important in preventative strategies. Dementia risk may be modified by participation in stimulating activities. One study suggested that the cognitive, physical, and social components of activity were of equal importance to cognitive outcomes. However, while exercise interventions appear to benefit global cognition, the benefits from cognitive training appear to be domain specific. People with vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity) appear to be at higher risk for dementia than those without in observational and clinical trials. Controlled trials suggest that vascular risk management via some pharmaceutical interventions may benefit cognition, though results are inconsistent. Finally, people who adhere to a Mediterranean diet or who have high intake of antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids have reduced likelihood of dementia in observational studies. However, supplementation in controlled trials has not generally proved successful at improving cognitive outcomes. A single supplement may be insufficient to prevent dementia; it may be that the overall diet is more important. Future large randomized controlled studies should examine whether interventions can reduce the risk of dementia and whether combining cognitive, physical, and social activity, vascular risk reduction, and dietary interventions might have additive or multiplicative effects.",Middleton LE; Yaffe K,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20413867/,1,0,0,0,0,0

20368372,The role of milk- and soy-based protein in support of muscle protein synthesis and muscle protein accretion in young and elderly persons.,"The balance between muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and muscle protein breakdown (MPB) is dependent on protein consumption and the accompanying hyperaminoacidemia, which stimulates a marked rise in MPS and mild suppression of MPB. In the fasting state, however, MPS declines sharply and MPB is increased slightly. Ultimately, the balance between MPS and MPB determines the net rate of muscle growth. Accretion of new muscle mass beyond that of normal growth can occur following periods of intense resistance exercise. Such muscle accretion is an often sought-after goal of athletes. There needs to be, however, an increased appreciation of the role that preservation of muscle can play in offsetting morbidities associated with the sarcopenia of aging, such as type 2 diabetes and declines in metabolic rate that can lead to fat mass accumulation followed by the onset or progression of obesity. Emerging evidence shows that consumption of different types of proteins can have different stimulatory effects on the amplitude and possibly duration that MPS is elevated after feeding; this may be particularly significant after resistance exercise. This effect may be due to differences in the fundamental amino acid composition of the protein (i.e., its amino acid score) and its rate of digestion. Milk proteins, specifically casein and whey, are the highest quality proteins and are quite different in terms of their rates of digestion and absorption. New data suggest that whey protein is better able to support MPS than is soy protein, a finding that may explain the greater ability of whey protein to support greater net muscle mass gains with resistance exercise. This review focuses on evidence showing the differences in responses of MPS, and ultimately muscle protein accretion, to consumption of milk- and soy-based supplemental protein sources in humans.",Phillips SM; Tang JE; Moore DR,Journal of the American College of Nutrition,2009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20368372/,1,0,0,0,0,0
20359262,Assessment and management of pressure ulcers in the elderly: current strategies.,"Pressure ulcers (pressure sores) continue to be a common health problem, particularly among the physically limited or bedridden elderly. The problem exists within the entire health framework, including hospitals, clinics, long-term care facilities and private homes. For many elderly patients, pressure ulcers may become chronic for no apparent reason and remain so for prolonged periods, even for the remainder of the patient's lifetime. A large number of grade 3 and 4 pressure ulcers become chronic wounds, and the afflicted patient may even die from an ulcer complication (sepsis or osteomyelitis). The presence of a pressure ulcer constitutes a geriatric syndrome consisting of multifactorial pathological conditions. The accumulated effects of impairment due to immobility, nutritional deficiency and chronic diseases involving multiple systems predispose the aging skin of the elderly person to increasing vulnerability. The assessment and management of a pressure ulcer requires a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach in order to understand the patient with the ulcer. Factors to consider include the patient's underlying pathologies (such as obstructive lung disease or peripheral vascular disease), severity of his or her primary illness (such as an infection or hip fracture), co-morbidities (such as dementia or diabetes mellitus), functional state (activities of daily living), nutritional status (swallowing difficulties), and degree of social and emotional support; focusing on just the wound itself is not enough. An understanding of the physiological and pathological processes of aging skin throws light on the aetiology and pathogenesis of the development of pressure ulcers in the elderly. Each health discipline (nursing staff, aides, physician, dietitian, occupational and physical therapists, and social worker) has its own role to play in the assessment and management of the patient with a pressure ulcer. The goals of treating a pressure ulcer include avoiding any preventable contributing circumstances, such as immobilization after a hip fracture or acute infection. Once a pressure ulcer has developed, however, the goal is to heal it by optimizing regional blood flow (by use of a stent or vascular bypass surgery), managing underlying illnesses (such as diabetes, hypothyroidism or congestive heart failure) and providing adequate caloric and protein intake (whether through use of dietary supplements by mouth or by use of tube feeding). If the ulcer has become chronic, the ultimate goal changes from healing the wound to controlling symptoms (such as foul odour, pain, discomfort and infection) and preventing complications, thereby contributing to the patient's overall well-being; providing support for the patient's family is also important. Recent advances in wound dressings allow for greater control of symptoms and prevention of complications, and have also enabled the affected patient to be integrated more readily into the family setting and in the community at large. Ethical and end-of-life issues must also be addressed soon after the wound has become chronic. This article discusses the pathogenesis of pressure ulcer development in the elderly in relation to concomitant diseases, risk factor assessment and the management of such ulcers.",Jaul E,Drugs & aging,2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20359262/,1,0,0,0,0,0
20346934,"The clinical significance of betaine, an osmolyte with a key role in methyl group metabolism.","Betaine is an essential osmolyte and source of methyl groups and comes from either the diet or by the oxidation of choline. Its metabolism methylates homocysteine to methionine, also producing N,N-dimethylglycine. Betaine insufficiency is associated with the metabolic syndrome, lipid disorders and diabetes, and may have a role in vascular and other diseases. Betaine is important in development, from the pre-implantation embryo to infancy. Betaine supplementation improves animal and poultry health, but the effect of long-term supplementation on humans is not known, though reports that it improves athletic performance will stimulate further studies. Subsets of the population that may benefit from betaine supplementation could be identified by the laboratory, in particular those who excessively lose betaine through the urine. Plasma betaine is highly individual, in women typically 20-60 micromol/L and in men 25-75 micromol/L. Plasma dimethylglycine is typically <10 micromol/L. Urine betaine excretion is minimal, even following a large betaine dose. It is constant, highly individual and normally <35 mmol/mole creatinine.

English-language studies in MEDLINE (inception to 4 November 2009) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (fourth quarter of 2009). 11 reviewers screened citations to identify longitudinal cohort studies that reported associations between vitamin D status and cardiometabolic outcomes, including randomized trials of vitamin D supplementation. 5 independent reviewers extracted data about study conduct, participant characteristics, outcomes, and quality. Differences were resolved by consensus. 13 observational studies (14 cohorts) and 18 trials were eligible. Three of 6 analyses (from 4 different cohorts) reported a lower incident diabetes risk in the highest versus the lowest vitamin D status groups. Eight trials found no effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycemia or incident diabetes. In meta-analysis of 3 cohorts, lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was associated with incident hypertension (relative risk, 1.8 [95% CI, 1.3 to 2.4]). In meta-analyses of 10 trials, supplementation nonsignificantly reduced systolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference, -1.9 mm Hg [CI, -4.2 to 0.4 mm Hg]) and did not affect diastolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference, -0.1 mm Hg [CI, -0.7 to 0.5 mm Hg]). Lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was associated with incident cardiovascular disease in 5 of 7 analyses (6 cohorts). Four trials found no effect of supplementation on cardiovascular outcomes. Studies included primarily white participants. Observational studies were heterogeneous. Several trials reported post hoc analyses. The association between vitamin D status and cardiometabolic outcomes is uncertain. Trials showed no clinically significant effect of vitamin D supplementation at the dosages given.

20089791,"Laboratory, epidemiological, and human intervention studies show that tea (Camellia sinensis) may be useful in the prevention of obesity.","Tea (Camellia sinensis, Theaceae) and tea polyphenols have been studied for the prevention of chronic diseases, including obesity. Obesity currently affects >20% of adults in the United States and is a risk factor for chronic diseases such as type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Given this increasing public health concern, the use of dietary agents for the prevention of obesity would be of tremendous benefit. Whereas many laboratory studies have demonstrated the potential efficacy of green or black tea for the prevention of obesity, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The results of human intervention studies are mixed and the role of caffeine has not been clearly established. Finally, there is emerging evidence that high doses of tea polyphenols may have adverse side effects. Given that the results of scientific studies on dietary components, including tea polyphenols, are often translated into dietary supplements, understanding the potential toxicities of the tea polyphenols is critical to understanding their potential usefulness in preventing obesity. In this review, we will critically evaluate the evidence for the prevention of obesity by tea, discuss the relevance of proposed mechanisms in light of tea polyphenol bioavailability, and review the reports concerning the toxic effects of high doses of tea polyphenols and the implication that this has for the potential use of tea for the prevention of obesity.

Management of cobalamin deficiency with cobalamin injections is well codified at present, but new routes of cobalamin administration (oral and nasal) are being studied, especially oral cobalamin therapy for food-cobalamin malabsorption. The objective of this review is to evaluate the efficacy of oral cobalamin treatment in elderly patients. To reach this objective, PubMed data were systematically searched for English and French articles published from January 1990 to July 2008. Data from our research group on cobalamin deficiency (Groupe d'Etude des CAREnce vitamine B12 - CARE B12) were also analyzed. Three prospective randomized studies, a systematic review by the Cochrane group and five prospective cohort studies were found and provide evidence that oral cobalamin treatment may adequately treat cobalamin deficiency. The efficacy was particularly highlighted when looking at the marked improvement in serum vitamin B12 levels and hematological parameters, for example hemoglobin level, mean erythrocyte cell volume and reticulocyte count. The effect of oral cobalamin treatment in patients presenting with severe neurological manifestations has not yet been adequately documented. Oral cobalamin treatment avoids the discomfort, inconvenience and cost of monthly injections.

In simple terms food provides energy for sustenance, while therapeutic products are taken for managing ailments (1). However, over the years roles of foods have changed considerably. Now, food no longer is seen as simply the provider of energy, but it is expected to provide physiological benefits for good health and productive lifestyles. Well managed combination of foods and therapeutic products plays important role in the prevention and treatment of many diseases, including a number of chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, obesity. Most often food is combined with medicine to enhance the benefits of medicine - an additive and/or synergistic effect: food-therapeutic product synergism. At the most basic level, food is a complex mixture of chemicals with many functional groups; hence, they not only confer positive effects, but may also make negative contributions.

Vitamin D deficiency in adults may cause osteomalacia, increase fracture risk in osteoporosis, induce cardiovascular diseases, diabetes type 1 and 2, multiple sclerosis, Lesniowski-Crohn disease, and cancer, including colon, breast, and prostate cancer. Possible causes of vitamin D deficiency in a healthy population include decreased cutaneous synthesis and an inadequate intake of vitamin D, both in food and in supplements. Vitamin D deficiency level (25(OH) D. <20 ng/mL), is fairly widespread, being found in a substantial percentage of healthy subjects around the world, regardless of race, gender and age. Daily vitamin D dose, as determined by the Food and Nutrition Board in 1997, is now rather insufficient, the biggest problem being associated with maximal vitamin D levels (50 μg/day) in actually available food supplements. Nowadays, it is recommended that adults need a minimum of 800-1,000 U/day when their exposure to the sun is inadequate (in Poland from October to April). This dosage should be provided to all subjects who avoid sunlight, as well as to those aged over 65 because of their slower skin synthesis of vitamin D and for its proven anti-fracture and anti-fall effects.",Marcinowska-Suchowierska E; Walicka M; Tałałaj M; Horst-Sikorska W; Ignaszak-Szczepaniak M; Sewerynek E,Endokrynologia Polska,2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22127635/,0,0,0,0,0,0

21520708,Genetic engineering to enhance crop-based phytonutrients (nutraceuticals) to alleviate diet-related diseases.,"Nutrition studies have provided unambiguous evidence that a number of human health maladies including chronic coronary artery, hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis, cancer and age- and lifestyle-related diseases are associated with the diet. Several favorable and a few deleterious natural dietary ingredients have been identified that predispose human populations to various genetic and epigenetic based disorders. Media dissemination of this information has greatly raised public awareness of the beneficial effects due to increased consumption of fruit, vegetables and whole grain cereals-foods rich in phytonutrients, protein and fiber. However, the presence of intrinsically low levels of the beneficial phytonutrients in the available genotypes of crop plants is not always at par with the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for different phytonutrients (nutraceuticals). Molecular engineering of crop plants has offered a number of tools to markedly enhance intracellular concentrations of some of the beneficial nutrients, levels that, in some cases, are closer to the RDA threshold. This review brings together literature on various strategies utilized for bioengineering both major and minor crops to increase the levels of desirable phytonutrients while also decreasing the concentrations of deleterious metabolites. Some of these include increases in: protein level in potato; lysine in corn and rice; methionine in alfalfa; carotenoids (beta-carotene, phytoene, lycopene, zeaxanthin and lutein) in rice, potato, canola, tomato; choline in tomato; folates in rice, corn, tomato and lettuce; vitamin C in corn and lettuce; polyphenolics such as flavonol, isoflavone, resveratrol, chlorogenic acid and other flavonoids in tomato; anthocyanin levels in tomato and potato; alpha-tocopherol in soybean, oil seed, lettuce and potato; iron and zinc in transgenic rice. Also, molecular engineering has succeeded in considerably reducing the levels of the offending protein glutelin in rice, offering proof of concept and a new beginning for the development of super-low glutelin cereals for celiac disease patients.",Mattoo AK; Shukla V; Fatima T; Handa AK; Yachha SK,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21520708/,1,0,0,0,0,0
19998523,"Antioxidant properties of an endogenous thiol: Alpha-lipoic acid, useful in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.","In the past few years, a growing interest has been given to the possible antioxidant functions of a natural acid, synthesized in human tissues: alpha-lipoic acid (ALA). Both the oxidized (disulfide) and reduced (dithiol: dihydrolipoic acid, DHLA) forms of ALA show antioxidant properties. ALA administered in the diet accumulates in tissues, and a substantial part is converted to DHLA via a lipoamide dehydrogenase. Commercial ALA is usually a racemic mixture of the R and S forms. Chemical studies have indicated that ALA scavenges hydroxyl radicals, hypochlorous acid, and singlet oxygen. ALA exerts antioxidant effects in biological systems not only through direct ROS quenching but also via transition metal chelation. ALA has been shown to possess a number of beneficial effects both in the prevention and treatment of diabetes in experimental conditions. ALA presents beneficial effects in the management of symptomatic diabetic neuropathy and has been used in this context in Germany for more than 30 years. In cardiovascular disease, dietary supplementation with ALA has been successfully employed in a variety of in vivo models: ischemia-reperfusion, heart failure, and hypertension. More mechanistic and human in vivo studies are needed to determine whether optimizing the dietary intake of ALA can help to decrease cardiovascular diseases.

The aim of this review was to examine the results of randomized controlled clinical trials of cinnamon and evaluate the therapeutic potential amongst patients with diabetes and insulin-resistant patients, particularly the ability to reduce blood glucose levels and inhibit protein glycation. A systematic electronic literature search using the medical subject headings 'cinnamon' and 'blood glucose' was carried out to include randomized, placebo-controlled in vivo clinical trials using Cinnamomum verum or Cinnamomum cassia conducted between January 2003 and July 2008. Five type 2 diabetic and three non-diabetic studies (total N = 311) were eligible. Two of the diabetic studies illustrated significant fasting blood glucose (FBG) reductions of 18-29% and 10.3% (p < 0.05), supported by one non-diabetic trial reporting an 8.4% FBG reduction (p < 0.01) vs. placebo, and another illustrating significant reductions in glucose response using oral glucose tolerance tests (p < 0.05). Three diabetic studies reported no significant results. Whilst definitive conclusions cannot be drawn regarding the use of cinnamon as an antidiabetic therapy, it does possess antihyperglycaemic properties and potential to reduce postprandial blood glucose levels.

The review synthesizes the available evidence for the role of vitamin D in skeletal health as well as its novel roles in medical conditions such as muscle function, falls, immunity, glucose homeostasis, and cardiovascular diseases. The article reviews methods for assessing vitamin D status and suggests strategies to restore vitamin D status in patients requiring enteral or parenteral nutrition who are at particularly high risk of hypovitaminosis D. Screening for hypovitaminosis D with plasma total 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be a routine part of the care of the patient requiring enteral or parenteral nutrition. Restoration of optimal vitamin D status with high-dose supplemental vitamin D is required in most cases, whereas exposure to sunlight or an ultraviolet B radiation-emitting device is most effective in patients with severe malabsorption or those requiring long-term parenteral therapy.

However, there is still epidemic vitamin D insufficiency especially among individuals living at high latitudes or with dark skin. Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) are considered the best biomarker of vitamin D nutritional status. Appropriate sunshine exposure or oral supplementation is necessary to maintain sufficient vitamin D status, which is generally accepted as serum 25(OH)D>75 nmol/l. Immunoassays, especially RIA, have been primarily used to measure serum 25(OH)D while liquid chromatography-MS (LC-MS) is considered the 'gold standard'. There is significant disparity among the immunoassays, and all immunoassays have considerable bias compared with LC-MS methods. Because of the variations among the results from these different assays, it is necessary that assay-specific reference ranges be established or standardisation of the assays take place. The present review focuses on ecological, case-control, and cohort studies that investigated the role of vitamin D in health and disease.

As far as infants are concerned, milk oligosaccharides are supposed to be the optimal 'dietary fibre'. The supplementation of infant formula with prebiotic oligosaccharides is still discussed. However, recent studies provide a large amount of information, allowing a new discussion on this topic. Most recent findings are linked to the involvement of dietary fibre in occurrence or prevention of obesity. The multiple mechanisms appear more clearly than earlier. This finding will soon allow appropriate counselling for young mothers at risk of obesity and/or postpartum retention weight, gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. Another area which benefits from recent research is the use of prebiotics in formula. Pregnancy is a critical period during which many physiologic changes occurred and is associated with several gut disorders and metabolic diseases. Dietary fibre may be helpful in the prevention and management of these diseases. Lactation and pregnancy are two phases during which food consumption of the mother can interact with the physiology of the baby.

The underlying mechanisms of insulin resistance are still unclear and may involve pathological changes in multiple tissues. Mitochondrial dysfunction, including mitochondrial loss and over-production of oxidants, has been suggested to be involved in the development of insulin resistance. Increasing evidence suggests that targeting mitochondria to protect mitochondrial function as a unique measure, i.e. mitochondrial medicine, could prevent and ameliorate various diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. In this review, we have summarized recent progress in pharmaceutical and nutritional studies of drugs and nutrients to targeting mitochondria by stimulating mitochondrial metabolism (biogenesis and degradation) to improve mitochondrial function and decrease oxidative stress for preventing and ameliorating insulin resistance. We have focused on nutrients from natural sources to stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis in cellular systems and in animal models. The in vitro and in vivo studies, especially our own work on the effects and mechanisms of mitochondrial targeting nutrients or their combinations, may help us to understand the importance and mechanisms of mitochondrial biogenesis in insulin resistance, and provide hope for developing mitochondria-targeting agents for preventing and treating insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes and obesity.",Liu J; Shen W; Zhao B; Wang Y; Wertz K; Weber P; Zhang P,Advanced drug delivery reviews,2009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19716392/,1,0,0,0,0,0
19664690,Alpha-lipoic acid as a dietary supplement: molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential.,"Alpha-lipoic acid (LA) has become a common ingredient in multivitamin formulas, anti-aging supplements, and even pet food. It is well-defined as a therapy for preventing diabetic polyneuropathies, and scavenges free radicals, chelates metals, and restores intracellular glutathione levels which otherwise decline with age. How do the biochemical properties of LA relate to its biological effects? Herein, we review the molecular mechanisms of LA discovered using cell and animal models, and the effects of LA on human subjects. Though LA has long been touted as an antioxidant, it has also been shown to improve glucose and ascorbate handling, increase eNOS activity, activate Phase II detoxification via the transcription factor Nrf2, and lower expression of MMP-9 and VCAM-1 through repression of NF-kappa B. LA and its reduced form, dihydrolipoic acid, may use their chemical properties as a redox couple to alter protein conformations by forming mixed disulfides. Beneficial effects are achieved with low micromolar levels of LA, suggesting that some of its therapeutic potential extends beyond the strict definition of an antioxidant. Current trials are investigating whether these beneficial properties of LA make it an appropriate treatment not just for diabetes, but also for the prevention of vascular disease, hypertension, and inflammation.",Shay KP; Moreau RF; Smith EJ; Smith AR; Hagen TM,Biochimica et biophysica acta,2009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19664690/,1,0,0,0,0,0

An increasing body of scientific evidence indicates that acute sleep loss induces insulin resistance and glucose intolerance profiles similar to those of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Experimentally, cassia cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia) supplementation facilitates glucose disposal in healthy humans, which may be achieved by enhancing (1) insulin sensitivity via increased phosphorylation of signaling proteins and (2) insulin-sensitive glucose transporter 4-mediated glucose uptake into muscle cells. Because peripheral insulin resistance is primarily a consequence of reduced muscle insulin sensitivity, C. cassia and C. cassia extracts may attenuate insulin resistance and glucose intolerance observed following sleep loss.",Jitomir J; Willoughby DS,Journal of medicinal food,2009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19627193/,1,0,0,0,0,0
19627041,[Omega-3 fatty acids: the science and the beliefs].,"The importance of Omega-3 fatty acids intake from dietary supplements or from food sources (mainly fish) has recently become ""common knowledge"" in the mass media as well as in popular science magazines and advertisements. Therefore, the authors wish to review the updated evidence-based literature regarding the relationship between Omega-3 fatty acid intake and morbidity and its preventative effects in cardiovascular, bone, kidney autoimmune, GI tract diseases, CNS and mental diseases, cancer, diabetes, asthma, ophthalmological health, organ transplants and child and maternal health. Recommendations regarding optimal intake of these fatty acids throughout the lifecycle by various health authorities are cited. The conclusion presents the authors' recommendations for optimal Omega-3 intake in Israel: Recommendations for the general population is to consume at least two weekly portions of fatty fish. For patients with hypertriglyceridemia, dietary supplements containing fish oil, in addition to the above diet, can be considered to be part of the complete medical treatment and follow-up. Limiting fish consumption in risk group populations, such as pregnant women, will also be considered.",Ginsberg A; Stahl Z; Leventhal A,Harefuah,2009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19627041/,1,0,0,0,0,1
19595386,Carnosine and its possible roles in nutrition and health.,"The dipeptide carnosine has been observed to exert antiaging activity at cellular and whole animal levels. This review discusses the possible mechanisms by which carnosine may exert antiaging action and considers whether the dipeptide could be beneficial to humans. Carnosine's possible biological activities include scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), chelator of zinc and copper ions, and antiglycating and anticross-linking activities. Carnosine's ability to react with deleterious aldehydes such as malondialdehyde, methylglyoxal, hydroxynonenal, and acetaldehyde may also contribute to its protective functions. Physiologically carnosine may help to suppress some secondary complications of diabetes, and the deleterious consequences of ischemic-reperfusion injury, most likely due to antioxidation and carbonyl-scavenging functions. Other, and much more speculative, possible functions of carnosine considered include transglutaminase inhibition, stimulation of proteolysis mediated via effects on proteasome activity or induction of protease and stress-protein gene expression, upregulation of corticosteroid synthesis, stimulation of protein repair, and effects on ADP-ribose metabolism associated with sirtuin and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) activities. Evidence for carnosine's possible protective action against secondary diabetic complications, neurodegeneration, cancer, and other age-related pathologies is briefly discussed.",Hipkiss AR,Advances in food and nutrition research,2009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19595386/,1,0,0,0,0,0
19555519,Vitamin D: emerging new roles in insulin sensitivity.,"The growing incidence of prediabetes and clinical type 2 diabetes, in part characterised by insulin resistance, is a critical health problem with consequent devastating personal and health-care costs. Vitamin D status, assessed by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, is inversely associated with diabetes in epidemiological studies. Several clinical intervention studies also support that vitamin D, or its active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D), improves insulin sensitivity, even in subjects with glucose metabolism parameters classified within normal ranges. The mechanisms proposed which may underlie this effect include potential relationships with improvements in lean mass, regulation of insulin release, altered insulin receptor expression and specific effects on insulin action. These actions may be mediated by systemic or local production of 1,25(OH)2D or by suppression of parathyroid hormone, which may function to negatively affect insulin sensitivity. Thus, substantial evidence supports a relationship between vitamin D status and insulin sensitivity; however, the underlying mechanisms require further exploration.",Teegarden D; Donkin SS,Nutrition research reviews,2009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19555519/,1,0,0,0,0,0
19519395,Recent studies on neural tube defects in embryos of diabetic pregnancy: an overview.,"Maternal diabetes develops in 2-6% of total pregnancies, depending on geographical and ethnic background. About 10% of fetuses from diabetic pregnancy display congenital malformations in various organ systems including cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary and neurological systems, among which the neural tube defects (NTDs) such as anencephaly, holoprosencephaly and syntelencephaly were more frequently demonstrated. Recent studies by the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group show that tight glycemic control early in pregnancy decreases the progression of a number of diabetic complications. However, it appears that the pre-existing tissue damage cannot be reversed even after normoglycemic levels are achieved during pregnancy. In recent years, considerable efforts have been made to investigate the etiology of birth defects among infants of diabetic mothers. It has been shown that diabetes-induced fetal abnormalities are accompanied by some metabolic disturbances including elevated superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, reduced levels of myoinositol and arachidonic acid and inhibition of the pentose phosphate shunt pathway. Moreover, the frequency of fetal malformations in diabetic pregnancy has been reported to be markedly reduced by dietary supplements of antioxidants such as vitamin E, vitamin C and butylated hy- droxytoluene, suggesting that oxidative stress is involved in the etiology of fetal dysmorphogenesis. Furthermore, several experimental studies have shown that NTDs in embryos of diabetic mice are associated with altered expression of genes, which control development of the neural tube. In this review, recent findings of possible molecular mechanisms which cause morphological changes during neural tube development in embryos of diabetic pregnancy are discussed.",Dheen ST; Tay SS; Boran J; Ting LW; Kumar SD; Fu J; Ling EA,Current medicinal chemistry,2009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19519395/,1,0,0,0,0,0

In experimental work, administration of inositol, arachidonic acid and several antioxidative compounds, as well as folic acid, to the embryo, has proven to attenuate the teratogenic effects of a diabetic environment. Future therapeutic efforts may include supplementation with antioxidants or micronutrients, such as folic acid, to the pregnant diabetic woman, although exact compounds and doses need to be determined.",Wentzel P,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",2009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19476472/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Phytoestrogens are structurally similar to estradiol and mimic its effects. Soy and phytoestrogens receive increasing attention due to the health benefits associated with their consumption. Here we review the data collected on the effects of soy and phytoestrogens on glucose and lipid metabolism and their possible mechanisms of action. Overall, there is a suggestive body of evidence that soy and dietary phytoestrogens favorably alter glycemic control, improve weight and fat loss, lower triglycerides, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and total cholesterol. However, these results must be interpreted with care, and additional evidence is needed before a firm conclusion can be drawn. In particular, since not all activities related to soy can be assigned to the estrogenic-like activity, further studies are needed to identify firstly which soy constituent(s) improve metabolic parameters when ingested and secondly, which are the mechanisms whereby dietary soy improves metabolic-related conditions like obesity and diabetes.

19403630,The effect of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation on urine protein excretion and kidney function: meta-analysis of clinical trials.,"Chronic kidney disease is a major worldwide problem. Although epidemiologic and experimental studies suggest that n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 LCPUFA) supplementation may prevent or slow the progression of kidney disease, evidence from clinical trials is inconsistent. The objective was to combine evidence from controlled clinical trials to assess the effect of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation on the change in urine protein excretion (UPE) and on glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We performed a meta-analysis of clinical trials that tested the effect of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation on UPE, a marker of kidney damage, and on GFR, a marker of kidney function. A random-effects model was used to pool SD effect size (Cohen's d) across studies. Seventeen trials with 626 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Most trials focused on patients with a single underlying diagnosis: IgA nephropathy (n = 5), diabetes (n = 7), or lupus nephritis (n = 1). The dose of n-3 LCPUFAs ranged from 0.7 to 5.1 g/d, and the median follow-up was 9 mo. In the pooled analysis, there was a greater reduction in UPE in the n-3 LCPUFA group than in the control group: Cohen's d for all trials was -0.19 (95% CI: -0.34, -0.04; P = 0.01). In a patient with 1 g UPE/d , this corresponds to a reduction of 190 mg/d. Effects on GFR were reported in 12 trials. The decline in GFR was slower in the n-3 LCPUFA group than in the control group, but this effect was not significant (0.11; 95% CI: -0.07, 0.29; P = 0.24). In our meta-analysis, use of n-3 LCPUFA supplements reduced UPE but not the decline in GFR. However, small numbers of participants in trials, different methods of assessing proteinuria and GFR, and inconsistent data reporting limit the strength of these conclusions. Large, high-quality trials with clinical outcomes are warranted.",Miller ER; Juraschek SP; Appel LJ; Madala M; Anderson CA; Bleys J; Guallar E,The American journal of clinical nutrition,2009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19403630/,0,0,0,1,0,1

Treatment for chronic inflammatory disorders has not been solved, and there is an urgent need to find new and safe anti-inflammatory compounds. Flavonoids belong to a group of natural substances occurring normally in the diet that exhibit a variety of beneficial effects on health. The anti-inflammatory properties of flavonoids have been studied recently, in order to establish and characterize their potential utility as therapeutic agents in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Several mechanisms of action have been proposed to explain in vivo flavonoid anti-inflammatory actions, such as antioxidant activity, inhibition of eicosanoid generating enzymes or the modulation of the production of proinflammatory molecules. Recent studies have also shown that some flavonoids are modulators of proinflammatory gene expression, thus leading to the attenuation of the inflammatory response. However, much work remains to be done in order to achieve definitive conclusions about their potential usefulness. This review summarizes the known mechanisms involved in the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids and the implications of these effects on the protection against cancer and cardiovascular disease.",García-Lafuente A; Guillamón E; Villares A; Rostagno MA; Martínez JA,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

19373082,Androgen abuse in the community.,"To provide information of the current prevalence of illicit use of androgens by individuals of the community. Prevalence of abuse of androgens in individuals of the general population has reached alarming dimensions. Use of androgens is no longer limited to competitive sports, but has spread to leisure and fitness sports, bodybuilding, and nonathletes motivated to increase muscular mass and physical attractiveness. Alarming studies from Germany demonstrated that members of the healthcare systems provide illegal androgens to 48.1% of abusers visiting fitness centers. The new trend to combine androgens with growth hormone, insulin, and insulinotropic milk protein-fortified drinks may potentiate health risks of androgen abuse. The use of androgens has changed from being a problem restricted to sports to one of public health concern. The potential health hazards of androgen abuse are underestimated in the medical community, which unfortunately contributes to illegal distribution of androgens. Both the adverse effects of current androgen abuse especially in young men as well as the chronic toxicity from past long-term abuse of now middle-aged men has to be considered as a growing public health problem. In the future, an increasing prevalence of androgen misuse in combination with other growth-promoting hormones and insulinotropic milk protein products has to be expected, which may have further promoting effects on the prevalence of chronic western diseases.",Melnik BC,"Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity",2009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19373082/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is a well-established benefit of their intake. Dietary supplementation may also benefit patients with dyslipidaemia, atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, obesity, inflammatory diseases, neurological/ neuropsychiatric disorders and eye diseases. Consumption of omega-3 FAs during pregnancy reduces the risk of premature birth and improves intellectual development of the fetus. Fish, fish oils and some vegetable oils are rich sources of omega-3 FAs. According to the UK Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition guidelines (2004), a healthy adult should consume a minimum of two portions of fish a week to obtain the health benefit.

19301095,"Amino acids: metabolism, functions, and nutrition.","Recent years have witnessed the discovery that amino acids (AA) are not only cell signaling molecules but are also regulators of gene expression and the protein phosphorylation cascade. Additionally, AA are key precursors for syntheses of hormones and low-molecular weight nitrogenous substances with each having enormous biological importance. Physiological concentrations of AA and their metabolites (e.g., nitric oxide, polyamines, glutathione, taurine, thyroid hormones, and serotonin) are required for the functions. However, elevated levels of AA and their products (e.g., ammonia, homocysteine, and asymmetric dimethylarginine) are pathogenic factors for neurological disorders, oxidative stress, and cardiovascular disease. Thus, an optimal balance among AA in the diet and circulation is crucial for whole body homeostasis. There is growing recognition that besides their role as building blocks of proteins and polypeptides, some AA regulate key metabolic pathways that are necessary for maintenance, growth, reproduction, and immunity. They are called functional AA, which include arginine, cysteine, glutamine, leucine, proline, and tryptophan. Dietary supplementation with one or a mixture of these AA may be beneficial for (1) ameliorating health problems at various stages of the life cycle (e.g., fetal growth restriction, neonatal morbidity and mortality, weaning-associated intestinal dysfunction and wasting syndrome, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, the metabolic syndrome, and infertility); (2) optimizing efficiency of metabolic transformations to enhance muscle growth, milk production, egg and meat quality and athletic performance, while preventing excess fat deposition and reducing adiposity.

19268496,Estimated benefit of increased vitamin D status in reducing the economic burden of disease in western Europe.,"Vitamin D has important benefits in reducing the risk of many conditions and diseases. Those diseases for which the benefits are well supported and that have large economic effects include many types of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, several bacterial and viral infections, and autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Europeans generally have low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels owing to the high latitudes, largely indoor living, low natural dietary sources of vitamin D such as cold-water ocean fish, and lack of effective vitamin D fortification of food in most countries. Vitamin D dose-disease response relations were estimated from observational studies and randomized controlled trials. The reduction in direct plus indirect economic burden of disease was based on increasing the mean serum 25(OH)D level to 40 ng/mL, which could be achieved by a daily intake of 2000-3000 IU of vitamin D. For 2007, the reduction is estimated at euro187,000 million/year. The estimated cost of 2000-3000 IU of vitamin D3/day along with ancillary costs such as education and testing might be about euro10,000 million/year. Sources of vitamin D could include a combination of food fortification, supplements, and natural and artificial UVB irradiation, if properly acquired. Additional randomized controlled trials are warranted to evaluate the benefits and risks of vitamin D supplementation.

19190532,The vitamin D connection to pediatric infections and immune function.,"Over the past 20 y, a resurgence in vitamin D deficiency and nutritional rickets has been reported throughout the world, including the United States. Inadequate serum vitamin D concentrations have also been associated with complications from other health problems, including tuberculosis, cancer (prostate, breast, and colon), multiple sclerosis, and diabetes. These findings support the concept of vitamin D possessing important pleiotropic actions outside of calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. In children, an association of nutritional rickets with respiratory compromise has long been recognized. Recent epidemiologic studies clearly demonstrate the link between vitamin D deficiency and the increased incidence of respiratory infections. Further research has also elucidated the contribution of vitamin D in the host defense response to infection. However, the mechanism(s) by which vitamin D levels contribute to pediatric infections and immune function has yet to be determined. This knowledge is particularly relevant and timely, because infants and children seem more susceptible to viral rather than bacterial infections in the face of vitamin D deficiency.

19165292,[Influence of dietary intake on plasma biomarkers of oxidative stress in humans].,"Oxidative stress is related to an imbalance between the production of reactive species and the antioxidant defenses. In essence, oxidative stress has been defined as a disturbance in the pro-oxidant/antioxidant balance, leading to potential damage. It has been suggested that oxidative stress is involved in the etiology of several chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer and neurodegenerative processes. The antioxidant defenses include nonenzymatic (especially dietary antioxidants) and antioxidant enzymes. Vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals (polyphenols and carotenoids) are among the major dietary antioxidants. The assessment of oxidative stress status though specific biomarkers has acquired great importance. The major biomarkers include the products of the attack of free radicals and reactive species to various substrates: lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. Measurement of antioxidant capacity may also involve the assessment of specific oxidative stress biomarkers. Most of the studies that have examined the association between diet and oxidative stress consider the effects of antioxidant supplements (vitamins and minerals), drinks and foods with bioactive compounds or dietary patterns on oxidative stress biomarkers. Some of these studies have demonstrated beneficial results on oxidative stress markers.

Seven new trials in 2007 and 2008 were identified from 206 abstracts to give a total of 24 trials between 1966 and 2008 involving 1533 participants that could be pooled. The mean omega-3 PUFAs dose and duration of treatment in the new trials was 2.4 g/day and 24 weeks, respectively. Compared with placebo, omega-3 PUFAs supplementation decreased triglycerides by 7% (mean -0.17 mmol/l, 24 trials, 1530 participants), fibrinogen by 10% (mean -0.96 micromol/l, three trials, 159 participants), ADP platelet aggregation to ADP by 22% (mean -10.30%, two trials, 64 participants) and to collagen by 21% (mean -10.55%, two trials, 64 participants), with an LDL-cholesterol increase of 3% (mean 0.08 mmol/l, 21 trials, 1104 participants). None of the following risk factors appeared to be beneficially influenced: HDL-cholesterol, LDL particle size, glycemia, insulinemia, inflammatory biomarkers, blood pressure. However for some of these risk factors (such as inflammatory biomarkers) the number of trial patients was small Higher doses of omega-3 PUFAs (>or=2 g/day) may have greater triglyceride lowering effects. This systematic review and meta-analysis confirms the triglyceride lowering effects of omega-3 PUFAs, demonstrates potential dose-response effects and shows improvements in thrombogenesis. Omega-3 PUFAs raise LDL levels without concomitant changes in lipid particle size. Changes seen in conventional risk factors are insufficient to explain the cardiovascular disease risk reductions suggested to occur with omega-3 PUFAs.",Hartweg J; Farmer AJ; Holman RR; Neil A,Current opinion in lipidology,2009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19133409/,0,1,0,1,0,0
19118493,Role of TNF-alpha in vascular dysfunction.,"Healthy vascular function is primarily regulated by several factors including EDRF (endothelium-dependent relaxing factor), EDCF (endothelium-dependent contracting factor) and EDHF (endothelium-dependent hyperpolarizing factor). Vascular dysfunction or injury induced by aging, smoking, inflammation, trauma, hyperlipidaemia and hyperglycaemia are among a myriad of risk factors that may contribute to the pathogenesis of many cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes and atherosclerosis. However, the exact mechanisms underlying the impaired vascular activity remain unresolved and there is no current scientific consensus. Accumulating evidence suggests that the inflammatory cytokine TNF (tumour necrosis factor)-alpha plays a pivotal role in the disruption of macrovascular and microvascular circulation both in vivo and in vitro. AGEs (advanced glycation end-products)/RAGE (receptor for AGEs), LOX-1 [lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1) and NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB) signalling play key roles in TNF-alpha expression through an increase in circulating and/or local vascular TNF-alpha production. The increase in TNF-alpha expression induces the production of ROS (reactive oxygen species), resulting in endothelial dysfunction in many pathophysiological conditions. Lipid metabolism, dietary supplements and physical activity affect TNF-alpha expression. The interaction between TNF-alpha and stem cells is also important in terms of vascular repair or regeneration. Careful scrutiny of these factors may help elucidate the mechanisms that induce vascular dysfunction. The focus of the present review is to summarize recent evidence showing the role of TNF-alpha in vascular dysfunction in cardiovascular disease. We believe these findings may prompt new directions for targeting inflammation in future therapies.",Zhang H; Park Y; Wu J; Chen Xp; Lee S; Yang J; Dellsperger KC; Zhang C,"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",2009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19118493/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Indeed, observational studies, and more and more interventional studies, are raising the importance of a significant vitamin D supplementation for not-only skeletal benefits. Among them, 25-OH vitamin D has been found to play an important role in prevention of cancers, auto-immune diseases, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and infections. Vitamin D deficiency, defined as serum 25-OH vitamin D levels <30 ng/mL, is very common in our population. The cost/benefit ratio and some recently published studies are clearly now in favor of a controlled and efficient vitamin D supplementation in these patients presenting a 25-OH vitamin D level <30 ng/mL.

19087368,Dairy product consumption and the metabolic syndrome.,"The metabolic syndrome is an important risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus and CVD. Epidemiological studies have now suggested protective effects of dairy product consumption on the development of this syndrome. Here we review the physiological effects and possible mechanisms involved of three main dairy constituents (Ca, protein, fat) on important components of the metabolic syndrome. Ca supplements improve the serum lipoprotein profile, particularly by decreasing serum total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations. They also lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Insufficient evidence exists for a significant role of Ca supplements or dairy in body-weight management. Effects of Ca may be related to intestinal binding to fatty acids or bile acids, or to changes in intracellular Ca metabolism by suppressing calciotropic hormones. Dietary proteins may increase satiety in both the short and longer term, which may result in a reduced energy intake. They have also been reported to improve the serum lipoprotein profile as compared with carbohydrates. Dairy proteins are precursors of angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory peptides, which may lower blood pressure. Such effects, however, have inconsistently been reported in human studies. Finally, conjugated linoleic acid, which effectively lowers body weight in animals, has no such effect in humans in the quantities provided by dairy products. To reduce the intake of SFA, the consumption of low-fat instead of high-fat dairy products is recommended. In conclusion, more research is warranted to better understand the physiological effects and the mechanisms involved of dairy products in the prevention and treatment of the metabolic syndrome.",van Meijl LE; Vrolix R; Mensink RP,Nutrition research reviews,2008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19087368/,1,0,0,0,0,0

19057469,Acting on screening results: a guide to treating malnutrition in the community.,"Part 1 of this article described the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) and its implementation. Part 2 aims to provide basic practical guidance for treating malnutrition. Establishing the aim of treatment and undertaking a dietary assessment will provide the basis for your intervention. Addressing nutrition-related problems, such as drug induced gastrointestinal disturbances, will improve the efficacy of your treatment. A food-first approach should be adopted, paying attention to meal pattern, snacks, appropriate food choices, and food fortification. Over-the-counter supplements can be useful. Proprietary (prescribable) nutritional supplements or sip feeds should be used if dietary intervention does not sufficiently improve nutritional status. Consideration of patient preferences regarding flavour, style and presentation are necessary for compliance and particular care is required when selecting sip-feeds for patients with diabetes.

18844847,Vitamin D: a D-Lightful health perspective.,"Sunlight provides most humans with their vitamin D requirement. Adequate vitamin D(3) by synthesis in the skin or from dietary and supplemental sources is essential for bone health throughout life. Vitamin D deficiency is defined as a 25(OH)D concentration <20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L); vitamin D sufficiency as a 25(OH)D >30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L), and insufficiency as 21-29 ng/mL. Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency has been linked to a wide variety of chronic diseases including common cancers, autoimmune, cardiovascular, and infectious diseases. Healthcare professionals need to be aware of the vitamin D deficiency pandemic. Guidelines for sensible sun exposure and supplemental vitamin D of 800-1000 IU/day are needed.",Holick MF,Nutrition reviews,2008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18844847/,1,0,0,0,0,0
19042058,Is there a role for supplemented antioxidants in the prevention of atherosclerosis?,"Oxidative stress is thought to play a substantial role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Supplementation of antioxidants has been studied as a strategy in the prevention of occurrence and progression of atherosclerosis. We searched the MEDLINE and PubMed databases (up to February 2008) for randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of antioxidant (and in particular vitamins E, C and/or beta-carotene) supplementation, published in English. We identified 22 trials (N=134,590 subjects) of antioxidant supplementation for the prevention of atherosclerosis (7 primary, 13 secondary and 2 both primary and secondary). Of these studies, 10 examined the effect of a single antioxidant supplementation on primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, while 12 the effect of a combination of antioxidants. As the majority of studies included in this review does not support a possible role of antioxidant supplementation in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, no definite conclusion can be drawn to justify the use of antioxidant vitamin supplements for the prevention of atherosclerotic events.",Katsiki N; Manes C,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19042058/,1,0,0,0,0,0
19019027,Alpha-lipoic acid supplementation and diabetes.,"Diabetes is a common metabolic disorder that is usually accompanied by increased production of reactive oxygen species or by impaired antioxidant defenses. Importantly, oxidative stress is particularly relevant to the risk of cardiovascular disease. Alpha-lipoic acid (LA), a naturally occurring dithiol compound, has long been known as an essential cofactor for mitochondrial bioenergetic enzymes. LA is a very important micronutrient with diverse pharmacologic and antioxidant properties. Pharmacologically, LA improves glycemic control and polyneuropathies associated with diabetes mellitus; it also effectively mitigates toxicities associated with heavy metal poisoning. As an antioxidant, LA directly terminates free radicals, chelates transition metal ions, increases cytosolic glutathione and vitamin C levels, and prevents toxicities associated with their loss. These diverse actions suggest that LA acts by multiple mechanisms both physiologically and pharmacologically. Its biosynthesis decreases as people age and is reduced in people with compromised health, thus suggesting a possible therapeutic role for LA in such cases. Reviewed here is the known efficacy of LA with particular reference to types 1 and 2 diabetes. Particular attention is paid to the potential benefits of LA with respect to glycemic control, improved insulin sensitivity, oxidative stress, and neuropathy in diabetic patients. It appears that the major benefit of LA supplementation is in patients with diabetic neuropathy.",Singh U; Jialal I,Nutrition reviews,2008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19019027/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Prospective randomized studies (n=3), a systematic review by the Cochrane group (n=1) and prospective studies in a well defined population (n=5) provide evidence that oral cobalamin therapy may adequately treat cobalamin deficiency in elderly patients. However, the current literature does not suggest a strategy in terms of the form (hydroxy- or cyanocobalamin), frequency and duration of the treatment. This review confirms the previously reported efficacy of oral cobalamin treatment in elderly patients.

Thus, recent progress regarding the potential benefit of dietary antioxidants in the treatment of chronic diseases with a special focus on immune system and neurodegenerative disorders will be discussed here. It is well established that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in the etiology of numerous diseases, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes and cancer. Among the physiological defense system of the cell, the relevance of antioxidant molecules, such as glutathione and vitamins is quite well established. Recently, the interest of researchers has, for example, been conveyed on antioxidant enzyme systems, such as the heme oxygenase/biliverdin reductase system, which appears modulated by dietary antioxidant molecules, including polyphenols and beta-carotene. These systems possibly counteract oxidative damage very efficiently and finally modulate the activity of oxidative phenomena occurring, for instance, during pathophysiological processes. Although evidence shows that antioxidant treatment results in cytoprotection, the potential clinical benefit deriving from both nutritional and supplemental antioxidants is still under wide debate. In this line, the inappropriate assumption of some lipophylic vitamins has been associated with increased incidence of cancer rather than with beneficial effects.",Brambilla D; Mancuso C; Scuderi MR; Bosco P; Cantarella G; Lempereur L; Di Benedetto G; Pezzino S; Bernardini R,Nutrition journal,2008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18826565/,1,0,0,0,0,0
18714414,"[Nutrition, cystic fibrosis and the digestive tract].","The prevalence of hyponutrition in cystic fibrosis is high although it may vary according to the different studies. Detection of hyponutrition should be done by combining different methods, depending on their availability. However, the simplest and most validated criterion is to measure at each visit the weight (and height in children) in order to calculate the body mass index and categorizing hyponutrition according to absolute criteria: in adults < 18.5 kg/m(2), and in children as percentiles of the body mass index. Worsening of the nutritional status is directly related with the decrease in lung function parameters and it has been proposed as a morbidity (and even mortality) predictive factor in people with cystic fibrosis, independently of the level of pulmonary dysfunction. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is present is approximately 70-90% of the patients with cystic fibrosis and the genotype-phenotype correlation is high. Most of the patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency tolerate a high-fat diet provided that they are treated with pancreatic enzymes at appropriate doses. The prevalence of diabetes increases with age, reaching up 40% of the cases in patients older than 30 years. Clinical liver involvement is less prevalent (it approximately affects 1/3 of the patients). Other intestinal complications such as meconial ileus, gastroesophageal reflux, obstruction of the distal intestine, or fibrosing colon disease may also condition malnourishment. In patients with cystic fibrosis, a usual high-fat diet providing 120%-150% of the recommended calories is advised. If the nutritional goals are not achieved or maintained with diet modifications, artificial supplements may be added, although the recommendation for their use has not been endorsed by solid scientific evidences. The most frequently used preparations usually are polymeric or hypercaloric. The indications for enteral (through a tube, especially gastrostomy) or parenteral nutritional support are similar to those used in other pathologies. Dietary and nutritional control should be included in a multidisciplinary program allowing the improvement of the functional capacity and the quality of life and reducing, at least from a theoretical viewpoint, the morbimortality associated to malnourishment in these patients.",Olveira G; Olveira C,Nutricion hospitalaria,2008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18714414/,1,0,0,0,0,0
18756654,Glucosamine.,"Glucosamine is one of the most popular dietary supplements sold in the United States. Most clinical trials have focused on its use in osteoarthritis of the knee. The reported adverse effects have been relatively well studied and are generally uncommon and minor. No significant supplement-drug interactions involving glucosamine have been reported. The National Institutes of Health-sponsored Glucosamine/chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial, the largest randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving the supplement, still has not confirmed whether glucosamine is effective in the treatment of osteoarthritis. Despite conflicting results in studies, there is no clear evidence to recommend against its use. If physicians have patients who wish to try glucosamine, it would be reasonable to support a 60-day trial of glucosamine sulfate, especially in those at high risk of secondary effects from other accepted treatments. The decision to continue therapy can then be left to patients on an individual basis, while the physician monitors for possible adverse effects.

Additionally, insulin resistance has been associated with the occurrence of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Epidemiological studies indicate that obesity and diabetes have become alarmingly prevalent in recent years. Substantial evidence suggests that dietary interventions and regular exercise greatly improve body mass index and lipid profile as well as alleviate insulin resistance. Therefore, dietary supplements such as insulin-sensitizing agents may be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that chromium supplements, particularly niacin-bound chromium or chromium-nicotinate, may be effective in attenuating insulin resistance and lowering plasma cholesterol levels. Utilizing the powerful technology of nutrigenomics to identify the genes regulated by chromium supplementation may shed some light on the underlying mechanisms of chromium-gene interactions, and thus provide strategies to mitigate and prevent insulin-resistance-related disorders.",Lau FC; Bagchi M; Sen CK; Bagchi D,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,2008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18636317/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We searched Pubmed, Embase, and Web of Science using the MESH terms ""vitamin D"" and ""breast cancer"". A total of 1731 studies were identified, but only 6 studies contained original data on the association between intake of vitamin D and risk of breast cancer. Overall there was no association between amount of vitamin D and risk of breast cancer (RR=0.98, 95% CI: 0.93-1.03, test for heterogeneity p<0.01). However, most studies reported on very low intakes of vitamin D (typically in the range 100-400 IU/day). Restricting the analyses to intakes > or =400 IU/day yielded a more homogenous result with a trend towards less breast cancer with > or =400 IU/day vs. the lowest intake (typically <50-150 IU/day), RR=0.92, 95% CI: 0.87-0.97, p for heterogeneity 0.14.

18590347,"Alzheimer's disease, amnestic mild cognitive impairment, and age-associated memory impairment: current understanding and progress toward integrative prevention.","Alzheimer's disease, AD, is the most common form of dementia. AD initially targets memory and progressively destroys the mind. The brain atrophies as the neocortex suffers neuronal, synaptic, and dendritic losses, and the hallmark amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles proliferate. Pharmacological management, at best, is palliative and transiently effective, with marked adverse effects. Certain nutrients intrinsic to human biochemistry (orthomolecules) match or exceed pharmacological drug benefits in double-blind, randomized, controlled trials, with superior safety. Early intervention is feasible because its heritability is typically minimal and pathological deterioration is detectable years prior to diagnosis. The syndrome amnestic mild cognitive impairment exhibits AD pathology and to date has frustrated attempts at intervention. The condition age-associated memory impairment is a nonpathological extreme of normal brain aging, but with less severe cognitive impairment than amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Age-associated memory impairment is a feasible target for early intervention against AD, beginning with the modifiable AD risk factors - smoking, hypertension, homocysteine, type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, and obesity. Stress reduction, avoidance of toxins, and mental and physical exercise are important aspects of prevention. The diet should emphasize omega-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid; flavonoids and other antioxidant nutrients; and B vitamins, especially folate, B6 and B12. Dietary supplementation is best focused on those proven from randomized, controlled trials: the phospholipids phosphatidylserine and glycerophosphocholine, the energy nutrient acetyl-L-carnitine, vitamins C and E, and other antioxidants.

18514622,Amino acids and mitochondrial biogenesis.,"Mitochondria are sources of energy production through their role in producing adenosine triphosphate for cell metabolism. Defective mitochondrial biogenesis and function play relevant roles in the pathophysiology of relevant diseases, including obesity, diabetes mellitus, myopathies, and neurodegenerative diseases. Their function is the product of synthesis of macromolecules within the mitochondria and import of proteins and lipids synthesized outside the organelles. Both are required for mitochondrial proliferation and may also facilitate the growth of preexisting mitochondria. Recent evidence indicates that these events are regulated in a complex way by several agonists and environmental conditions, through activation of specific signaling pathways and transcription factors. Nitric oxide (NO) appears to be a novel modulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. High levels of NO acutely inhibit cell respiration by binding to cytochrome c oxidase. Conversely, chronic, low-grade increases of NO stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis in diverse cell types. Here, we suggest that some types of nutrients, including specific mixtures of amino acids, may improve mitochondrial biogenesis and energy production in energy-defective conditions by increasing endothelial NO synthase expression.",Nisoli E; Cozzi V; Carruba MO,The American journal of cardiology,2008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18514622/,1,0,0,0,0,0
18514621,Intracellular mechanisms of metabolism regulation: the role of signaling via the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway and other routes.,"The development of diabetes mellitus is the consequence of defects in the action of insulin in skeletal muscles and adipose tissue other than pancreas and liver defects. Insulin action defects are mostly the results of defects of the insulin intracellular signaling transduction pathway. This review summarizes the main mechanisms involved in insulin signaling and possible intracellular defects that lead to insulin resistance. We also report preliminary experimental data that suggest the existence of intracellular alternatives to insulin metabolic pathways stimulated by nutrients such as amino acids (AAs). Indeed, we found that oral supplements with AAs stimulated both glucose transporter-4 and protein synthesis through independent insulin signals in rat hearts. Evidence suggests that the mammalian target of rapamycin and/or other molecules could be involved in this insulin-independent metabolic pathway. This hypothesis suggests the presence of an ancestral metabolic pathway in eukaryotic cells that is not active when insulin intracellular signaling is efficient but can be activated by alternative stimuli, such as AAs, when insulin signaling is impaired. Our observations provide molecular evidence that supports the use of anabolic nutrients such as AAs, together with standard therapies, to overcome insulin resistance syndrome.",Flati V; Pasini E; D'Antona G; Speca S; Toniato E; Martinotti S,The American journal of cardiology,2008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18514621/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Hypothetically, dietary antioxidants should decrease oxidative stress and therefore improve glucose metabolism. However, many interventional trials evaluating the effect of antioxidant supplementation on insulin resistance, plasma glucose levels and risk of type 2 diabetes gave inconsistent results. Many studies have recently demonstrated a positive effect of vitamin supplementation and of food enriched in antioxidant (seafood, whole nut, etc.) on markers of oxidative stress, insulin resistance, fasting plasma glucose and incidence of diabetes. The present paper critically reviews the consolidated notions on dietary antioxidant in view of the recent evidences.

18537692,Efficacy of dietary supplementation with botanicals on carbohydrate metabolism in humans.,"Botanical products are widely used in nutritional supplementation for promotion of health or prevention of diseases. With the high prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, abnormalities in carbohydrate metabolism are common in the general population and obtaining glycemic control is important in reducing the complications of diabetes. If shown to be effective, botanical products have a unique position in potentially aiding the general public in regard to obesity and diabetes. They can be obtained ""over-the-counter"" and may have less side effects compared to many synthetic drugs. Although most of the popular botanicals have a long history in folk medicine, there is paucity of data regarding their efficacy and safety, particularly as it relates to human studies. In this review, we discuss the data that was available in the literature for nine botanicals that are frequently promoted to help manage blood glucose. They are Bitter Melon (Momordica charantia), Fenugreek (trigonella foenum graecum), Gymnema Sylvestre, Ivy Gourd (Coccinia indica), Nopal or Prickly Pear Cactus (Opuntia streptacantha), Ginseng, Aloe Vera, Russian Tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus), and Garlic (Allium sativum). The discussion is emphasized on the clinical aspect of these botanicals. Due to the lack of sufficient evidence from clinical studies for any of the botanicals reviewed, it is premature to actively recommend use of any particular herb to treat either glucose or other risk factors.

Randomised trials comparing antioxidant vitamin and/or mineral supplement to control were identified by systematic electronic searches (updated August 2007) and contact with investigators. Data were pooled after investigating clinical and statistical heterogeneity. There was no evidence that antioxidant (vitamin E or beta-carotene) supplementation prevented AMD. A total of 23 099 people were randomised in three trials with treatment duration of 4-12 years; pooled risk ratio=1.03 (95% CI, 0.74-1.43). There was evidence that antioxidant (beta-carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E) and zinc supplementation slowed down the progression to advanced AMD and visual acuity loss in people with signs of the disease (adjusted odds ratio=0.68, 95% CI, 0.53-0.87 and 0.77, 95% CI, 0.62-0.96, respectively). The majority of people were randomised in one trial (AREDS, 3640 people randomised). There were seven other small trials (total randomised 525). Current evidence does not support the use of antioxidant vitamin supplements to prevent AMD. People with AMD, or early signs of the disease, may experience some benefit from taking supplements as used in the AREDS trial. Potential harms of high-dose antioxidant supplementation must be considered. These may include an increased risk of lung cancer in smokers (beta-carotene), heart failure in people with vascular disease or diabetes (vitamin E) and hospitalisation for genitourinary conditions (zinc).",Evans J,"Eye (London, England)",2008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18425071/,0,1,0,1,0,0

During the last decades, many studies attempted to affect the outcome of various diseases by zinc supplementation. These efforts either aimed at supporting immunity by zinc administration or at correcting a loss of zinc secondary to the disease to restore the zinc-dependent functions of the immune system. This review aims to summarize the respective findings and to discuss possible molecular mechanisms by which zinc could influence viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections, autoimmune diseases, and the response to vaccination. Zinc supplementation in diseases such as diarrhea, chronic hepatitis C, shigellosis, leprosy, tuberculosis, pneumonia, acute lower respiratory infection, and leishmaniasis seems beneficial. In contrast, the results for the common cold and malaria are still not conclusive, and zinc was ineffective in most vaccination and rheumatoid arthritis studies. For AIDS and type 1 diabetes, zinc supplementation may even be a risk factor for increased mortality or deterioration of the glucose metabolism, respectively. In these cases, zinc supplementation should be used with care and limited to clearly zinc-deficient individuals.",Overbeck S; Rink L; Haase H,Archivum immunologiae et therapiae experimentalis,2008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18250973/,1,0,0,0,0,0

18196987,"Role of dietary magnesium in cardiovascular disease prevention, insulin sensitivity and diabetes.","This review summarizes the evidence for benefits of magnesium on metabolic abnormalities, inflammatory parameters, and cardiovascular risk factors and related-potential mechanisms. Controversy due to contrasting results in the literature is also discussed. Increased dietary magnesium intake confers protection against the incidence of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. It ameliorates insulin resistance, serum lipid profiles, and lowers inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and platelet aggregability. Magnesium acts as a mild calcium antagonist on vascular smooth muscle tone, and on postreceptor insulin signaling; it is critically involved in energy metabolism, fatty acid synthesis, glucose utilization, ATPase functions, release of neurotransmitters, and endothelial cell function and secretion. Prospective studies, however, have found only a modest effect for dietary magnesium on incident pathologies. Furthermore, magnesium supplementation on glucose metabolism, blood lipid levels, and ischemic heart disease has given inconsistent results. There is strong biological plausibility for the direct impact of magnesium intake on metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors, but in-vivo magnesium deficiency might play only a modest role. Reverse causality, the strong association between magnesium and other beneficial nutrients, or the possibility that people who choose magnesium-rich foods are more health-conscious may be confounding factors.",Bo S; Pisu E,Current opinion in lipidology,2008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18196987/,1,0,0,0,0,0
18196986,Selenium intake and cardiovascular risk: what is new?,"Selenium is an essential element with a narrow safety margin. Adequate selenium intake is needed to maximize the activity of glutathione peroxidases and other selenoproteins. This review discusses recent experimental and epidemiologic contributions on the role of selenium for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Few randomized trials have evaluated the efficacy of selenium supplementation on cardiovascular endpoints. Most trials, conducted in selenium-replete populations, found no evidence of cardiovascular protection. A meta-analysis of 13 prospective cohort studies found a moderate inverse relationship between plasma/serum selenium and coronary heart disease. The interpretation of these data is complicated, however, by potential residual confounding and publication bias. In contrast, recent data from trials of selenium-containing supplements and from epidemiologic studies suggest that chronically increased selenium intake in selenium-replete populations can induce diabetes and maybe also hypercholesterolemia. Current evidence is insufficient to support a protective role for selenium in cardiovascular prevention. Large high-quality randomized controlled trials and observational studies are needed across populations with different levels of selenium intake. Furthermore, subjects living in regions with high selenium intake should be aware that selenium supplements may increase their risk of diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.",Navas-Acien A; Bleys J; Guallar E,Current opinion in lipidology,2008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18196986/,1,0,0,0,0,1
19548590,Metabolic syndrome (does it have a common denominator?).,"The insufficient or inappropriate supply of PUFA OMEGA-3 (esp. docosahexaenoic and eicosa pentaenoic acid DHA and EPA) can be suggested to be a common factor of the four metabolic syndrome's clinical manifestations. DHA can be considered as one of the most important element of the membrane. The protective and beneficial effects of DHA (and EPA) result from the dynamic qualities of its molecular structure as well as from its recently detected effects on the genetic expression of several cytokines, enzymes etc. Dietary supplementation of DHA improves all clinical symptoms and laboratory biochemical markers of the metabolic syndrome. Together with that, depletion of DHA was found in diabetes and in several cardiovascular diseases. Also the developmental aspect and approach supports our view. With high probability DHA represents one of the connecting components of the development of metabolic syndrome's clinical manifestations. Metabolic syndrome could be therefore interpreted as an insufficient function of the cellular membrane.",Mourek J,Prague medical report,2008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19548590/,1,0,0,0,0,0
18090651,Vitamin D and cardiovascular disease risk.,"Despite our understanding of how to prevent and treat traditional cardiovascular risk factors, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death of both men and women in the US. Thus, there is widespread interest in a number of emerging nontraditional risk factors for the detection of early cardiovascular disease in order to implement aggressive preventive therapies. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D deficiency has been identified as a potential novel cardiovascular disease risk factor. This review outlines what is known about the association of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and cardiovascular disease risk. Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels have been associated with the cardiovascular disease risk factors of hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome, as well as cardiovascular disease events including stroke and congestive heart failure. Studies suggest vitamin D deficiency may be a contributor to the development of cardiovascular disease potentially through associations with diabetes or hypertension. Vitamin D deficiency is easy to screen for and easy to treat with supplementation. Further larger observational studies and randomized clinical trials are, however, needed to determine whether vitamin D supplementation could have any potential benefit in reducing future cardiovascular disease events and mortality risk.",Michos ED; Melamed ML,Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,2008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18090651/,1,0,0,0,0,0
18057551,"Diabetes, metallothionein, and zinc interactions: a review.","Epidemiological evidence, associating diabetes with zinc (Zn) deficiencies, has resulted in numerous research studies describing the effects of Zn and associated metallothionein (MT), on reducing diabetic complications associated with oxidative stress. MT has been found to have a profound effect on the reduction of oxidative stress induced by the diabetic condition. Over expression of MT in various metabolic organs has also been shown to reduce hyperglycaemia-induced oxidative stress, organ specific diabetic complications, and DNA damage in diabetic experimental animals, which have been further substantiated by the results from MT-knockout mice. Additionally, supplementation with Zn has been shown to induce in vivo MT synthesis in experimental animals and to reduce diabetes related complications in both humans and animal models. Although the results are promising, some caution regarding this topic is however necessary, due to the fact that the majority of the studies done have been animal based. Hence more human intervention trials are needed regarding the positive effects of MT and Zn before firm conclusions can be made regarding their use in the treatment of diabetes.",Islam MS; Loots du T,"BioFactors (Oxford, England)",2007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18057551/,1,0,0,0,0,0

18031964,Possible roles of zinc nutriture in the fetal origins of disease.,"Risk of diseases of metabolism such as atherosclerosis and adult onset diabetes mellitus is increased by fetal malnutrition. Deficiencies of micronutrients essential for methylation are believed to contribute to the phenomenon in part through epigenetic abnormalities. Zinc is one of the nutrients essential for the epigenome. Because the worldwide prevalence of zinc deficiency is at least 20%, fetal zinc deficiency is common. We suggest fetal zinc deficiency contributes to the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases in adults. In support of our thesis, research in experimental models and humans established the essentiality of zinc at all stages of intrauterine and infant life. Experiments in rodents and/or non-human primates found that fetal and/or suckling zinc deficiency impairs neuropsychological functions of progeny and that the effects persist in spite of nutritional rehabilitation. In addition, maternal zinc deficiency in mice is reported to impair immunity of progeny; effects persist in spite of nutritional rehabilitation into the next generation. We suspect that zinc deficiency is a far greater human health problem than is generally recognized.",Maret W; Sandstead HH,Experimental gerontology,2007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18031964/,1,0,0,0,0,0

There is growing evidence that chromium may facilitate insulin signaling and chromium supplementation therefore may improve systemic insulin sensitivity. Tissue chromium levels of subjects with diabetes are lower than those of normal control subjects, and a correlation exists between low circulating levels of chromium and the incidence of type 2 diabetes. Controversy still exists as to the need for chromium supplementation. However, supplementation with chromium picolinate, a stable and highly bioavailable form of chromium, has been shown to reduce insulin resistance and to help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Since chromium supplementation is a safe treatment, further research is necessary to resolve the confounding data. The existing data suggest to concentrate future studies on certain forms as chromium picolinate and doses as at least 200 mcg per day.",Hummel M; Standl E; Schnell O,Hormone and metabolic research = Hormon- und Stoffwechselforschung = Hormones et metabolisme,2007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17952838/,1,0,0,0,0,0
17876192,"Autonomic nervous system, heart rate variability and n-3 fatty acids.","Animal and in-vitro studies have shown profound antiarrhythmic effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on the heart. Because n-3 PUFAs (in particular docosahexaenoic acid) are abundant in nervous tissue, this antiarrhythmic effect may be mediated by effects of n-3 PUFAs on autonomic control or tone. This paper reviews the effect of n-3 PUFAs on heart rate variability, a noninvasive indicator of cardiac autonomic function. In most, although not all, studies, dietary n-3 PUFA levels and n-3 PUFA supplementation are related to improved heart rate variability. Although further research is required to confirm these relationships, the results support a beneficial effect of n-3 PUFAs on autonomic tone in humans, specifically an increase in vagal tone, which may reduce the risk of arrhythmias. The modulation of heart rate variability by n-3 PUFAs may partly explain the reduction in sudden cardiac death observed in subjects with a regular intake of n-3 PUFAs.",Christensen JH; Schmidt EB,"Journal of cardiovascular medicine (Hagerstown, Md.)",2007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17876192/,1,0,0,0,0,0

A random-effects model was used. Five prospective randomized controlled trials (n = 282) were identified. Upon meta-analysis, the use of cinnamon did not significantly alter A1C, FBG, or lipid parameters. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses did not significantly change the results.

Recognized risk factors, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cigarette smoking, and sedentary lifestyle are associated with endothelial dysfunction. A variety of pharmacological and behavioral interventions have been shown to reverse endothelial dysfunction in patients with cardiovascular disease. A large number of epidemiological studies suggest that dietary factors, including increased intake of flavonoid-containing foods and beverages, reduce cardiovascular risk, and recent studies have shown that such beverages have favorable effects on endothelial function. These studies have engendered interest in the development of dietary supplements or drugs that would allow for more convenient and higher dose administration of flavonoids and might prove useful for prevention or treatment of cardiovascular disease. In this paper, we will review the contribution of endothelial dysfunction to the pathogenesis and clinical expression of atherosclerosis and recent data linking flavonoid and EGCG consumption to improved endothelial function and reduced cardiovascular risk.",Shenouda SM; Vita JA,Journal of the American College of Nutrition,2007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17906190/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We examined the risk of dying from any cause in subjects who participated in randomized trials testing the impact of vitamin D supplementation (ergocalciferol [vitamin D(2)] or cholecalciferol [vitamin D(3)]) on any health condition. The literature up to November 2006 was searched without language restriction using the following databases: PubMed, ISI Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. We identified 18 independent randomized controlled trials, including 57 311 participants. A total of 4777 deaths from any cause occurred during a trial size-adjusted mean of 5.7 years. Daily doses of vitamin D supplements varied from 300 to 2000 IU. The trial size-adjusted mean daily vitamin D dose was 528 IU. In 9 trials, there was a 1.4- to 5.2-fold difference in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D between the intervention and control groups. The summary relative risk for mortality from any cause was 0.93 (95% confidence interval, 0.87-0.99). There was neither indication for heterogeneity nor indication for publication biases. The summary relative risk did not change according to the addition of calcium supplements in the intervention. Intake of ordinary doses of vitamin D supplements seems to be associated with decreases in total mortality rates. The relationship between baseline vitamin D status, dose of vitamin D supplements, and total mortality rates remains to be investigated. Population-based, placebo-controlled randomized trials with total mortality as the main end point should be organized for confirming these findings.",Autier P; Gandini S,Archives of internal medicine,2007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17846391/,1,0,0,1,0,0

Electronic searches were conducted in 9 databases, 20 additional journals (not indexed in common databases), and bibliographies from 50 selected secondary references. No restrictions were placed on the language or quality of the publications. All literature collected pertained to efficacy in humans, dosing, precautions, adverse effects, use in pregnancy/lactation, interactions, alteration of laboratory assays, and mechanisms of action. Standardized inclusion/exclusion criteria are used for selection. Grades were assigned using an evidence-based grading rationale. A review of the literature on flaxseed yielded 13 categories for which flaxseed had been studied in humans, including constipation/laxative, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis/coronary artery disease, breast cancer, cyclic mastalgia (breast pain), menopausal symptoms, hyperglycemia/diabetes, hypertension, lupus nephritis, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), and prostate cancer.

17645588,Magnesium intake and risk of type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis.,"To assess the association between magnesium intake and risk of type 2 diabetes. Meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies. We retrieved studies published in any language by systematically searching MEDLINE from 1966 to February 2007 and by manually examining the references of the original articles. We included prospective cohort studies reporting relative risks with 95% confidence intervals for the association between magnesium intake and incidence of type 2 diabetes. The seven identified cohort studies of magnesium intake [from foods only (n = 4) or from foods and supplements combined (n = 3)] and incidence of type 2 diabetes included 286,668 participants and 10,912 cases. All but one study found an inverse relation between magnesium intake and risk of type 2 diabetes, and in four studies the association was statistically significant. The overall relative risk for a 100 mg day(-1) increase in magnesium intake was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.79-0.92). Results were similar for intake of dietary magnesium (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77-0.95) and total magnesium (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.77-0.89). There was no evidence of publication bias (P = 0.99). Magnesium intake was inversely associated with incidence of type 2 diabetes. This finding suggests that increased consumption of magnesium-rich foods such as whole grains, beans, nuts, and green leafy vegetables may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.",Larsson SC; Wolk A,Journal of internal medicine,2007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17645588/,1,0,0,1,0,1
17569223,Curcumin and autoimmune disease.,"The immune system has evolved to protect the host from microbial infection; nevertheless, a breakdown in the immune system often results in infection, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. Multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, myocarditis, thyroiditis, uveitis, systemic lupus erythromatosis, and myasthenia gravis are organ-specific autoimmune diseases that afflict more than 5% of the population worldwide. Although the etiology is not known and a cure is still wanting, the use of herbal and dietary supplements is on the rise in patients with autoimmune diseases, mainly because they are effective, inexpensive, and relatively safe. Curcumin is a polyphenolic compound isolated from the rhizome of the plant Curcuma longa that has traditionally been used for pain and wound-healing. Recent studies have shown that curcumin ameliorates multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease in human or animal models. Curcumin inhibits these autoimmune diseases by regulating inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma and associated JAK-STAT, AP-1, and NF-kappaB signaling pathways in immune cells. Although the beneficial effects of nutraceuticals are traditionally achieved through dietary consumption at low levels for long periods of time, the use of purified active compounds such as curcumin at higher doses for therapeutic purposes needs extreme caution. A precise understanding of effective dose, safe regiment, and mechanism of action is required for the use of curcumin in the treatment of human autoimmune diseases.",Bright JJ,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17569223/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing dietary or non-dietary intake of n-3 PUFA with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes by searching databases from 1966 to December 2006. Changes in the following variables were recorded triacylglycerol; total cholesterol; HDL, LDL and VLDL and their subfractions; lipid ratios; apolipoproteins; and cholesterol particle sizes. There were 23 trials on non-dietary supplementation, involving 1,075 subjects with a mean treatment duration of 8.9 weeks, with sufficient data to permit pooling. Compared with placebo, n-3 PUFA had a statistically significant effect on four outcomes, reducing levels of (1) triacylglycerol (18 trials, 969 subjects) by 25% (mean 0.45 mmol/l; 95% CI -0.58 to -0.32; p < 0.00001); (2) VLDL-cholesterol (7 trials, 238 subjects) by 36% (0.07 mmol/l; 95% CI -0.13 to 0.00; p = 0.04); and (3) VLDL-triacylglycerol (6 trials, 178 subjects) by 39.7% (0.44 mmol/l; 95% CI -0.83 to -0.05; p = 0.03); while slightly increasing LDL (16 trials, 565 subjects) by 5.7% (0.11 mmol/l; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.22; p = 0.05). There were no significant effects on total cholesterol, apolipoproteins, lipid subfractions or ratios. In addition to recognised triacylglycerol-lowering effects, n-3 PUFA supplementation decreases VLDL-cholesterol and VLDL-triacylglycerol, but may have an adverse effect on LDL-cholesterol.

17535033,"Potential long-term consequences of fad diets on health, cancer, and longevity: lessons learned from model organism studies.","While much of the third world starves, many in the first world are undergoing an obesity epidemic, and the related epidemics of type II diabetes, heart disease, and other diseases associated with obesity. The amount of economic wealth being directly related to a decline in health by obesity is ironic because rich countries contribute billions of dollars to improve the health of their citizens. Nevertheless, nutritional experiments in model organisms such as yeast, C. elegans, Drosophila, and mice confirm that ""caloric restriction"" (CR), which is defined generally as a 30-40% decrease in caloric intake, a famine-like condition for humans seen only in the poorest of countries, promotes good health and increases longevity in model organisms. Because caloric restriction, and dieting in general, requires a great deal of will power to deal with the feelings of deprivation, many fad diets, such as the Atkins, South Beach, and Protein Power, have been developed which allow people to lose weight purportedly without the severe feelings of deprivation. However, the long-term effects of such fad diets are not known and few experiments have been performed in the laboratory to investigate possible side affects and adverse consequences. In this paper, we review studies with fad-like dietary conditions in humans and model organisms, and we propose a ""Dietary Ames Test"" to rapidly screen fad diets, dietary supplements, and drugs for potential long-term health consequences in model organisms.",Ruden DM; Rasouli P; Lu X,Technology in cancer research & treatment,2007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17535033/,1,0,0,0,0,0

All trials with glucose metabolism outcomes and trials of individuals with diabetes or glucose intolerance for lipid outcomes were included. Meta-analyses were performed as appropriate. Forty-one studies met criteria, almost half of which were of poor quality.

There was no benefit in individuals without diabetes. There were some indications of dose effect and differences among chromium formulations. Larger effects were more commonly observed in poor-quality studies. The evidence was limited by poor study quality, heterogeneity in methodology and results, and a lack of consensus on assessment of chromium status. No significant effect of chromium on lipid or glucose metabolism was found in people without diabetes. Chromium supplementation significantly improved glycemia among patients with diabetes.

17519397,Noninherited risk factors and congenital cardiovascular defects: current knowledge: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association Council on Cardiovascular Disease in the Young: endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics.,"Prevention of congenital cardiovascular defects has been hampered by a lack of information about modifiable risk factors for abnormalities in cardiac development. Over the past decade, there have been major breakthroughs in the understanding of inherited causes of congenital heart disease, including the identification of specific genetic abnormalities for some types of malformations. Although relatively less information has been available on noninherited modifiable factors that may have an adverse effect on the fetal heart, there is a growing body of epidemiological literature on this topic. This statement summarizes the currently available literature on potential fetal exposures that might alter risk for cardiovascular defects. Information is summarized for periconceptional multivitamin or folic acid intake, which may reduce the risk of cardiac disease in the fetus, and for additional types of potential exposures that may increase the risk, including maternal illnesses, maternal therapeutic and nontherapeutic drug exposures, environmental exposures, and paternal exposures. Information is highlighted regarding definitive risk factors such as maternal rubella; phenylketonuria; pregestational diabetes; exposure to thalidomide, vitamin A cogeners, or retinoids; and indomethacin tocolysis. Caveats regarding interpretation of possible exposure-outcome relationships from case-control studies are given because this type of study has provided most of the available information. Guidelines for prospective parents that could reduce the likelihood that their child will have a major cardiac malformation are given. Issues related to pregnancy monitoring are discussed.

17484507,Vitamin D: the secosteroid hormone and human reproduction.,"Vitamin D is a secosteroid with an endocrine mechanism of action which is sequentially synthesized in humans in the skin, liver and kidneys. The active hormone, 1alpha,25-dihydrocholecalciferol [1,25(OH)2D3], is often considered only in terms of its role in controlling calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. However, cumulative evidence points to the presence of vitamin D receptors in many tissues. The present article summarizes key points regarding the participation of vitamin D in pregnancy and breastfeeding. During pregnancy, sufficient vitamin D concentrations are needed not only to address the growing demand for calcium on the part of the fetus, but also to participate in fetal growth, development of the nervous system, lung maturation and fetal immune system function. Hypovitaminosis D has been related to the development of diabetes, pre-eclampsia and fetal neurological disorders. During pregnancy and lactation, calcium from the maternal skeleton is mobilized, with a rise in bone turnover and a reduction in bone mass. It is advisable for pregnant and nursing women to maintain adequate levels of vitamin D, through small doses of solar exposure to facilitate natural formation of the hormone or by ingesting appropriate vitamin supplements. Further studies are needed to clarify the many gaps in knowledge and elucidate the role of vitamin D in the context of reproduction.

17484443,[Unconventional antidiabetic agents].,"The current pharmacological therapy of type 2 diabetes reduces the risk of diabetic complications, but is not able to achieve a long-lasting normalization of the metabolic disorder. Thus diabetic patients in increasing numbers are taking dietary supplements and herbs from which they expect additional health benefits. These unconventional antidiabetic agents consist mainly in trace metals like chromium, vanadium and zinc and a heterogeneous group of traditionally used antidiabetic herbs (e. g. Momordica charantia, Gymnema sylvestre, Trigonella foenum-graecum) often derived from the ayurvedic medicine. In this overview the current evidence for the antidiabetic effect is presented. The trace elements chromium and vanadium have a number of potentially antidiabetic actions in vitro, however, the results obtained with diabetic patients are not convincing so far. Similarly, the available data on the therapeutic use of herbs suggest that in principle a number of them possess a blood glucose-lowering effect, but at present no firm conclusions as to their efficacy and safety can be made. To set up reliable dose-effect relationships requires the identification of the relevant antidiabetic molecules as was apparently achieved by isolating 4-hydroxyisoleucine from the seeds of T. foenum-graecum. This requirement is also valid in the case of the antidiabetic action of cinnamon. Coffee and a moderate alcohol consumption were found to be surprisingly effective in lowering the risk of type 2 diabetes manifestation, their effect being roughly equal to that of conventional drugs used in diabetes prevention trials. Diabetic patients should inform their physician about the use of unconventional agents and should be warned against uncontrolled starting or stopping their use.",Rustenbeck I,Medizinische Monatsschrift fur Pharmazeuten,2007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17484443/,1,0,0,0,0,0
17464160,Prophylactic role for complementary and alternative medicine in perinatal programming of adult health.,"The health status of an individual in adulthood is proposed to be determined by events occurring in the prenatal and early postnatal period. A common early life event proven to have long lasting effects on the developing fetus is stress, including pain. Exposure of fetal and neonatal infants to repetitive psychological (e.g., maternal stress) or physiological (e.g., pain, infection, and noise) stress during this period is proposed to alter mechanisms involved in the regulation of stress, immunological maturation, pain perception, and cognition. Such changes, which persist into adulthood, may occur via alterations in the development of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This process is typically referred to as 'perinatal programming'. Ontogenic alterations in the development of the HPA-axis have been related to a number of adult pathologies such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, asthma, as well as psychopathologies such as anxiety and depression. In this review, the effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), such as music, dietary supplements, massage and aromatherapy, in reducing perinatal stress in mothers and infants is examined. An emphasis is placed on these therapies as preventative measures which may be of value to individuals at risk of developing disease profiles associated with the consequences of adverse perinatal programming. The widening interest in perinatal programming and CAM suggests the potential for CAM to become a valuable tool in offsetting negative adult health outcomes resulting from perinatal programming associated with adverse gestational early life environments.",Hodgson DM; Nakamura T; Walker AK,Forschende Komplementarmedizin (2006),2007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17464160/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The prevalence of these diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, may have a significant effect on perioperative management, surgical outcome, and complication rates in these patients. Nutritional intervention and supplementation may help curb some of these potential adverse affects of poor nutrition by promoting wound healing; enhancing immunity; reducing swelling, bruising, and inflammation; and reducing oxidation caused by anesthetic agents and surgery. Although a perioperative regimen of dietary supplements may enhance surgical outcomes, it is equally important to know the popular herbal products that are contraindicated in the perioperative period.",Rahm DH; Labovitz JM,Clinics in podiatric medicine and surgery,2007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17430769/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Dietary factors are hypothesized to play a significant role in prostate cancer, and have proven to be important in managing prevalent comorbidities in this patient population (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis). Data regarding diet and prostate cancer are accumulating and randomized controlled trials are underway which will ultimately yield evidence on which to base recommendations regarding dietary regimens, functional foods, and supplement use. Until that time, most data derive from epidemiologic studies that have limitations in showing cause and effect. During the past year, the greatest and most consistent strides have been made in the area of energy balance, with data consistently showing that overweight and obesity are associated with progressive disease and increased overall mortality. To date, the strongest evidence regarding diet and prostate cancer relates to energy balance. Urologists aspiring to best clinical practice should encourage their patients to achieve a healthful body weight through regular exercise and a healthful plant-based diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Advocating functional foods or supplements explicitly for cancer control purposes would currently be premature.",Demark-Wahnefried W; Moyad MA,Current opinion in urology,2007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17414514/,1,0,0,0,0,0
17381386,Cinnamon supplementation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Diabetes mellitus is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, and most patients with the disease have type 2 diabetes. The effectiveness of cinnamon supplementation in patients with type 2 diabetes has received a great deal of media attention after a study was published in 2003. Although the efficacy of cinnamon in patients with diabetes has not been established, many patients seek other therapies and supplement their prescribed pharmacologic therapy with cinnamon. We conducted a literature search, limited to English-language human studies, using MEDLINE (1966-August 2006), EMBASE (1980-August 2006), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-August 2006), and Iowa Drug Information Service (1966-August 2006). References from articles and clinical trials were reviewed for additional sources; no abstracts were reviewed. We found two prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, peer-reviewed clinical trials and one prospective, placebo-controlled, peer-reviewed clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy of cinnamon supplementation in patients with type 2 diabetes; a total of 164 patients were involved in these trials. Two of the studies reported modest improvements in lowering blood glucose levels with cinnamon supplementation in small patient samples. One trial showed no significant difference between cinnamon and placebo in lowering blood glucose levels. Overall, cinnamon was well tolerated. These data suggest that cinnamon has a possible modest effect in lowering plasma glucose levels in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. However, clinicians are strongly urged to refrain from recommending cinnamon supplementation in place of the proven standard of care, which includes lifestyle modifications, oral antidiabetic agents, and insulin therapy.",Pham AQ; Kourlas H; Pham DQ,Pharmacotherapy,2007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17381386/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Although excessive protein intake may negatively influence the progression of renal disease, diabetics are rather reluctant to restrict their protein intake. However, in diabetic patients with renal failure, dietary protein restriction seems to have a beneficial effect on the course of the nephropathy without untoward effect on nutritional status. Moreover, the reduction in protein intake improves insulin sensitivity and has beneficial influences on different steps of carbohydrate metabolism.

17311876,Antioxidant vitamin supplementation in cardiovascular diseases.,"Cardiovascular disease is the most important adult health problem in wealthy countries, where biological factors such as obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, inappropriate diet, cigarette smoking, and sedentary life-style have contributed to its dissemination. Research concerning nutritional regimens has shown that persons who consume large amounts of fruit and vegetables have lower incidences of cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and tumors, although the precise mechanisms for this protective effect are elusive. Possible explanations include (a) increased consumption of dietary fiber, (b) reduced consumption of dietary cholesterol and other lipids, and (c) increased intake of the antioxidant vitamins (A, C, and E). Numerous studies have raised the question whether vitamin supplements help to prevent cardiovascular diseases. Results of randomized controlled trials of antioxidant vitamin supplements in large numbers of participants has been ambiguous or contradictory. This minireview examines the relevant clinical reports on dietary supplements of vitamins A, C, and E to determine whether they support the premise that patients at risk of cardiovascular disease may be candidates for this therapeutic option.",Riccioni G; Bucciarelli T; Mancini B; Corradi F; Di Ilio C; Mattei PA; D'Orazio N,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,2007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17311876/,1,0,0,0,0,0

17302540,Placental transfer of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA).,"Considerable evidence exists for marked beneficial effects of omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) during pregnancy. The omega-3 LC-PUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is incorporated in large amounts in fetal brain and other tissues during the second half of pregnancy, and several studies have provided evidence for a link between early DHA status of the mother and visual and cognitive development of her child after birth. Moreover, the supplementation of omega-3 LC-PUFA during pregnancy increases slightly infant size at birth, and significantly reduces early preterm birth before 34 weeks of gestation by 31%. In our studies using stable isotope methodology in vivo, we demonstrated active and preferential materno-fetal transfer of DHA across the human placenta and found the expression of human placental fatty acid binding and transport proteins. From the correlation of DHA values with placental fatty acid transport protein 4 (FATP 4), we conclude that this protein is of key importance in mediating DHA transport across the human placenta. Given the great importance of placental DHA transport for infant outcome, further studies are needed to fully appreciate the effects and optimal strategies of omega-3 fatty acid interventions in pregnancy, dose response relationships, and the potential differences between subgroups of subjects such as women with gestational diabetes or other gestational pathology. Such studies should contribute to optimize substrate intake during pregnancy and lactation that may improve pregnancy outcome as well as fetal growth and development.",Koletzko B; Larqué E; Demmelmair H,Journal of perinatal medicine,2007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17302540/,1,0,0,0,0,0
17253560,Zinc supplementation for the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"The chronic hyperglycaemia of diabetes is associated with long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of various organs, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels. The risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with age, obesity, and lack of physical activity. Insulin resistance is a fundamental aspect of the aetiology of type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance has been shown to be associated with atherosclerosis, hypertriglyceridaemia, glucose intolerance, dyslipidaemia, hyperuricaemia, hypertension and polycystic ovary syndrome. The mineral zinc plays a key role in the synthesis and action of insulin, both physiologically and in diabetes mellitus. Zinc seems to stimulate insulin action and insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity. To assess the effects of the zinc supplementation in the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Studies were obtained from computerised searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and The Cochrane Library. Studies were included if they had a randomised or quasi-randomised design and if they investigated zinc supplementation in adults living in the community, 18 years or older with insulin resistance (compared to placebo or no intervention). Two authors selected relevant trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. Only one study met the inclusion criteria of this review. There were 56 normal glucose tolerant obese women (aged 25 to 45 years, body mass index 36.2 +/- 2.3 kg/m(2)). Follow-up was four weeks. The outcomes measured were decrease of insulin resistance, anthropometric and diet parameters, leptin and insulin concentration, zinc concentration in the plasma and urine, lipid metabolism and fasting plasma glucose. There were no statistically significant differences favouring participants receiving zinc supplementation compared to placebo concerning any outcome measured by the study. There is currently no evidence to suggest the use of zinc supplementation in the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Future trials will have to standardise outcomes measures such as incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, decrease of the insulin resistance, quality of life, diabetic complications, all-cause mortality and costs.",Beletate V; El Dib RP; Atallah AN,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17253560/,0,1,0,0,0,1

17168669,Gamma linolenic acid: an antiinflammatory omega-6 fatty acid.,"Inflammation plays an important role in health and disease. Most of the chronic diseases of modern society, including cancer, diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, etc. have inflammatory component. At the same time, the link between diet and disease is also being recognized. Amongst dietary constituents, fat has gained most recognition in affecting health. Saturated and trans fatty acids have been implicated in obesity, heart disease, diabetes and cancer while polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) generally have a positive effect on health. The PUFAs of omega-3 and omega-6 series play a significant role in health and disease by generating potent modulatory molecules for inflammatory responses, including eicosanoids (prostaglandins, and leukotrienes), and cytokines (interleukins) and affecting the gene expression of various bioactive molecules. Gamma linolenic acid (GLA, all cis 6, 9, 12-Octadecatrienoic acid, C18:3, n-6), is produced in the body from linoleic acid (all cis 6,9-octadecadienoic acid), an essential fatty acid of omega-6 series by the enzyme delta-6-desaturase. Preformed GLA is present in trace amounts in green leafy vegetables and in nuts. The most significant source of GLA for infants is breast milk. GLA is further metabolized to dihomogamma linlenic acid (DGLA) which undergoes oxidative metabolism by cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases to produce anti-inflammatory eicosanoids (prostaglandins of series 1 and leukotrienes of series 3). GLA and its metabolites also affect expression of various genes where by regulating the levels of gene products including matrix proteins. These gene products play a significant role in immune functions and also in cell death (apoptosis). The present review will emphasize the role of GLA in modulating inflammatory response, and hence its potential applications as an anti-inflammatory nutrient or adjuvant.",Kapoor R; Huang YS,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,2006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17168669/,1,0,0,0,0,0

17155851,The role of the antioxidant vitamin supplementation in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.,"Industrial and technological revolutions have resulted in dramatic shifts in the diseases that are responsible for illness and death. In particular, cardiovascular disease (CVD) has emerged as the dominant chronic disease in many parts of the world. Diet, tobacco smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, lipid levels, hypertension and diabetes mellitus have contributed to their wide diffusion. Oxidative damage and the production of free radicals in the endothelium are two of the main factors involved in the pathogenesis of the atherosclerotic process that causes CVD. One of the more important results of basic research on dietetic regimes has shown that people who consume large amounts of fruits and vegetables have a lower incidence of CVD, stroke and tumours, but the specific mechanisms of these foods (which have an apparently protective effect) are still not completely clear. Possible reasons could include a greater consumption of fruit and vegetables, and an increased consumption of dietetic fibres. Recently, it been proposed that micronourishments with an antioxidant activity could be responsible for the reduction of chronic diseases. Research supplies a hypothetical mechanism by which antioxidant substances may be reducing the risk of atherosclerosis through the inhibition of oxidative damage. Appropriate nutritional practices are of central importance in managing risk and treatment of CVD; in fact, many current guidelines for a healthy general population contain nutritional recommendations to reduce the risk of these diseases. A large number of descriptive and case-control studies suggests that the consumption of many antioxidant vitamins (A, C and E) reduces the risk of CVD. Such data raises the following problem of whether supplementation of vitamins A, C and E emerges as being useful in the primary prevention of CVD. Many important studies involving a great number of participants have not confirmed this hypothesis and the results are often contradictory. This review examines the studies published in the literature that document the effect of supplementation with antioxidant vitamins (A, C and E) in the primary and secondary prevention of CVD due to an atherosclerosis process.",Riccioni G; Bucciarelli T; Mancini B; Di Ilio C; Capra V; D'Orazio N,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,2007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17155851/,1,0,0,0,0,0

17130578,Is it dietary insulin?,"In humans the primary trigger of insulin-specific immunity is a modified self-antigen, that is, dietary bovine insulin, which breaks neonatal tolerance to self-insulin. The immune response induced by bovine insulin spreads to react with human insulin. This primary immune response induced in the gut immune system is regulated by the mechanisms of oral tolerance. Genetic factors and environmental factors, such as the gut microflora, breast milk-derived factors, and enteral infections, control the development of oral tolerance. The age of host modifies the immune response to oral antigens because the permeability of the gut decreases with age and mucosal immune response, such as IgA response, develops with age. The factors that control the function of the gut immune system may either be protective from autoimmunity by supporting tolerance, or they may induce autoimmunity by abating tolerance to dietary insulin. There is accumulating evidence that the intestinal immune system is aberrant in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Intestinal immune activation and increased gut permeability are associated with T1D. These aberrancies may be responsible for the impaired control of tolerance to dietary insulin. Later in life, factors that activate insulin-specific immune cells derived from the gut may switch the response toward cytotoxic immunity. Viruses, which infect beta cells, may release autoantigens and potentiate their presentation by an infection-associated ""danger signal."" This kind of secondary immunization may cause functional changes in the dietary insulin primed immune cells, and lead to the infiltration of insulin-reactive T cells to the pancreatic islets.",Vaarala O,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,2006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17130578/,1,0,0,0,0,0

It will put into context the increased use of nutritional supplements in pregnancy and whether there is an evidence base for this supplementation. Women are not consuming enough nutrients from their diet alone and food is depleted in many important minerals. There is increasing support that supplementation of specific vitamins, minerals and omega-3 fatty acids can have a positive impact on maternal health in terms of prevention of preeclampsia, miscarriage, preterm birth, low birthweight, gestational diabetes and also on the long-term health of the baby. There are some contradictory findings with antioxidants and prevention of preeclampsia, and these are discussed. With soil depletion, overfarming and transportation of foods over hundreds of miles with loss of nutrients en route, together with the increased use of convenience and fast foods, women can be over-fed, but under-nourished in our modern society. These can lead to nutrient deficiencies which can have an impact on the outcome of pregnancy. Evidence shows that supplementation can play a valuable role in the health of the pregnant mother and her baby. Emphasis must always be on eating a good diet, but given the limitations of the 21st century lifestyle and the nutritional content of food, good quality nutritional supplements should be used during pregnancy in combinations rather than isolated single nutrients.",Glenville M,Current opinion in obstetrics & gynecology,2006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17099336/,1,0,0,0,0,0
17093274,Promoting health and physical function among cancer survivors: potential for prevention and questions that remain.,"Cancer survivors are at increased risk, not only for progressive and recurrent disease, but also other cancers, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, and functional decline. Lifestyle interventions to improve dietary and physical activity behaviors, and smoking cessation, have the potential to improve the overall health and quality of life of this vulnerable population. Studies on overall health and physical function from 1966 and beyond regarding the impact of behavioral interventions that used randomized and controlled designs were identified through MEDLINE and PubMed searches. Published reports currently exist for 22 exercise interventions, 11 diet-related interventions (excluding those limited to dietary supplements or single nutrients), two diet and exercise interventions, and 10 behavioral-based smoking cessation interventions.

These Guidelines, published every 5 years, are developed by a national panel of experts in cancer research, prevention, epidemiology, public health, and policy, and as such, they represent the most current scientific evidence related to dietary and activity patterns and cancer risk. The ACS Guidelines include recommendations for individual choices regarding diet and physical activity patterns, but those choices occur within a community context that either facilitates or interferes with healthy behaviors. Community efforts are essential to create a social environment that promotes healthy food choices and physical activity. Therefore, this committee presents one key recommendation for community action to accompany the four recommendations for individual choices to reduce cancer risk. This recommendation for community action recognizes that a supportive social environment is indispensable if individuals at all levels of society are to have genuine opportunities to choose healthy behaviors.

16929242,Tomatoes versus lycopene in oxidative stress and carcinogenesis: conclusions from clinical trials.,"To review the effects of tomato product supplementation, containing lycopene, on biomarkers of oxidative stress and carcinogenesis in human clinical trials. Supplementation of tomato products, containing lycopene, has been shown to lower biomarkers of oxidative stress and carcinogenesis in healthy and type II diabetic patients, and prostate cancer patients, respectively. Processed tomato products like tomato juice, tomato paste, tomato puree, tomato ketchup and tomato oleoresin have been shown to provide bioavailable sources of lycopene, with consequent increases in plasma lycopene levels versus baseline. Dietary fats enhance this process and should be consumed together with food sources of lycopene. The mechanisms of action involve protection of plasma lipoproteins, lymphocyte DNA and serum proteins against oxidative damage, and anticarcinogenic effects, including reduction of prostate-specific antigen, upregulation of connexin expression and overall decrease in prostate tumor aggressiveness. There is limited in vivo data on the health benefits of lycopene alone. Most of the clinical trials with tomato products suggest a synergistic action of lycopene with other nutrients, in lowering biomarkers of oxidative stress and carcinogenesis. Consumption of processed tomato products, containing lycopene, is of significant health benefit and can be attributed to a combination of naturally occurring nutrients in tomatoes. Lycopene, the main tomato carotenoid, contributes to this effect, but its role per se remains to be investigated.",Basu A; Imrhan V,European journal of clinical nutrition,2006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16929242/,1,0,0,0,0,0

16841860,n-3 fatty acids and the metabolic syndrome.,"The metabolic syndrome is defined as the coexistence of 3 or more components, some of which indicate alterations in glucose and lipid metabolism. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is rapidly increasing in relation to obesity, and it is considered to be an important predictor of cardiovascular disease. Increased intakes or supplements of n-3 marine fatty acids may improve defects in insulin signaling and prevent alterations in glucose homeostasis and the further development of type 2 diabetes. This is largely mediated through a reduction in fatty acid accumulation in muscle and liver. n-3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) reduce plasma triacylglycerols and improve the lipoprotein profile by decreasing the fraction of atherogenic small, dense LDL. However, n-3 PUFAs do not lower LDL cholesterol. These effects are likely mediated through the activity of transcription factors relating to expression of genes involved in lipid oxidation and synthesis. Other pleiotrophic effects of n-3 PUFAs may contribute to decreasing the burden of the metabolic syndrome, such as modulating inflammation, platelet activation, endothelial function, and blood pressure. Although studies comparing the effect of both major n-3 PUFAs are limited, docosahexaenoic acid appears at least as efficient as eicosapentaenoic acid in correcting several risk factors. The use of n-3 PUFAs should be considered in more global strategies including changes in lifestyle, such as adhering to a healthy Mediterranean type of diet and practicing regular physical exercise.",Carpentier YA; Portois L; Malaisse WJ,The American journal of clinical nutrition,2006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16841860/,1,0,0,0,0,0
16787199,Dietary small molecules and large-scale gene expression studies: an experimental approach for understanding their beneficial effects on the development of malignant and non-malignant proliferative diseases.,"Epidemiological studies have repeatedly demonstrated a correlation between nutrition, development and the severity of malignant and non-malignant proliferative diseases such as cancer and atherosclerosis. Therefore, the prevention of chronic proliferative diseases through dietary intervention is currently receiving considerable attention. Until now, much of the research is being focused on the cellular and molecular action mechanisms of dietary small molecules explaining their beneficial effects. Dietary chemicals may affect gene expression in several human diseases. However, significant progress has been made and several molecular action mechanisms have been proposed. Alteration of genetical pathways by nutrition, also called ""Nutrigenomics"", may offer a new approach for understanding the beneficial effects of dietary compounds on the development of severe polygenic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and hypertension. This review focuses on the nutritional genomics of dietary chemicals with a special emphasis on catechins. Catechins belong to the flavonoid family, which are polyphenolic compounds available in foods of plant origin. Several epidemiological studies have reported that consumption of flavonoids, and especially catechins might function as chemopreventive agents against cancer and cardiovascular diseases.",Mariappan D; Winkler J; Parthiban V; Doss MX; Hescheler J; Sachinidis A,Current medicinal chemistry,2006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16787199/,1,0,0,0,0,0
16782527,Cystic fibrosis: nutritional consequences and management.,"Life expectancy for patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) has steadily improved during the last three decades, and death in childhood is now uncommon. Nutrition is a critical component of the management of CF, and nutritional status is directly associated with both pulmonary status and survival. Expert dietetic care is necessary, and attention must be given to ensuring an adequate energy intake in the face of demands which may be increased by inadequately controlled malabsorption, chronic broncho-pulmonary colonisation by bacteria and fungi, exacerbations of acute lung infection, impaired lung function, and the need for rehabilitation, repair and growth. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) is needed by up to 90% of CF patients in Northern Europe, where the 'severe' mutation deltaF508 predominates, but a smaller proportion in Mediterranean countries and elsewhere, because pancreatic insufficiency is one of few features of CF which correlate with genotype. Complications of CF including liver disease and CF-related diabetes pose further challenges. In addition, deficiency of specific nutrients including fat soluble vitamins (particularly A, E and K) essential fatty acids and occasionally minerals occur for a variety of reasons. Osteopenia is common and poorly understood. Liver disease increases the likelihood of vitamin D deficiency. Glucose intolerance and diabetes affect at least 25% of CF adults, and the diabetes differs from both types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus, but it inversely correlates with prognosis. Management consists of anticipating problems and addressing them vigorously as soon as they appear. Supplements of vitamins are routinely given. Energy supplements can be oral, enteral or, rarely, parenteral. All supplements, including PERT, are adjusted to individual needs.",Dodge JA; Turck D,Best practice & research.

16632171,Zinc requirements and the risks and benefits of zinc supplementation.,"The adult human contains 2-3g of zinc, about 0.1% of which are replenished daily. On this basis and based on estimates of bioavailability of zinc, dietary recommendations are made for apparently healthy individuals. Absent chemical, functional, and/or physical signs of zinc deficiency are assumed indicative of adequacy. More specific data are seldom available. Changing food preferences and availability, and new food preparation, preservation, and processing technologies may require re-evaluation of past data. Conservative estimates suggest that 25% of the world's population is at risk of zinc deficiency. Most of the affected are poor, and rarely consume foods rich in highly bioavailable zinc, while subsisting on foods that are rich in inhibitors of zinc absorption and/or contain relatively small amounts of bioavailable zinc. In contrast, among the relatively affluent, food choice is a major factor affecting risk of zinc deficiency. An additional problem, especially among the relatively affluent, is risk of chronic zinc toxicity caused by excessive consumption of zinc supplements. High intakes of zinc relative to copper can cause copper deficiency. A major challenge that has not been resolved for maximum health benefit is the proximity of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) and the reference dose (RfD) for safe intake of zinc. Present recommendations do not consider the numerous dietary factors that influence the bioavailability of zinc and copper, and the likelihood of toxicity from zinc supplements. Thus the current assumed range between safe and unsafe intakes of zinc is relatively narrow. At present, assessment of zinc nutriture is complex, involving a number of chemical and functional measurements that have limitations in sensitivity and specificity. This approach needs to be enhanced so that zinc deficiency or excess can be detected early. An increasing number of associations between diseases and zinc status and apparently normal states of health, where additional zinc might be efficacious to prevent certain conditions, point at the pharmacology of zinc compounds as a promising area. For example, relationships between zinc and diabetes mellitus are an area where research might prove fruitful. In our opinion, a multidisciplinary approach will most likely result in success in this fertile area for translational research.",Maret W; Sandstead HH,Journal of trace elements in medicine and biology : organ of the Society for Minerals and Trace Elements (GMS),2006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16632171/,1,0,0,0,0,0
16625532,Antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements for slowing the progression of age-related macular degeneration.,"It has been proposed that antioxidants may prevent cellular damage in the retina by reacting with free radicals that are produced in the process of light absorption. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplementation, or both, on the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2005, Issue 4); MEDLINE (1966 to January 2006); SIGLE (1980 to March 2005); EMBASE (1980 to January 2005); NRR (2005, Issue 4); AMED (1985 to January 2006); and PubMed (24 January 2006 covering last 60 days), reference lists of identified reports and the Science Citation Index. We contacted investigators and experts in the field for details of unpublished studies. We included randomised trials comparing antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplemention (alone or in combination) to a control intervention in people with AMD. The author extracted data and assessed trial quality. Where appropriate, data were pooled using a random-effects model unless three or fewer trials were available in which case a fixed-effects model was used. Eight trials were included in this review. The majority of people were randomised in one trial (AREDS in the USA) that found a beneficial effect of antioxidant (beta-carotene, vitamin C and vitamin E) and zinc supplementation on progression to advanced AMD (adjusted odds ratio 0.68, 99% confidence interval 0.49 to 0.93). People taking supplements were less likely to lose 15 or more letters of visual acuity (adjusted odds ratio 0.77, 99% confidence interval 0.58 to 1.03). Hospitalisation for genito-urinary problems was more common in people taking zinc and yellowing of skin was more common in people taking antioxidants. The other trials were, in general, small and the results were inconsistent. The evidence as to the effectiveness of antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplementation in halting the progression of AMD comes mainly from one large trial in the USA. The generalisability of these findings to other populations with different nutritional status is not known. Further large, well-conducted randomised controlled trials in other populations are required. Long-term harm from supplementation cannot be ruled out. Beta-carotene has been found to increase the risk of lung cancer in smokers; vitamin E has been associated with an increased risk of heart failure in people with vascular disease or diabetes.",Evans JR,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16625532/,0,1,0,1,0,0
16611166,"Role of antioxidants, essential fatty acids, carnitine, vitamins, phytochemicals and trace elements in the treatment of diabetes mellitus and its chronic complications.","Nowadays, the treatment of diabetes mellitus is based on the variable use and combination of diet, antidiabetic oral agents (metformin, sulphanylureas, glynides, acarbose and thiazolidinediones) and insulin or its analogs, depending on the type of diabetes and the needs of the patient. The prevention and treatment of chronic micro- and macrovascular complications, on the other hand, is based on the achievement and maintenance of an optimal glycaemic control and requires the combined use of adjunctive therapy such as antihypertensive drugs and cholesterol-lowering medications. Furthermore, several herbal preparations and dietary supplements, such as antioxidants, essential fatty acids, lipid metabolism activators, vitamins and trace elements, are advertised and prescribed to patients as a useful adjuvant to a diabetic diet and conventional medications in order to improve glycaemic control and reduce the impact of chronic complications.

16600341,Vitamin D and disease prevention with special reference to cardiovascular disease.,"Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is the hallmark for determining vitamin D status. Serum parathyroid hormone [PTH] increases progressively when 25(OH)D falls below 75 nmol/l. Concentrations of 25(OH)D below 50 nmol/l or even below 25 nmol/l are frequently observed in various population groups throughout the world. This paper highlights the relationship of vitamin D insufficiency with cardiovascular disease and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, two diseases that account for up to 50% of all deaths in western countries. There is evidence from patients with end-stage renal disease that high PTH concentrations are causally related to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Activated vitamin D is able to increase survival in this patient group significantly. Moreover, already slightly enhanced PTH concentrations are associated with ventricular hypertrophy and coronary heart disease in the general population. Experimental studies have demonstrated that a lack of vitamin D action leads to hypertension in mice. Some intervention trials have also shown that vitamin D can reduce blood pressure in hypertensive patients. In young and elderly adults, serum 25(OH)D is inversely correlated with blood glucose concentrations and insulin resistance. Sun-deprived lifestyle, resulting in low cutaneous vitamin D synthesis, is the major factor for an insufficient vitamin D status. Unfortunately, vitamin D content of most foods is negligible. Moreover, fortified foods and over-the-counter supplements usually contain inadequate amounts of vitamin D to increase serum 25(OH)D to 75 nmol/l. As a consequence, legislation has to be changed to allow higher amounts of vitamin D in fortified foods and supplements.",Zittermann A,Progress in biophysics and molecular biology,2006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16600341/,1,0,0,0,0,0

16528676,Conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) and white adipose tissue: how both in vitro and in vivo studies tell the story of a relationship.,"The distribution of adipose tissue in mammals is dependent on genetic and environmental factors, and in health the fundamental role of adipocytes is to store triacylglycerol during energetic excess and to mobilize this reserve during energy expenditure or reduced food intake. This requires an accurate balance, which is maintained through the interactions of several regulatory factors, as well as dietary manipulations. Dietary supplementation with CLAs (conjugated linoleic acids) is regarded as promising in many mammalian species for obtaining good body mass repartition and diminution of fat depots. CLAs are a group of positional and geometric isomers of conjugated dienoic derivatives of linoleic acid, naturally present in foods originating from ruminant species, and normally present in human adipose tissue. CLAs can, however, also be obtained as commercial supplements, usually containing synthetically prepared isomeric mixtures, and as dietary supplements CLAs are widely used by obese people, above all in the USA and Europe. CLAs are claimed to have protective effects against human degenerative pathologies, such as cancer, atherosclerosis, and diabetes, as well as showing beneficial effects on immune functions and food and energy intakes. The mechanisms of action of CLAs are not fully clarified at present, because in vitro and in vivo studies are not always in agreement, and possibly because CLAs act in different ways and with different consequences when administered in the diet to different species. The present review summarizes the ascertained mechanisms of action of CLAs, the mammalian species of major interest in which important studies have been conducted, and the future prospects for the use of CLAs in both humans and food animal species. The following topics will be discussed, taking evidence from both in vitro and in vivo studies, to provide a possible rationale for the therapeutic or dietary utilization of CLAs: decreased energy/food intake, increased energy expenditure, decreased pre-adipocyte differentiation and proliferation, and increased apoptosis of adipocytes. All of these parameters, in turn, affect decreased lipogenesis and increased lipolysis. For the future, interactions with individual hormonal substrates, changes in gene expression of proteins involved in lipid metabolism, and anti-tumorigenic effects will possibly constitute areas for scientific development and deepening of knowledge of dietary CLAs.",Domeneghini C; Di Giancamillo A; Corino C,Histology and histopathology,2006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16528676/,1,0,0,0,0,0
16464680,"Nutritional factors, cognitive decline, and dementia.","Nutritional factors and nutritional deficiencies have been repeatedly associated with cognitive impairment. Most of the evidence is based on cross-sectional studies, which cannot prove whether a nutritional deficit is the cause or the consequence of an impaired cognitive status. In fact, cognitive impairment, in turn, can determine changes in dietary habits and consequent nutritional deficiencies. We reviewed clinical and epidemiological studies from January 1983 to June 2004. Several cross-sectional and fewer prospective studies reported an association between dietary or supplemental intake of antioxidants and protection from cognitive decline and dementia. There are negative reports as well and some methodological biases might have affected the consistencies across studies. Deficiencies of several B vitamins have been associated with cognitive dysfunction in many observational studies. More recently, deficiencies of folate (B9) and cobalamine (B12) have been studied in relation to hyperhomocysteinemia as potential determinants of cognitive impairment, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). A small number of studies assessed the association between intake of macronutrients and cognitive function or dementia. Among the others, the intake of fatty acids and cholesterol has received particular attention. Although the results are not always consistent, most studies have reported a protective role of dietary intakes of poly- and mono-unsaturated fatty acids against cognitive decline and AD.

16444816,Taurine supplementation and diabetes mellitus.,"Taurine is a semi-essential sulphur amino acid derived from methionine and cysteine metabolism. It has been evaluated either in experimental or clinical type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance. One form of experiment has included the possibility that perinatal taurine administration could prevent diabetes mellitus and/or insulin resistance. Experimental data suggest strongly that taurine could have beneficial effects in type 1 diabetes mellitus, and could generally reduce organ lipid peroxidation and plasma lipids. Interestingly, retina, lens and nerves seem to respond better to taurine than other organs such as kidneys. It has been shown in some experimental models that in type 2 diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance there is alteration in taurine homeostasis. Taurine could prevent the onset of diabetes mellitus in NOD mice and postnatal taurine modifies the glucose-loading curves in adults. However, the clinical studies are too small and too short to have any real significance. Further experimental and clinical studies are required to evaluate taurine's possible therapeutic potential.

Recent studies have revealed that mitogen-activated protein kinases as intracellular signaling factors are involved in hyperglycemia-induced embryopathy. Based on the findings, interventions to prevent embryonic malformations have been explored. Strategies include supplementation of molecules that are deficient in the embryos under hyperglycemic conditions and antioxidants to alleviate the adverse effects of oxidative stress.

16313693,Could antioxidant supplementation prevent pre-eclampsia?,"Pre-eclampsia is a disorder characterised by pregnancy-induced hypertension and new-onset proteinuria occurring in the second half of pregnancy. Worldwide, approximately 2-3% of all pregnant women develop pre-eclampsia. The condition is a major cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Abnormal placentation is an important predisposing factor for pre-eclampsia, while endothelial activation appears to be central to the pathophysiological changes, possibly indicative of a two-stage disorder characterised by reduced placental perfusion and a maternal syndrome. There is increasing evidence that pre-eclampsia is associated with both increased oxidative stress and reduced antioxidant defences, which has led to the hypothesis that oxidative stress may play an important role in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia, perhaps acting as the link in a two-stage model of pre-eclampsia. In support of this hypothesis a small, but important, preliminary study has shown a highly significant (P=0.02) reduction in the incidence of pre-eclampsia in women at risk who were taking a supplement of vitamins C and E from mid-pregnancy. Furthermore, these findings support the hypothesis that oxidative stress is at least partly responsible for the endothelial dysfunction of pre-eclampsia. Several larger multicentre trials are currently underway to evaluate the efficacy, safety and cost benefits of antioxidant supplementation during pregnancy for the prevention of pre-eclampsia in both low- and high-risk women, including women with diabetes.

16230278,[Arginine and statins: relationship between the nitric oxide pathway and the atherosclerosis development].,"Arginine, a semi-essential amino acid, plays a major nutritional and metabolic role. In particular, arginine is the precursor of nitric oxide which is involved in the endothelial function. Several factors, such as hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, ageing and hypertension are established risk factors for atherosclerosis, in particular by decreasing the availability of nitric oxide. Thus, endothelial nitric oxide synthase has a pivotal role against atherosclerosis. A suitable amount of cofactor and a sufficient intake of arginine have been shown to modulate nitric oxide-induced vasodilatation: despite the fact that the intracellular concentration of arginine is well above the Km of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, an arginine supplemented-diet is effective in increasing the production of nitric oxide. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this ""arginine paradox"": co-localization of the arginine transporter with endothelial nitric oxide synthase, intracellular arginine regeneration from citrulline, balance between endothelial arginase and nitric oxide synthase. Statins which are HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors inhibit the synthesis of mevalonate, and thus that of cholesterol. In addition, statins increase the stabilization of endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA. The co-operation between cholesterol synthesis and the upregulation of caveolin-1 on the one hand, and the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase on the other hand, is very tight. A depletion of cholesterol in the caveolae induces a decrease in caveolin-1 at the cell surface allowing NOS activation. Thus statins improve nitric oxide production and vasodilatation. In a recent work in the hypercholesterolemic Watanabe rabbit, we have demonstrated that the combination of arginine with a statin, namely atorvastatin, significantly hinders the spreading of atherosclerotic plaques as compared with monotherapies.

16158224,Zinc and the diabetic heart.,"Zinc (Zn) is an essential mineral that is required for various cellular functions. Its abnormal metabolism is related to certain disorders such as diabetic complications. Oxidative stress has been considered as the major causative factor for diabetic cardiomyopathy. Zn has a critical antioxidant action in protecting the heart from various oxidative stresses. Zn deficiency was found to be a risk factor for cardiac oxidative damage and supplementation with Zn provides a significant prevention of oxidative damage to the heart. Diabetes causes a significant systemic oxidative stress and also often is accompanied by Zn deficiency that increases the susceptibility of the heart to oxidative damage. Therefore, there is a strong rationale to consider the strategy of Zn supplementation to prevent or delay diabetic cardiomyopathy. This short article collects the preliminary evidence, based on our own studies and those by others, for a preventive effect of Zn supplementation on diabetes-induced injury to the heart in animals and under in vitro conditions. Possible mechanisms by which Zn supplementation prevents diabetic heart disease are discussed. They include an antioxidant action of Zn, insulin function and metallothionein induction. In the final section, the future of Zn supplementation for diabetic patients is also briefly discussed. Although Zn supplementation has not been clinically used to prevent diabetic complications, because several issues need to be addressed, the fact that Zn supplementation is being used clinically for other disorders encourages us to explore its direct clinical application for the prevention of diabetic cardiomyopathy.",Song Y; Wang J; Li XK; Cai L,"Biometals : an international journal on the role of metal ions in biology, biochemistry, and medicine",2005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16158224/,1,0,0,0,0,0

A total of 23 studies (comprising 784 patients) of oral supplements (16 studies) and tube feeding (7 studies) were included in the review, and the majority compared diabetes-specific with standard formulas. Compared with standard formulas, diabetes-specific formulas significantly reduced postprandial rise in blood glucose (by 1.03 mmol/l [95% CI 0.58-1.47]; six randomized controlled trials [RCTs]), peak blood glucose concentration (by 1.59 mmol/l [86-2.32]; two RCTs), and glucose area under curve (by 7.96 mmol.l(-1).min(-1) [2.25-13.66]; four RCTs, i.e., by 35%) with no significant effect on HDL, total cholesterol, or triglyceride concentrations. In addition, individual studies reported a reduced requirement for insulin (26-71% lower) and fewer complications with diabetes-specific compared with standard nutritional formulas. This systematic review shows that short- and long-term use of diabetes-specific formulas as oral supplements and tube feeds are associated with improved glycemic control compared with standard formulas. If such nutritional support is given long term, this may have implications for reducing chronic complications of diabetes, such as cardiovascular events.",Elia M; Ceriello A; Laube H; Sinclair AJ; Engfer M; Stratton RJ,Diabetes care,2005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16123506/,0,1,0,1,0,0
16081237,A review on the role of antioxidants in the management of diabetes and its complications.,"Diabetes is a prevalent systemic disease affecting a significant proportion of the population worldwide. The effects of diabetes are devastating and well documented. There is increasing evidence that in certain pathologic states, especially chronic diseases, the increased production and/or ineffective scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may play a critical role. High reactivity of ROS determines chemical changes in virtually all cellular components, leading to lipid peroxidation. Production of ROS and disturbed capacity of antioxidant defense in diabetic subjects have been reported. It has been suggested that enhanced production of free radicals and oxidative stress is central event to the development of diabetic complications. This suggestion has been supported by demonstration of increased levels of indicators of oxidative stress in diabetic individuals suffering from complications. Therefore, it seems reasonable that antioxidants can play an important role in the improvement of diabetes. There are many reports on effects of antioxidants in the management of diabetes. In this paper, after complete bibliography and criticizing all relevant articles, the relationships between diabetes and oxidative stress and use of antioxidants in the management of diabetes and its complications have been well reviewed. This review well indicates that oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications. Use of antioxidants reduces oxidative stress and alleviates diabetic complications.",Rahimi R; Nikfar S; Larijani B; Abdollahi M,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16081237/,1,0,0,0,0,0
16077258,Latest advances in antiaging medicine.,"Rapid progress is being made in our ability to modify the aging process. Rather than serving as a period of debility and decreasing health, for many people, the later years of life are becoming a period of continued productivity, independence and good health. Progress is also being made in increasing average lifespan. The leading causes of death (cardiovascular disease, cancer, lung disease, diabetes) are the end result of decades-long processes. With current knowledge, it is possible to delay the onset of these diseases. This can be assisted by lifestyle choices incorporating healthful diet, exercise, stress management, and nutritional supplementation. Emerging genomics technology will allow individuals to establish personalized programs, while early detection of heart disease and cancer will contribute to longevity. Biotechnological therapies involving stem cells, recombinant DNA, proteomics, therapeutic cloning and gene-based therapies are expected to play major roles in promoting successful aging. We are at the threshold of artificial intelligence (AI) and nanotechnology (NT). AI will allow for a merging of our biological thinking with advanced forms of non-biological intelligence to vastly expand our ability to think, create and experience. NT will ultimately allow us to build devices able to build molecules much like our current cellular machinery does, one atom at a time. It is the goal of today's antiaging medicine to forestall disease and aging long enough for people to utilize the powerful biotechnology and nanotechnology therapies that will be developed over the decades ahead. These future therapies have the potential to greatly extend longevity.",Grossman T,The Keio journal of medicine,2005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16077258/,1,0,0,0,0,0
15926145,"Dietary fibre, glycaemic response, and diabetes.","The much publicised global trend in rising levels of obesity and diabetes has refuelled interest in the dietary intake of the macronutrients (fat, protein, and carbohydrates) necessary to maintain the state of normalcy (good health) of an individual. Both scientific and public attention have focused on the dietary mediation of chronic health syndromes, either through use of dietary supplements, or a review of the whole diet situation. Dietary supplements have been used extensively both as pharmacological supplements, food ingredients, in processed foods to aid weight control, and the regulation of glucose control for diabetic patients. Particular interest has focused on the use of dietary fibres, especially soluble dietary fibres (such as guar gum, locust bean gum, and psyllium fibres), resistant starch, and slowly digestible carbohydrates. These have been shown to alter food structure, texture, and viscosity, and hence the rate of starch degradation during digestion. Research has also illustrated an association between the rate of carbohydrate degradation during digestion, and the regulation of postprandial blood sugar and insulin levels. The current paper explores the potential use of dietary fibres in the treatment of obesity and diabetes.",Brennan CS,Molecular nutrition & food research,2005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15926145/,1,0,0,0,0,0
15884793,Hypoxia inducible factor pathways as targets for functional foods.,"The etiology of most chronic angiogenic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, diabetes complications, and cancer includes the presence of pockets of hypoxic cells growing behind aerobic cells and away from blood vessels. Hypoxic cells are the result of uncontrolled growth and insufficient vascularization and have undergone a shift from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism. Cells respond to hypoxia by stimulating the expression of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), which is critical for survival under hypoxic conditions and in embryogenesis. HIF is a heterodimer consisting of the O2-regulated subunit, HIF-1alpha, and the constitutively expressed aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator, HIF-1beta. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1alpha is stable, accumulates, and migrates to the nucleus where it binds to HIF-1beta to form the complex (HIF-1alpha + HIF-1beta). Transcription is initiated by the binding of the complex (HIF-1alpha + HIF-1beta) to hypoxia responsive elements (HREs). The complex [(HIF-1alpha + HIF-1beta) + HREs] stimulates the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis, anaerobic metabolism, vascular permeability, and inflammation. Experimental and clinical evidence show that these hypoxic cells are the most aggressive and difficult angiogenic disease cells to treat and are a major reason for antiangiogenic and conventional treatment failure. Hypoxia occurs in early stages of disease development (before metastasis), activates angiogenesis, and stimulates vascular remodeling. HIF-1alpha has also been identified under aerobic conditions in certain types of cancer. This review summarizes the role of hypoxia in some chronic degenerative angiogenic diseases and discusses potential functional foods to target the HIF-1alpha pathways under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. It is reported that dietary quinones, semiquinones, phenolics, vitamins, amino acids, isoprenoids, and vasoactive compounds can down-regulate the HIF-1 pathways and therefore the expression of several proangiogenic factors. Considering the lack of efficiency or the side effects of synthetic antiangiogenic drugs at clinical trials, down-regulation of hypoxia-induced angiogenesis by use of naturally occurring functional foods may provide an effective means of prevention.",Losso JN; Bawadi HA,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15884793/,1,0,0,0,0,0
15864078,Does fish oil supplementation in pregnancy reduce the risk of allergic disease in infants?,"Parallel increases in many inflammatory diseases over the last 40 years suggest that common environmental changes are promoting inflammatory immune responses and/or inhibiting the processes that normally keep these in check. One key change during this period has been declining intakes of anti-inflammatory dietary factors, including omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA). As allergic diseases often first manifest in early infancy, prevention strategies need to be targeted early, even in utero. This review will examine recent evidence for the use of fish oil during this early period as a primary prevention strategy for allergic disease. N-3 PUFA have well documented anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and have also been demonstrated to have health benefits in a range of chronic inflammatory diseases, including cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes, supporting their role in modulating inflammation in vivo. Although the effects of fish oil supplementation in established allergic disease are less convincing, there is accumulating evidence that dietary n-3 PUFA may have greater effects before allergic responses are established. Supplementation of the maternal diet in pregnancy with n-3 PUFA may provide a non-invasive intervention with significant potential to prevent the development of allergic and possibly other immune-mediated diseases.",Dunstan JA; Prescott SL,Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,2005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15864078/,1,0,0,0,0,0
15850229,Nutrition assessment in HIV infection.,"Nutrition assessment is a vital component of the general care of HIV-infected adults. With access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV infection may become a chronic, manageable disease. Nutritional and metabolic complications traditionally associated with HIV infection such as hypertriglyceridemia, low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and weight loss continue to occur. However, emerging abnormalities such as regional alterations in body shape (fat re-distribution syndrome or HIV-associated lipodystrophy), increasing body weight, high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, insulin resistance, and other metabolic derangements may also be present. In addition, as patients are living longer, they may be susceptible to other age-related diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. In this article, we review strategies for nutrition assessment and management in HIV-infected adults. Attention is focused on specific symptoms such as weight loss and diarrhea and specific disorders such as lipodystrophy, micronutrient deficiencies, and dyslipidemia, which commonly affect HIV-infected individuals. Proper attention to nutritional status may help to reduce the burden of disease and promote an enhanced quality of life in HIV-infected individuals.",Gerrior JL; Neff LM,Nutrition in clinical care : an official publication of Tufts University,2005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15850229/,1,0,0,0,0,0
15806791,Vitamin C: from popular food supplement to specific drug.,"The daily requirement of a human person for vitamin C (ascorbic acid) has now been established at 100 mg. This value was already on the map when Arnold Durig put together the most important needs of nutritional ingredients. The modern value rests on the saturating level of ascorbate in leukocytes, which is in the millimolar range. The mechanism of accumulation of ascorbate in these cells rests on the uptake of oxidized dehydroascorbic acid. It is very efficient and avoids loss of vitamin which occurs in vitro when ascorbate is oxidized because of the great instability of the dehydro form. Therefore and increased requirement in case of infection is very unlikely from the biochemical point of view. However, low concentrations of ascorbate are found in patients suffering from arterial diseases or diseases accompanied by arterial damage such as diabetes mellitus. Ascorbate is known as a protection factor for the arterial endothel, but it is not clear by what mechanism this protection is brought about. Moreover, under clinical conditions very high concentrations are needed, which are achieved only by intravenous infusion, and the protection is only observed when the disease is manifest, not in healthy people. Therefore, also in this respect an increase in daily intake seems of no prophylactic value. Thus, by using high concentrations of ascorbate as an i.v. drug, effects of this substance frequently observed in vitro, could be used for therapy. This includes not only treatment of arterial diseases, but also relates to the cytotoxic effects of the vitamin against certain tumor cells and may assist conventional chemotherapy.",Goldenberg H,Forum of nutrition,2003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15806791/,1,0,0,0,0,0

15672469,Peripheral diabetic neuropathy and polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementations: natural sources or biotechnological needs?,"The two essential fatty acids linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids, precursors of the n-6 and n-3 PUFA family, respectively, are known to play a strong regulatory function on cells via their incorporation into membrane phospholipids, and also on microcirculation by the production of eicosanoids. Moreover, diabetes mellitus induces impairment in PUFA metabolism due to an inhibition of desaturases, the enzymes involved in their synthesis. The decrease in PUFA bioavailability will conduct to marked alterations in membranes as well as impairment of the microcirculation. Those metabolic perturbations are involved in part in the degenerative complications of diabetes such as neuropathy. Nutritional supplementations with PUFA have given very interesting results in experimental diabetic neuropathy but also in human diabetic neuropathy. The gamma linolenic and arachidonic acids, members of the n-6 family, prevent the physiological abnormalities associated to neuropathy. The results obtained with the n-3 family PUFA are more discordant, probably because of the simultaneous use of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids. Nevertheless, the use of docosahexaenoic acid-enriched phospholipids produced positive results in the treatment of experimental diabetic neuropathy. These PUFA are available from natural sources but a biotechnological demand exists to provide these PUFA in different structural forms.",Coste TC; Gerbi A; Vague P; Maixent JM; Pieroni G; Raccah D,"Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)",2004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15672469/,1,0,0,0,0,0
15671235,Vitamin D in type 1 diabetes prevention.,"Limited data from human observational studies suggest that early supplementation with 10 microg/d (400 IU/d) or less of vitamin D may not reduce the risk for type 1 diabetes but that doses of 50 microg/d (2000 IU/d) and higher may have a strong protective effect. Current U.S. recommendations (5-25 microg/d, 200-1000 IU/d) fall in the largely unstudied dose range in between. All infants and children should receive between 5 microg/d and 25 microg/d of supplemental vitamin D, particularly if they have limited sun exposure, live in northern areas, are exclusively breastfed, or are dark skinned. Caretakers of infants and children at increased risk of type 1 diabetes might wish to consider supplementation toward the upper end of that range or above. Additional studies are needed that 1) investigate the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D and autoantibodies predictive of type 1 diabetes in infancy and beyond, 2) test the ability of vitamin D supplement doses between 5 and 50 microg/d to prevent autoantibodies and/or type 1 diabetes in infancy and beyond, and 3) examine the safety of vitamin D intakes of 25 microg/d and higher. Also, we need to consider the possible benefits of vitamin D supplementation when deciding whether or not to screen children for type 1 diabetes risk and to add type 1 diabetes to the growing list of outcomes that are considered when vitamin D recommendations are next revised.",Harris SS,The Journal of nutrition,2005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15671235/,1,0,0,0,0,0
15671233,Vitamin D intake: a global perspective of current status.,"Global high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and re-emergence of rickets and the growing scientific evidence linking low circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D to increased risk of osteoporosis, diabetes, cancer, and autoimmune disorders have stimulated recommendations to increase sunlight (UVB) exposure as a source of vitamin D. However, concern over increased risk of melanoma with unprotected UVB exposure has led to the alternative recommendation that sufficient vitamin D should be supplied through dietary sources alone. Here, we examine the adequacy of vitamin D intake worldwide and evaluate the ability of current fortification policies and supplement use practices among various countries to meet this recommendation. It is evident from our review that vitamin D intake is often too low to sustain healthy circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in countries without mandatory staple food fortification, such as with milk and margarine. Even in countries that do fortify, vitamin D intakes are low in some groups due to their unique dietary patterns, such as low milk consumption, vegetarian diet, limited use of dietary supplements, or loss of traditional high fish intakes. Our global review indicates that dietary supplement use may contribute 6-47% of the average vitamin D intake in some countries. Recent studies demonstrate safety and efficacy of community-based vitamin D supplementation trials and food staple fortification introduced in countries without fortification policies. Reliance on the world food supply as an alternative to UVB exposure will necessitate greater availability of fortified food staples, dietary supplement use, and/or change in dietary patterns to consume more fish.",Calvo MS; Whiting SJ; Barton CN,The Journal of nutrition,2005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15671233/,1,0,0,0,0,0
15666575,What do herbalists suggest to diabetic patients in order to improve glycemic control? Evaluation of scientific evidence and potential risks.,"In the course of 12 continuing education seminars given in different regions of Italy in 2001, we distributed a questionnaire to all the attending herbalists asking information about the herbal remedy and dietary supplement they mainly recommended to subjects who required a ""natural"" treatment to control glycemia. We distributed 720 questionnaires and we received 685 completed ones. We have compiled a short review on the efficacy and safety of the 10 most frequently advised products for each category. The 10 more frequently suggested herbal remedies were gymnema, psyllium, fenugreek, bilberry, garlic, Chinese ginseng, dandelion, burdock, prickly pear cactus, and bitter melon. The 10 most frequently recommended dietary supplements were biotin, vanadium, chromium, vitamin B6, vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, selenium, alpha-lipoic acid, and fructooligosaccharides. The majority of the products recommended by Italian herbalists may be efficacious in reducing glycemia. If a diabetic patient is already assuming products that even slightly reduce glycemia, we risk to underestimate the level of glucose intolerance, while if the patient stops the complementary treatment after initiating pharmaceutical therapy, in the subsequent visit we may underestimate the effect of our prescription. Therefore, if doctors are to have a role in gate-keeping or advising patients about complementary and alternative medicine, they need to be familiar with this type of medicine. If they choose otherwise, then the provision of complementary and alternative medicine will continue to be patchy and largely outside the conventional care framework, perhaps through a growing network of parallel care providers involving a large number of non-medically qualified practitioners, who patients will continue to access directly.",Cicero AF; Derosa G; Gaddi A,Acta diabetologica,2004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15666575/,1,0,0,0,0,0

15256611,Coenzyme Q10 and diabetic endotheliopathy: oxidative stress and the 'recoupling hypothesis'.,"Increased oxidative stress in diabetes mellitus may underlie the development of endothelial cell dysfunction by decreasing the availability of nitric oxide (NO) as well as by activating pro-inflammatory pathways. In the arterial wall, redox imbalance and oxidation of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) uncouples endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). This results in decreased production and increased consumption of NO, and generation of free radicals, such as superoxide and peroxynitrite. In the mitochondria, increased redox potential uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in inhibition of electron transport and increased transfer of electrons to molecular oxygen to form superoxide and other oxidant radicals. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ), a potent antioxidant and a critical intermediate of the electron transport chain, may improve endothelial dysfunction by 'recoupling' eNOS and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.

15159251,Insulin resistance-associated cardiovascular disease: potential benefits of conjugated linoleic acid.,"Type 2 diabetes and associated cardiovascular disease have reached global epidemic proportions. Recent data from the World Health Organization Multinational Study of Vascular Disease in Diabetes indicate that cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality (52% of deaths) in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Although insulin resistance plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes-related cardiovascular disease, other related risk factors often cluster in a single patient; the combination of insulin resistance and these risk factors is known as the metabolic syndrome. According to the World Health Organization definition, this constellation of risk factors includes hypertension, elevated plasma triacylglycerol, reduced HDL cholesterol, central obesity, and microalbuminuria. The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial showed that, although diabetes or insulin resistance is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease mortality, these other components of the metabolic syndrome confer additive risk. Thus, to effectively address cardiovascular disease in persons with diabetes, intervention would ideally target all these factors. Conjugated linoleic acid could represent a candidate agent. The therapeutic potential of conjugated linoleic acid against insulin resistance-associated cardiovascular disease is discussed on the basis of the reported effects of conjugated linoleic acid on individual components of the metabolic syndrome.",Aminot-Gilchrist DV; Anderson HD,The American journal of clinical nutrition,2004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15159251/,1,0,0,0,0,0

15104204,Isoprostanes: novel bioactive products of lipid peroxidation.,"Isoprostanes, are a novel group of prostaglandin-like compounds that are biosynthesised from esterified polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) through a non-enzymatic free radical-catalysed reaction. Several of these compounds possess potent biological activity, as evidenced mainly through their pulmonary and renal vasoconstrictive effects, and have short half-lives. It has been shown that isoprostanes act as full or partial agonists through thromboxane receptors. Both human and experimental studies have indicated associations of isoprostanes and severe inflammatory conditions, ischemia-reperfusion, diabetes and atherosclerosis. Reports have shown that F2-isoprostanes are authentic biomarkers of lipid peroxidation and can be used as potential in vivo indicators of oxidant stress in various clinical conditions, as well as in evaluations of antioxidants or drugs for their free radical-scavenging properties. Higher levels of F2-isoprostanes have been found in the normal human pregnancy compared to non-pregnancy, but their physiological role has not been well studied so far. Since bioactive F2-isoprostanes are continuously formed in various tissues and large amounts of these potent compounds are found unmetabolised in their free acid form in the urine in normal basal conditions with a wide inter-individual variation, their role in the regulation of normal physiological functions could be of further biological interest, but has yet to be disclosed.

Recently published clinical and pharmaceutical industry literature. By the authors. By the authors. Last year witnessed the first effort of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to remove a dietary supplement from the U.S. market. Ephedra, because of its imminent danger when used for weight reduction and athletic enhancement, was the target of FDA action. FDA has issued a final rule implementing this ban, which prohibits the sale of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids (e.g., ephedra). Two newer diet-aid products are being actively promoted with little or no safety and effectiveness data. Thus, pharmacist's vigilance is important along with sensible advice on how to lose weight safely and effectively. Further, two independent organizations have created certification programs for dietary supplements that ensure product purity, active ingredient strength, and compliance with good manufacturing practices. In addition, through recent changes in federal legislation, consumers are now able to obtain reimbursement for their nonprescription purchases through flexible spending accounts. Information is presented in this article about selected products in these OTC, home care, and dietary supplement categories: heartburn (proton pump inhibitors), allergy (second-generation antihistamines), constipation (laxatives), diabetes mellitus (blood glucose monitoring systems), home testing (fertility monitoring), nicotine addiction (smoking cessation products), otic disorders (ear syringes), contraceptives and sexual aids (condoms and lubricants), and dermatology (wart removal). Patients continue to increase their reliance on self-care. To assist them, pharmacists must remain up-to-date on trends and have an understanding of the nuances of consumers' behavior and thinking in relation to OTC products and their use.",Newton GD; Pray WS; Popovich NG,Journal of the American Pharmacists Association : JAPhA,2004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15098853/,1,0,0,0,0,0
15094101,Oral amino acid administration in patients with diabetes mellitus: supplementation or metabolic therapy?,"Amino acids are essential for body protein synthesis. Moreover, they can be used to produce energy within the cells. For protein turnover, normal plasma amino acid concentration enhances proteolytic suppression by insulin; furthermore, hyperaminoacidemia can stimulate protein synthesis both in the presence of baseline insulin and in hyperinsulinemic subjects with type 1 diabetes. In humans, the availability of amino acids represents a factor more important than insulin in maintaining protein synthesis in skeletal muscle. Among amino acids, branched-chain amino acids exert an anabolic effect on heart protein metabolism, and their uptake by the myocardium is increased by increasing their circulating concentrations. An important aspect of branched-chain amino acid metabolism in the heart (mainly in the ischemic heart) is that branch-chain amino acid infusion can diminish myocardial lactate; in this way, the inhibition of anaerobic energy phosphate caused by accumulation of lactate can be overridden. Plasma amino acid availability plays an important role in promoting protein synthesis and in energy production, both in peripheral skeletal muscle and in the myocardium.",Aquilani R,The American journal of cardiology,2004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15094101/,1,0,0,0,0,0
15094100,Early myocardial dysfunction in the diabetic heart: current research and clinical applications.,"Patients with diabetes mellitus have a high incidence of heart failure, which contributes significantly to their increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. One of the major complications of diabetes is the development of cardiomyopathy, a condition characterized by defects of contractile function in the absence of significant coronary artery disease or systemic hypertension. Experimental data in animal models show that contractile depression begins as early as 1 week after induction of diabetes, and the dysfunction is related to an isomyosin distribution shift from V(1) with high adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) to V(3) with low ATPase activity. Moreover, diabetes is associated with an increased or poorly regulated rate of amino acid catabolism at the cardiac level. Abnormal responses to acute left ventricular (LV) overload induced by exercise (isometric or isotonic) have been demonstrated in patients with diabetes. Impaired augmentation of LV ejection fraction occurs in up to 40% of patients with diabetes. Analysis of the LV afterload-pump function (LV circumferential wall stress-ejection fraction) relationship shows that defective contractile recruitment is the main cause of this anomaly. Exercise-induced LV dysfunction may be the first manifestation of cardiac involvement in patients with diabetes. Increasing the supply of amino acids in addition to conventional therapy significantly attenuates this phenomenon. Although the precise underlying pathophysiologic mechanism is not completely known, these observations may eventually be important in designing an optimal dietary or supplemental approach for patients with diabetes in order to prevent progressive myocardial dysfunction.",Scognamiglio R; Avogaro A; Negut C; Piccolotto R; Vigili de Kreutzenberg S; Tiengo A,The American journal of cardiology,2004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15094100/,1,0,0,0,0,0

15070438,Recent advances in the nutritional biochemistry of trivalent chromium.,"The nutritional biochemistry of trivalent Cr has been a poorly understood field of study; investigations of the biochemistry of the other essential transition metals have not proven as problematic. Despite over four decades of endeavour, only recently has a picture of the role of Cr potentially started to be defined. The biologically-relevant form is the trivalent ion. Cr3+ appears to be required for proper carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in mammals, although fortunately Cr deficiency is difficult to achieve. Conditions that increase circulating glucose and insulin concentrations increase urinary Cr output. Cr is probably excreted in the form of the oligopeptide chromodulin. Chromodulin may be the key to understanding the role of Cr at a molecular level, as the molecule has been found to bind to activated insulin receptor, stimulating its kinase activity. A mechanism for the action of chromodulin has recently been proposed; this mechanism can serve as a potential framework for further studies to test the role of Cr in metabolism. An examination of the nutritional supplement chromium picolinate illustrates some of the difficulties associated with these biochemical studies.",Vincent JB,The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,2004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15070438/,1,0,0,0,0,0

14989367,Oxidative stress and antioxidant supplementation in the management of diabetic cardiovascular disease.,"The diabetic state confers an increased propensity to accelerated atherogenesis. In addition to the established risk factors, there is evidence for increased oxidative stress in diabetes. Increased oxidative stress is manifested by increased lipid peroxidation, increased F2-isoprostanes, increased nitrotyrosine, and increased DNA damage. Also, in diabetics, there is increased superoxide release. With regard to diabetes, antioxidants such as alpha-tocopherol, alpha-lipoate, and ascorbic acid supplementation have been shown to be beneficial. Most importantly, alpha-tocopherol therapy, especially at high doses, clearly shows a benefit with regard to low-density lipoprotein oxidation, isoprostanes, and monocyte superoxide release. Thus, it appears that, in diabetes, antioxidant therapy could alleviate the increased attendant oxidative stress and emerge as an additional therapeutic modality.",Vega-López S; Devaraj S; Jialal I,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,2004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14989367/,1,0,0,0,0,0
14989366,Role of oxidative stress in the etiology of type 2 diabetes and the effect of antioxidant supplementation on glycemic control.,"Oxidative stress is a situation in which the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) exceeds the levels of neutralizing substances referred to as antioxidants. Numerous studies have shown that oxidative stress is associated with type 2 diabetes, and there is compelling biochemical evidence that suggests that ROS may even play a role, if only secondary, in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. These observations have provided sufficient impetus for the use of antioxidant supplements as adjunct therapy for control of blood sugar in diabetic patients. However, there is currently no optimum regimen of antioxidant supplementation for diabetic patients. Studies are required to determine appropriate doses of relevant individual micronutrients that perhaps should be used in combination to diminish oxidative stress and improve glycemic control in individuals afflicted with type 2 diabetes.",Opara EC,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,2004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14989366/,1,0,0,0,0,0
14983576,[Chromium and insulin resistance].,"Since as early as the 50s of the last century, it has been known that chromium is essential for normal glucose metabolism. Too little chromium in the diet may lead to insulin resistance. However, there is still no standard against which chromium deficiency can be established. Nevertheless, chromium supplements are becoming increasingly popular. Various systematic reviews have been unable to demonstrate any effects of chromium on glycaemic regulation (possibly due partly to the low dosages used), but there is a slight reduction in body weight averaging 1 kg. In a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial in a Chinese population with type-2 diabetes mellitus, supplementation with 1000 micrograms of chromium led to a fall in the glycosylated haemoglobin level (HbA1c) by 2%. Toxic effects of chromium are seldom seen; recently, however, the safety of one of the dosage forms of chromium, chromium picolinate, has been questioned. One should be aware that individual patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus may have an increased risk of hypoglycaemic episodes when taking chromium supplements as self-medication.",Kleefstra N; Bilo HJ; Bakker SJ; Houweling ST,Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,2004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14983576/,1,0,0,0,0,0
14757964,"Selenium and thyroid function in infants, children and adolescents.","Selenium is an integral component of the enzymes glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and iodothyronine deiodinases. Although selenium nutrition could conceivably affect thyroid function in infants, children and adolescents, available data suggest that the effect of selenium deficiency on thyroid function is relatively modest. In patients with isolated selenium deficiency (such as patients with phenylketonuria receiving a low-protein diet), peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism is impaired but there are no changes in thyrotropin (TSH) or clinical signs of hypothyroidism, suggesting that these patients are euthyroid. Selenium supplementation may be advisable to optimize tissue GPx activity and prevent potential oxidative stress damage. In areas where combined selenium and iodine deficiencies are present (such as endemic goiter areas in Central Africa), selenium deficiency may be responsible for the destruction of the thyroid gland in myxoedematous cretins but may also play a protective role by mitigating fetal hypothyroidism. In these areas, selenium supplementation should only be advocated at the same time or after iodine supplementation. In patients with absent or decreased production of thyroid hormones and who rely solely on deiodination of exogenous L-thyroxine for generation of the active triiodothyronine (such as patients with congenital hypothyroidism), selenium supplementation may optimize thyroid hormone feedback at the pituitary level and decrease stimulation of the residual thyroid tissue.",Chanoine JP,"BioFactors (Oxford, England)",2003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14757964/,1,0,0,0,0,0
14670550,The potential benefits of dietary and/or supplemental calcium and vitamin D.,"Osteoporosis is a significant problem in women and men. In addition, as osteoporosis has garnered more attention there should be more attention than ever placed on the potential benefits of calcium and vitamin D. Clinicians need to inform patients that there are numerous healthy dietary sources of calcium and vitamin D. Calcium and vitamin D supplements seem to act synergistically to reduce fracture risk in men and women; therefore, they need to be taken together to impact fracture risk. In addition, almost every randomized trial of an effective osteoporosis drug therapy has utilized calcium and vitamin D to enhance the efficacy of the drug itself. Several forms of calcium supplements are commercially available today and clinicians need to understand the similarities and differences between them. Calcium and vitamin D in moderation also have a good safety profile and may actually have benefits far beyond osteoporosis therapy. For example, calcium may increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL), prevent colon polyps, reduce blood pressure, reduce kidney stone recurrence, and may promote weight loss. Vitamin D may reduce the risk of some cancers, provide an enhanced response to some chemotherapeutic agents, prevent type I diabetes, and may reduce tooth loss along with calcium. Clinicians need to encourage individuals to receive the recommended daily allowance of these two agents because they seem to have an impact on numerous health conditions besides osteoporosis.",Moyad MA,Urologic oncology,2003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14670550/,1,0,0,0,0,0

14621110,Nutritional and metabolic modulation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease management.,"In this paper the perspective for nutritional modulation of systemic impairment in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is discussed. Progressive weight loss is characterised by disease-specific elevated energy requirements unbalanced by dietary intake. Weight gain per se can be achieved by caloric supplementation while future studies may prove efficacy of amino acid modulation to stimulate protein synthesis and enhance muscle anabolism. Disproportionate muscle wasting resembles the cachexia syndrome as described in other chronic wasting diseases (cancer, chronic heart failure, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)). There is yet no adequate nutritional strategy available to treat cachexia in COPD. Muscle substrate metabolism has hardly been investigated, but the few data available point towards a decreased fat oxidative capacity that may show similarities with the ""metabolic syndrome"" as described in type II diabetes and obesity and could theoretically benefit from polyunsaturated fatty acid modulation. To adequately target the different therapeutic options, clearly more clinical (intervention) studies are needed in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients that are adequately characterised by local and systemic impairment and in which molecular and metabolic markers are linked to functional outcome.",Schols AM,The European respiratory journal.

14567158,Herbal preparations for obesity: are they useful?,"The opportunities for additional research in this area are plentiful. Unfortunately, there has been relatively limited funding for research on herbal supplements compared with the amount of funding that is available for research on pharmaceuticals. Botanical dietary supplements often contain complex mixtures of phytochemicals that have additive or synergistic interactions. For example, the tea catechins include a group of related compounds with effects that are demonstrable beyond those that are seen with epigallocatechin gallate, the most potent catechin. The metabolism of families of related compounds may be different than the metabolism of purified crystallized compounds. In some cases, herbal medicines may simply be less purified forms of single active ingredients, but in other cases they represent unique formulations of multiple, related compounds that may have superior safety and efficacy compared with single ingredients. Obesity is a global epidemic, and traditional herbal medicines may have more acceptance than prescription drugs in many cultures with emerging epidemics of obesity. Several ethnobotanical studies found herbal treatments for diabetes, and similar surveys, termed bioprospecting, for obesity treatments may be productive. Beyond increasing thermogenesis, there are other biological rationales for the actions of several different alternative medical and herbal approaches to weight loss. For example, several supplements and herbs claim to result in nutrient partitioning so that ingested calories will be directed to muscle, rather than fat. These include an herb (Garcinia cambogia), and a lipid which is the product of bacterial metabolism (conjugated linoleic acid). Moreover, a series of approaches attempt to physically affect gastric satiety by filling the stomach. Fiber swells after ingestion and has was found to result in increased satiety. A binding resin (Chitosan) has the ability to precipitate fat in the laboratory and is touted for its ability to bind fat in the intestines so that it is not absorbed. In double-blind studies, however, this approach was found to be ineffective. There are two key attractions of alternative treatments to obese patients. First, they are viewed as being natural and are assumed by patients to be safer than prescription drugs. Second, there is no perceived need for professional assistance with these approaches. For obese individuals who cannot afford to see a physician, these approaches often represent a more accessible solution. Finally, for many others, these approaches represent alternatives to failed attempts at weight loss with the use of more conventional approaches. These consumers are often discouraged by previous failures, and are likely to combine approaches or use these supplements at doses higher than are recommended. It is vital that the primary care physician is aware of the herbal preparations that are being used by patients so that any potential interaction with prescription drugs or underlying medical conditions can be anticipated. Unfortunately, there have been several instances where unscrupulous profiteers have plundered the resources of the obese public. Although Americans spend $30 billion per year on weight loss aids, our regulatory and monitoring capability as a society are woefully inadequate. Without adequate resources, the FDA resorted to ""guilt by association"" adverse events reporting, which often results in the loss of potentially helpful therapies without adequate investigation of the real causes of the adverse events that are reported. Scientific investigations of herbal and alternative therapies represent a potentially important source for new discoveries in obesity treatment and prevention. Cooperative interactions in research between the Office of Dietary Supplements, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, and the FDA could lead to major advances in research on the efficacy and safety of the most promising of these alternative approaches.",Heber D,Primary care,2003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14567158/,1,0,0,0,0,0

14506887,Can human micronutrient status be improved by supplementing domestic animals?,"Micronutrient deficiencies are a major problem throughout the world and hundreds of millions of the world's population are affected by micronutrient deficiency disorders. In Europe the prevalence of clinical micronutrient deficiency disorders is less than that in the Third World. However, marginal deficiency of some of the micronutrients might be involved in the aetiology of many of the so-called lifestyle diseases, e.g. cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, osteoporosis. Supplementing domestic animals with micronutrients in excess of their needs could be one strategy to increase the intake and, thereby, status of micronutrients in the human population. This approach should, however, be considered carefully, in relation to both animal and human welfare. Many micronutrients that may accumulate in animal foods are toxic in high doses. It would also be unethical to expose animals to doses that might have deleterious effects on their health, and concentrations in animal products that might have adverse effects when consumed by man should be avoided. Furthermore, food quality should not be impaired by the supplement. On the other hand, to be relevant in relation to human nutrition, the given micronutrient should accumulate in animal tissue in concentrations that make an important contribution to total intake. Finally, the micronutrient should be incorporated in a way and in a form that is bioavailable to man, i.e. is well absorbed and utilized.",Bügel S,The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,2003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14506887/,1,0,0,0,0,0
12947460,"Fortification, supplementation, and nutrient balance.","Efforts to combat nutrient deficiencies have centered on supplemental nutrient administration and addition of selected nutrients to the food chain in the form of food fortification. Over the past several decades, and as the association between diet and chronic diseases became apparent, supplementation and fortification were also targeted at healthy individuals, with the aim of reducing their risk of future diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer. While supplementation strategies are playing a major role in reducing micronutrient deficiencies around the world, there is less compelling evidence for their role in reducing risk of chronic diseases in healthy individuals, perhaps with the exception of folic acid and reduction of neural tube defects. Nevertheless, with our increasing understanding of the genetic heterogeneity of human nutrient requirements, it is likely that certain groups or populations may clearly benefit from higher intakes of certain nutrients. In addition to supplementation or fortification with specific nutrients, the consumption of certain dietary patterns (such as the Mediterranean diet) is associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases.",Caballero B,European journal of clinical nutrition,2003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12947460/,1,0,0,0,0,0
12790884,Clinical care of pregnant women with epilepsy: neural tube defects and folic acid supplementation.,"Women with epilepsy (WWE) have a risk of bearing children with congenital malformations that is approximately twice that of the general population. Most antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have been associated with such risk. Valproate and carbamazepine have been associated specifically with the development of neural tube defects (NTDs), especially spina bifida. Other factors may contribute to the risk, including concomitant diseases such as diabetes mellitus, occupational exposure to teratogens, excessive prepregnancy weight, and various nutrient deficiencies. In the general population, maternal folate deficiency, in particular, has been linked with the development of NTDs, and periconceptional folate supplementation with a reduction of risk. It is unclear whether folate supplementation has a comparable protective effect for WWE. Data concerning the risk for congenital malformations associated with the newer AEDs (gabapentin, felbamate, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, tiagabine, topiramate, and zonisamide) are still limited. Several pregnancy registries for women taking AEDs have been established. Comprehensive postmarketing surveillance, regionally or nationally, might be the ideal method of monitoring medication safety, but government support for such an undertaking has for the most part been lacking. Despite uncertainty about the efficacy of periconceptional folate supplementation in WWE, these women should receive such supplementation at dosage levels recommended for the general population of women of childbearing age. Seizure control must not be neglected in a pregnant woman with epilepsy since seizures are associated with harm to the fetus as well as the mother. Risk may be minimized by using a single AED at the lowest effective dosage.",Yerby MS,Epilepsia,2003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12790884/,1,0,0,0,0,0
12786675,Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) has been recognized as a complication of cystic fibrosis (CF) for almost 50 years and commonly develops around 20 years of age. The prevalence increases with age and, with improved survival of those with CF, approaches 30% in certain centres. Its development appears to have a significant impact on pulmonary function and may increase mortality by up to six-fold. Subjects with CF are rarely ketosis-prone and phenotypically lie between Type 1 and Type 2 DM. Microvascular complications are recognized, although paucity of data does not permit a clear description of their natural history. An annual oral glucose tolerance test from the age of 10 years is recommended for screening, but logistical difficulties have led some groups to develop specific algorithms to aid diagnosis. Insulin sensitivity in CF is much debated and may depend upon the degree of glucose intolerance. Insulin resistance occurs in the presence of infection, corticosteroid usage and hyperglycaemia, whilst hepatic insulin resistance is considered an adaptation to CF. There is no universal consensus on the treatment of hyperglycaemia. With increased longevity of individuals with CF, greater numbers will develop diabetes and the diabetes physician is destined to play a greater role in the multidisciplinary CF team.",Mackie AD; Thornton SJ; Edenborough FP,Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12786675/,1,0,0,0,0,0
12737713,Vitamin D and bone health in postmenopausal women.,"Osteoporosis, a disease of increased skeletal fragility, is becoming increasingly common as the U.S. population ages. Adequate vitamin D and calcium intake is the cornerstone of osteoporosis prevention and treatment. Age-related changes in vitamin D and calcium metabolism increase the risk of vitamin D insufficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Although longitudinal data have suggested a role of vitamin D intake in modulating bone loss in perimenopausal women, studies of vitamin D and calcium supplementation have failed to support a significant effect of vitamin D and calcium during early menopause. There is a clearer benefit in vitamin D and calcium supplementation in older postmenopausal women. Vitamin D intake between 500 and 800 IU daily, with or without calcium supplementation, has been shown to increase bone mineral density (BMD) in women with a mean age of approximately 63 years. In women older than 65, there is even more benefit with vitamin D intakes of between 800 and 900 IU daily and 1200-1300 mg of calcium daily, with increased bone density, decreased bone turnover, and decreased nonvertebral fractures. The decreases in nonvertebral fractures may also be influenced by vitamin D-mediated decreases in body sway and fall risk. There are insufficient available data supporting a benefit from vitamin D supplementation alone, without calcium, to prevent osteoporotic fracture in postmenopausal women.",Malabanan AO; Holick MF,Journal of women's health (2002),2003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12737713/,1,0,0,0,0,1
12730487,Iron and oxidative stress in pregnancy.,"Pregnancy, mostly because of the mitochondria-rich placenta, is a condition that favors oxidative stress. Transitional metals, especially iron, which is particularly abundant in the placenta, are important in the production of free radicals. Protective mechanisms against free radical generation and damage increase throughout pregnancy and protect the fetus, which, however, is subjected to a degree of oxidative stress. Oxidative stress peaks by the second trimester of pregnancy, ending what appears to be a vulnerable period for fetal health and gestational progress. Conditions restricted to pregnancy, such as gestational hypertension, insulin resistance and diabetes, exhibit exaggerated indications of free radical damage. Antioxidants as well as avoidance of iron excess ameliorate maternal and early fetal damage. In rats both iron deficiency and excess result in free radical mitochondrial damage. Estimates of gestational iron requirements and of the proportion of iron absorbed from different iron supplemental doses suggest that with present supplementation schemes the intestinal mucosal cells are constantly exposed to unabsorbed iron excess and oxidative stress. Unpublished work carried out in Mexico City with nonanemic women at midpregnancy indicates that 60 mg/d of iron increases the risk of hemoconcentration, low birth weight and premature birth and produces a progressive decline in plasma copper. These risks are not observed in women supplemented with 120 mg iron once or twice per week. Studies on the influence of iron supplementation schemes on oxidative stress are needed.",Casanueva E; Viteri FE,The Journal of nutrition,2003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12730487/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We conducted an electronic literature search of MEDLINE, OLDMEDLINE, Cochrane Library Database, and HealthSTAR, from database inception to May 2002, in addition to performing hand searches and consulting with experts in the field. Available clinical studies published in the English language that used human participants and examined glycemic control were included. Data were extracted in a standardized manner, and two independent investigators assessed methodological quality of randomized controlled trials using the Jadad scale. A total of 108 trials examining 36 herbs (single or in combination) and 9 vitamin/mineral supplements, involving 4,565 patients with diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. There were 58 controlled clinical trials involving individuals with diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance (42 randomized and 16 nonrandomized trials). Most studies involved patients with type 2 diabetes. Heterogeneity and the small number of studies per supplement precluded formal meta-analyses. Of these 58 trials, the direction of the evidence for improved glucose control was positive in 76% (44 of 58). Very few adverse effects were reported. There is still insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions about the efficacy of individual herbs and supplements for diabetes; however, they appear to be generally safe. The available data suggest that several supplements may warrant further study. The best evidence for efficacy from adequately designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is available for Coccinia indica and American ginseng.

12488710,Issues in hyperlipidemic pancreatitis.,"Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is a rare cause of pancreatitis. Pancreatitis secondary to HTG, presents typically as an episode of acute pancreatitis (AP) or recurrent AP, rarely as chronic pancreatitis. A serum triglyceride (TG) level of more than 1,000 to 2,000 mg/dL in patients with type I, IV, or V hyperlipidemia (Fredrickson's classification) is an identifiable risk factor. The typical clinical profile of hyperlipidemic pancreatitis (HLP) is a patient with a preexisting lipid abnormality along with the presence of a secondary factor (e.g., poorly controlled diabetes, alcohol use, or a medication) that can induce HTG. Less commonly, a patient with isolated hyperlipidemia (type V or I) without a precipitating factor presents with pancreatitis. Interestingly, serum pancreatic enzymes may be normal or only minimally elevated, even in the presence of severe pancreatitis diagnosed by imaging studies. The clinical course in HLP is not different from that of pancreatitis of other causes. Routine management of AP caused by hyperlipidemia should be similar to that of other causes. A thorough family history of lipid abnormalities should be obtained, and an attempt to identify secondary causes should be made. Reduction of TG levels to well below 1,000 mg/dL effectively prevents further episodes of pancreatitis. The mainstay of treatment includes dietary restriction of fat and lipid-lowering medications (mainly fibric acid derivatives). Experiences with plasmapheresis, lipid pheresis, and extracorporeal lipid elimination are limited.",Yadav D; Pitchumoni CS,Journal of clinical gastroenterology,2003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12488710/,1,0,0,0,0,0

12126463,The safety and efficacy of high-dose chromium.,"The data on the standards for chromium requirements and the safety of various chromium compounds and doses are reviewed. The 350-fold difference between the acceptable daily intake and the calculated reference dose for humans of 70 mg per day seems without precedent with respect to other nutritional minerals. Previous claims of mutagenic effects of chromium are of questionable relevance. While studies have found DNA fragmentation (clastogenic effects) by chromium picolinate, anecdotal reports of high-dose chromium picolinate toxicity are few and ambiguous. The beneficial effects of chromium on serum glucose and lipids and insulin resistance occur even in the healthy. Serum glucose can be improved by chromium supplementation in both types 1 and 2 diabetes, and the effect appears dose dependent. Relative absorption of various chromium compounds is summarized and the mechanism of low molecular weight chromium binding substance (LMWCr) in up-regulating the insulin effect eight-fold is discussed. There is evidence of hormonal effects of supplemental chromium besides the effect on insulin. Chromium supplementation does result in tissue retention, especially in the kidney, although no pathogenic effect has been demonstrated despite considerable study.",Lamson DW; Plaza SM,Alternative medicine review : a journal of clinical therapeutic,2002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12126463/,1,0,0,0,0,0
12109306,[Cardiovascular risk factors. I. Review of possible causes of heart and vascular diseases].,"Despite the decline in the past 30 years in age-adjusted mortality, cardiovascular disease is still the most important cause of morbidity and mortality in the Western world and increasingly so in the non-Western world. The decreased mortality rate is attributed to increased knowledge of the risk factors, a concomitant healthier life style and improved treatment for the risk factors. It has been clearly demonstrated that increased serum levels of cholesterol, increased blood pressure, the presence of diabetes, physical inactivity and smoking increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. The role of estrogens, homocysteine, thrombotic and inflammatory factors is currently the subject of considerable research. It seems likely that a certain genetic constitution enhances the susceptibility to the effects of other risk factors. New candidate genes are being suggested daily. Until now, no clearly decisive results have been achieved in determining the relations between the investigated genetic polymorphisms and the occurrence of cardiovascular disease. The consumption of foodstuffs that are rich in anti-oxidants seems to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, but randomised research into the effects of anti-oxidants as food supplements suggests that this does not affect the development of cardiovascular disease.",van der Bom JG; Bots ML; Grobbee DE,Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,2002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12109306/,1,0,0,0,0,0
12081828,Glucose and insulin responses to dietary chromium supplements: a meta-analysis.,"Several authors, mostly on the basis of nonrandomized studies, have suggested dietary trivalent chromium supplementation as an attractive option for the management of type 2 diabetes and for glycemic control in persons at high risk of type 2 diabetes. The study aimed to determine the effect of chromium on glucose and insulin responses in healthy subjects and in individuals with glucose intolerance or type 2 diabetes. The study design was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The authors identified 20 reports of RCTs assessing the effect of chromium on glucose, insulin, or glycated hemoglobin (Hb A(1c)). This review summarizes data on 618 participants from the 15 trials that reported adequate data: 193 participants had type 2 diabetes and 425 were in good health or had impaired glucose tolerance. The meta-analysis showed no association between chromium and glucose or insulin concentrations among nondiabetic subjects. A study of 155 diabetic subjects in China showed that chromium reduced glucose and insulin concentrations; the combined data from the 38 diabetic subjects in the other studies did not. Three trials reported data on Hb A(1c): one study each of persons with type 2 diabetes, persons with impaired glucose tolerance, and healthy subjects. The study of diabetic subjects in China was the only one to report that chromium significantly reduced Hb A(1c). Data from RCTs show no effect of chromium on glucose or insulin concentrations in nondiabetic subjects. The data for persons with diabetes are inconclusive. RCTs in well-characterized, at-risk populations are necessary to determine the effects of chromium on glucose, insulin, and Hb A(1c).",Althuis MD; Jordan NE; Ludington EA; Wittes JT,The American journal of clinical nutrition,2002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12081828/,0,1,0,1,0,0
12055357,Phytosterols in human nutrition.,"Phytosterols are cholesterol-like molecules found in all plant foods, with the highest concentrations occurring in vegetable oils. They are absorbed only in trace amounts but inhibit the absorption of intestinal cholesterol including recirculating endogenous biliary cholesterol, a key step in cholesterol elimination. Natural dietary intake varies from about 167-437 mg/day. Attempts to measure biological effects in feeding studies have been impeded by limited solubility in both water and fat. Esterification of phytosterols with long-chain fatty acids increases fat solubility by 10-fold and allows delivery of several grams daily in fatty foods such as margarine. A dose of 2 g/day as the ester reduces low density lipoprotein cholesterol by 10%, and little difference is observed between Delta(5)-sterols and 5alpha-reduced sterols (stanols). Phytosterols can also be dispersed in water after emulsification with lecithin and reduce cholesterol absorption when added to nonfat foods. In contrast to these supplementation studies, much less is known about the effect of low phytosterol levels in the natural diet. However, reduction of cholesterol absorption can be measured at a dose of only 150 mg during otherwise sterol-free test meals, suggesting that natural food phytosterols may be clinically important. Current literature suggests that phytosterols are safe when added to the diet, and measured absorption and plasma levels are very small. Increasing the aggregate amount of phytosterols consumed in a variety of foods may be an important way of reducing population cholesterol levels and preventing coronary heart disease.",Ostlund RE,Annual review of nutrition,2002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12055357/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The recommended dietary intake of vitamin D for U.S. infants is 5 microg/day and the tolerable upper level is 25 microg/day.

11989140,"Oxidative stress, micronutrients, diabetes mellitus and its complications.","Oxidative stress is defined as excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of diminished antioxidant substances. It has been shown that oxidative stress has an adverse effect on glucose metabolism. Development of the disabling chronic complications of diabetes mellitus (DM) has also been attributed to oxidative stress. The body's defence against oxidative stress is accomplished by interconnecting systems of antioxidant micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) and enzymes. While the vitamins act as donors and acceptors of ROS, minerals regulate activity of the enzymes. This review article is focused on the preventive and therapeutic roles of these antioxidant micronutrients in DM. Although there is scarcity of data from controlled studies, anecdotal reports indicate that the use of certain antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements may be beneficial as an adjunct therapy in the management of DM and its complications. In particular, it has been reported that high doses of single micronutrient antioxidant supplements, such as vitamin E, may be beneficial to patients suffering from this disease. However, micronutrient antioxidants interact with each other in a biochemical chain of defence against free radicals, and the use of high doses of a single antioxidant poses potential risks because it could perturb the antioxidant-prooxidant balance. It has, therefore, been recommended that high doses of micronutrient antioxidant vitamins should be administered in combination rather than as single supplements. There are a growing number of preparations containing mixtures of antioxidant vitamins and/or trace elements. A particularly impressive supplement is a new formula called Akesis, which is a mixture of antioxidant vitamins and antidiabetic trace elements, adequately balanced with other vitamins and minerals that enhance metabolic processes.",Opara EC,The journal of the Royal Society for the Promotion of Health,2002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11989140/,1,0,0,0,0,0

However, lifestyle management measures may be insufficient or patient compliance difficult, rendering conventional drug therapies (i.e., oral glucose-lowering agents and insulin injection) necessary in many patients. In addition to adverse effects, drug treatments are not always satisfactory in maintaining euglycemia and avoiding late stage diabetic complications.

11730237,Nutrition and health promotion in older adults.,"During recent decades, the concept of health promotion has become a legitimate part of health care because of the aging of the postwar baby boom generation. As this population ages, the potential strain on health care systems will increase because the greatest use of health care services occurs during the last years of life. In older adults there are many correctable health factors that can be assessed through screening protocols. Hypertension, cholesterol, hearing, vision, diabetes, and cancer screening are well integrated into health promotion programs; nutrition promotion programs are not as well integrated. Reluctance to develop health promotion programs for older adults exists because of a perception that they would not follow such plans or change their lifestyles. However, longitudinal studies have shown that health promotion activities extend the number of years of health in older people although the relationship weakens in older age. Changes in diet and exercise patterns are most effective in the prevention of nutrition-related conditions when they are instituted early in life, but positive effects can occur at any age. If nutritional interventions are instituted early, a substantial reduction in health care expenditures may result from a decrease in the incidence or the delayed onset of these conditions. Changes in behaviors (reducing salt and fat intake) were positively associated with a belief that consuming a healthful diet would contribute to better health. The use of a variety of adult education theories and models will enhance behavior changes that lead to more healthful habits and enable a health educator to be successful in effecting change.",Chernoff R,"The journals of gerontology.

11603646,Konjac-Mannan and American ginsing: emerging alternative therapies for type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Despite significant achievements in treatment modalities and preventive measures, the prevalence of diabetes has risen exponentially in the last decade. Because of these limitations there is a continued need for new and more effective therapies. An increasing number of people are using dietary and herbal supplements, even though there is a general lack of evidence for their safety and efficacy. Consequently, science based medical and government regulators are calling for more randomized clinical studies to provide evidence of efficacy and safety. Our research group has selected two such promising and functionally complementary therapies for further investigation as potentially emerging alternative therapies for type 2 diabetes: Konjac-mannan (KJM) and American ginseng (AG). We have generated a mounting body of evidence to support the claim that rheologically-selected, highly-viscous KJM, and AG with a specific composition may be useful in improving diabetes control, reducing associated risk factors such as hyperlipidemia and hypertension, and ameliorating insulin resistance. KJM has a demonstrated ability to modulate the rate of absorption of nutrients from the small bowel, whereas AG has post-absorptive effects. Consequently, it appears that KJM and AG are acting through different, yet complementary, mechanisms: KJM by increasing insulin sensitivity and AG likely by enhancing insulin secretion. Before the therapeutic potential of KJM and AG as novel prandial agents for treatment of diabetes can be fully realized, further controlled trials with larger sample sizes and of longer duration are required. A determination of the active ingredients in AG, and the rheology-biology relationship of KJM are also warranted.",Vuksan V; Sievenpiper JL; Xu Z; Wong EY; Jenkins AL; Beljan-Zdravkovic U; Leiter LA; Josse RG; Stavro MP,Journal of the American College of Nutrition,2001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11603646/,1,0,0,0,0,0

11570983,Nutrition and cognitive impairment in the elderly.,"As the number of older people is growing rapidly worldwide and the fact that elderly people are also apparently living longer, dementia, the most common cause of cognitive impairment is getting to be a greater public health problem. Nutrition plays a role in the ageing process, but there is still a lack of knowledge about nutrition-related risk factors in cognitive impairment. Research in this area has been intensive during the last decade, and results indicate that subclinical deficiency in essential nutrients (antioxidants such as vitamins C, E and beta-carotene, vitamin B(12), vitamin B(6), folate) and nutrition-related disorders, as hypercholesterolaemia, hypertriacylglycerolaemia, hypertension, and diabetes could be some of the nutrition-related risk factors, which can be present for a long time before cognitive impairment becomes evident. Large-scale clinical trials in high-risk populations are needed to determine whether lowering blood homocysteine levels reduces the risk of cognitive impairment and may delay the clinical onset of dementia and perhaps of Alzheimer's disease. A curative treatment of cognitive impairment, especially Alzheimer's disease, is currently impossible. Actual drug therapy, if started early enough, may slow down the progression of the disease. Longitudinal studies are required in order to establish the possible link of nutrient intake--nutritional status with cognitive impairment, and if it is possible, in fact, to inhibit or delay the onset of dementia.",González-Gross M; Marcos A; Pietrzik K,The British journal of nutrition,2001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11570983/,1,0,0,0,0,1
11423700,Safety aspects of iron in food.,"During the last decades efforts regarding dietary iron supply focused mostly on the prevention of deficiencies, especially during growth and pregnancy. Correspondingly, homeostatic mechanisms increase intestinal iron absorption in iron deficiency, but its downregulation at high intake levels seems insufficient to prevent accumulation of high iron stores at high intake. There is no regulated iron excretion in overload. Excess of pharmaceutical iron may cause toxicity and therapeutic doses may cause gastrointestinal side effects. Chronic iron excess, e.g. in primary and secondary hemochromatosis, may lead to hepatic fibrosis, diabetes mellitus and cardiac failure. Chronic intake of 50-100 mg Fe/day of highly bioavailable iron with home-brewed beer in sub-Saharan Africans lead to cirrhosis and diabetes. Applying a safety factor of 2 would lead to an upper safe level of 25-50 mg Fe/day for this endpoint of conventional iron toxicity. However, beyond this kind of damage iron is known to catalyze the generation of hydroxyl radicals from superoxide anions and to increase oxidative stress which, in turn, increases free iron concentration. This self-amplifying process may cause damage to lipid membranes and proteins, which relates radical generation and organ damage after ischemia-reperfusion events to available free iron in clinical and experimental settings. Correspondingly, epidemiological studies as well as observations in heterozygotes for hereditary hemochromatosis suggest that the risk of atherosclerosis and acute myocardial infarction is related to body iron stores, though there is conflicting epidemiological evidence as well. The most recent and best controlled studies, however, support the hypothesis that iron stores are related to cardiovascular risk. Iron-amplified oxidative stress may also increase DNA damage, oxidative activation of precancerogens and support tumor cell growth. This is supported by experimental, clinical and epidemiological observations. Due to these mechanisms high iron stores may present a health hazard. Though this has not been finally proven, available evidence strongly recommends not to increase iron intake beyond physiological requirements. To avoid iron deficiency symptoms, on the other hand, care must be taken to meet recommended daily intake.",Schümann K,Annals of nutrition & metabolism,2001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11423700/,1,0,0,0,0,0

11192356,"Coronary artery disease--free radical damage, antioxidant protection and the role of homocysteine.","Traditional risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) can only explain approximately two thirds of the observed clinical events. This has maintained interest in other nutritional and biochemical factors that might contribute to the underlying pathophysiology of vascular disease. Two such factors are dietary antioxidants and plasma homocysteine. Established risk factors such as hypertension, smoking and diabetes mellitus are all associated with increased oxidative stresses due to excess free radical activity in the vascular wall. This may facilitate the development of vascular disease because of (i) increased oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles which increases their propensity to deposition in the vascular wall, (ii) inactivation of endothelium-derived nitric oxide, and (iii) direct cytotoxicity to endothelial cells. Protective antioxidant molecules include vitamin C and vitamin E of which the latter is lipid soluble and is the primary antioxidant defence in circulating LDL particles. Epidemiological studies have suggested strongly that individuals who have high circulating concentrations or dietary intake of natural antioxidant vitamins are protected against vascular disease events (18). Furthermore, many studies have demonstrated a beneficial effect of natural and synthetic antioxidants on surrogate markers of vascular disease such as endothelial function and lipoprotein oxidation. However, large prospective randomized controlled intervention trials, mostly involving vitamin E (e.g. CHAOS, HOPE (22)), have failed to demonstrate any beneficial effect upon vascular mortality in high risk individuals. Possible reasons for these disappointing results include the pro-oxidant effects of high dose antioxidant supplements, particularly in patients with established vascular disease. Homocysteine is a sulphydryl-containing amino acid derived from the demethylation of dietary methionine. Epidemiological studies over 30 years have shown that increased concentrations of homocysteine are associated with vascular disease. This link is independent of other risk factors, is consistent across many studies and is strongly dose-related. Recently, evidence has accumulated to suggest that this link is also biologically plausible because homocysteine promotes oxidant injury to the vascular endothelium, impairs endothelium-dependent vasomotor regulation and may also alter the coagulant properties of the blood. Plasma homocysteine levels can be reduced by dietary supplements of folic acid and B vitamins. Studies are currently being undertaken to examine the impact of these vitamins in high risk patients and, thereby, establish a causative role for homocysteine in promoting vascular events.",Maxwell SR,Basic research in cardiology,2000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11192356/,1,0,0,0,0,0
10984551,Identifying patients at risk for coronary heart disease: implications from trials of lipid-lowering drug therapy.,"Abnormal lipid levels contribute significantly to the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), which is increased further in the presence of other risk factors. The association between elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and CHD risk is well established, and large primary and secondary prevention studies of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have shown conclusively that lowering LDL cholesterol levels reduces CHD events and total mortality. Regardless of the intervention used (diet, surgery, drugs), reduction of plasma cholesterol has consistently produced a reduction in cardiovascular risk. Absolute benefit is greatest in those who are at highest risk initially, and trial results suggest that the lower the LDL cholesterol level achieved, at least down to LDL of 3.0 mmol/l, then the lower is the CHD event risk. Epidemiological data also point to the negative impact of other lipids on CHD risk. Low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and high levels of triglycerides (particularly in conjunction with an LDL/HDL ratio >5) are particularly strong risk factors for CHD. Thus, although prevention trials to date have primarily assessed the impact of LDL lowering on CHD events, the initial assessment of CHD risk should consider a more detailed atherogenic profile including HDL and triglyceride levels. A general approach to preventing cardiovascular disease should include strategies to reduce the overall CHD risk by lifestyle modification and management of modifiable risk factors such as smoking, hypertension and diabetes. Based on data from recent prevention studies, and because they are the most potent lipid-lowering agents available for lowering LDL cholesterol, statins have appropriately become the drug of choice for most patients with hyperlipidaemia who require drug therapy.",Isles CG; Paterson JR,QJM : monthly journal of the Association of Physicians,2000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10984551/,1,0,0,0,0,0

A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, Lilacs, the Cochrane Clinical Trials Registry bibliographies of relevant papers, and expert input updated through September 1998 was undertaken. All randomized placebo-controlled trials were included in which fish oil supplementation was the only intervention in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Three investigators performed data extraction and quality scoring independently with discrepancies resolved by consensus. Eighteen trials including 823 subjects followed for a mean of 12 weeks were included. Doses of fish oil used ranged from 3 to 18 g/day The outcomes studied were glycemic control and lipid levels. Meta-analysis of pooled data demonstrated a statistically significant effect of fish oil on lowering triglycerides (-0.56 mmol/l [95% CI -0.71 to -0.41]) and raising LDL cholesterol (0.21 mmol/l [0.02 to 0.41]). No statistically significant effect was observed for fasting glucose. HbA1c total cholesterol, or HDL cholesterol. The triglyceride-lowering effect and the elevation in LDL cholesterol were most marked in those trials that recruited hypertriglyceridemic subjects and used higher doses of fish oil. Heterogeneity was observed and explained by the recruitment of subjects with baseline hypertriglyceridemia in some studies. Fish oil supplementation in type 2 diabetes lowers triglycerides, raises LDL cholesterol, and has no statistically significant effect on glycemic control.

10963721,Oxidative stress and cardiovascular complications in diabetes: isoprostanes as new markers on an old paradigm.,"Long-term vascular complications still represent the main cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Although randomized long-term clinical studies comparing the effects of conventional and intensive therapy have demonstrated a clear link between hyperglycemia and the development of complications of diabetes, they have not defined the mechanism through which excess glucose results in tissue damage. Evidence has accumulated indicating that oxidative stress may play a key role in the etiology of diabetic complications. Isoprostanes are emerging as a new class of biologically active products of arachidonic acid metabolism of potential relevance to human vascular disease. Their formation in vivo seems to reflect primarily, if not exclusively, a nonenzymatic process of lipid peroxidation. Enhanced urinary excretion of 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) has been described in association with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and correlates with impaired glycemic control. Besides providing a likely noninvasive index of lipid peroxidation in this setting, measurements of specific F(2) isoprostanes in urine may provide a sensitive biochemical end point for dose-finding studies of natural and synthetic inhibitors of lipid peroxidation. Although the biological effects of 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) in vitro suggest that it and other isoeicosanoids may modulate the functional consequences of lipid peroxidation in diabetes, evidence that this is likely in vivo remains inadequate at this time.",Mezzetti A; Cipollone F; Cuccurullo F,Cardiovascular research,2000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10963721/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Chromium3+ may be involved in chromium6+-induced cancers because chromium6+ is converted to chromium3+ in vivo, and chromium3+ is genotoxic and mutagenic. Although there is no direct evidence of chromium deficiencies in humans, dietary supplements exist to provide supraphysiological doses of absorbable chromium3+. Chromium3+ may act clinically by interfering with iron absorption, decreasing the high iron stores that are linked to diabetes and heart disease.

A large number of human studies have been performed in order to improve knowledge on the influence of this element in the origin and development of several degenerative diseases. Selenium deficiencies among human beings as well as animals are being recognized worldwide to be related to a number of pathologies. This element has also the special characteristic that the range between its essential and toxic character is very close, and consequently daily dietary intake should be appropriately monitored in individuals. Nevertheless, nowadays there is still a lot of controversy about the optimum dietary level of this element in order to cure or to prevent the appearance of diseases such as cirrhosis, cancer, diabetes, or cardiovascular pathologies. Results obtained in several animal and epidemiological studies have indicated that Se could constitute a dietary factor with protective action against several degenerative diseases.",Navarro-Alarcón M; López-Martínez MC,The Science of the total environment,2000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10813463/,1,0,0,0,0,0
10812920,Quest for the molecular mechanism of chromium action and its relationship to diabetes.,"Despite forty years of research on the potential role of chromium in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, significant progress has only recently been made regarding the mode of action of chromium at a molecular level. The oligopeptide low-molecular-weight chromium-binding substance (LMWCr) may function as part of a novel insulin-signaling autoamplification mechanism. The proposed mechanism of action also sheds some light on the potential of chromium-containing compounds as nutritional supplements or in the treatment of adult-onset diabetes and other conditions. The potential relationship between the results of recent studies on diabetic patients and the proposed mode of action of LMWCr are discussed.",Vincent JB,Nutrition reviews,2000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10812920/,1,0,0,0,0,0
10727669,"Magnesium. An update on physiological, clinical and analytical aspects.","There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium ions in clinical medicine, nutrition and physiology. The characteristics of the binding of magnesium and calcium ions to various components, macromolecules and biological membranes are described. Magnesium affects many cellular functions, including transport of potassium and calcium ions, and modulates signal transduction, energy metabolism and cell proliferation. The mechanism of cellular uptake and efflux of magnesium, its intracellular transport, intestinal absorption, renal excretion and the effect of hormones on these are reviewed. Magnesium deficiency is not uncommon among the general population: its intake has decreased over the years especially in the western world. The magnesium supplementation or intravenous infusion may be beneficial in various diseased states. Of special interest is the magnesium status in alcoholism, eclampsia, hypertension, atherosclerosis, cardiac diseases, diabetes, and asthma. The development of instrumentation for the assay of ionized magnesium is reviewed, as are the analytical procedures for total magnesium in blood and free magnesium in the cytosol. The improved procedures for the assay of different magnesium states are useful in understanding the role of magnesium in health and disease.",Saris NE; Mervaala E; Karppanen H; Khawaja JA; Lewenstam A,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,2000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10727669/,1,0,0,0,0,0
