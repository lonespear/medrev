41624190,Diet type and the oral microbiome.,"The oral microbiome changes across the lifespan and is modulated by behavioral and metabolic exposures. Tobacco consumption, suboptimal hygiene, and frequent sugar intake disrupt microbial homeostasis, thereby increasing vulnerability to chronic oral diseases. While diet influences systemic metabolic and inflammatory health, evidence describing persistent, direct ecological effects on oral microbial communities remains limited. The objective of this study is to synthesize mechanistic insights on how dietary patterns shape the oral microbiome and influence systemic inflammatory or metabolic risk. A narrative, non-systematic review was conducted through expansive literature exploration. Peer-reviewed original and clinical studies reporting defined dietary exposures caloric restriction, plant-based diets, inorganic nitrate and fiber intake, and high-fat or high-sugar processed diets, were qualitatively evaluated for mechanistic relevance. Plant-enriched, high-fiber diets, nitrate intake, and caloric restriction were associated with reduced oxidative stress, lower pro-inflammatory cytokines, and greater diversity of commensal taxa, suggesting improved ecological stability. In contrast, processed diets promote metabolic conditions that indirectly remodel the oral habitat, favoring dysbiosis and a niche permissive to periodontitis. The diet-oral microbiome-systemic inflammation axis is bidirectional and clinically relevant. Understanding both direct ecological regulation and indirect metabolic effects is essential to support precision nutrition strategies aimed at maintaining oral microbial balance and systemic inflammatory risk mitigation.",Betancur D; Jara EL; Lima CA; Victoriano M,Frontiers in nutrition,2026,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41624190/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41622927,"Polyphenols, epigenetics, and methionine metabolism: unlocking therapeutic potential.","Polyphenols, abundant in tea, fruits, vegetables, and other plant-derived foods, have emerged as key bioactive ingredients in the field of nutritional epigenetics. These polyphenols can modulate epigenetic modifications through endogenous metabolic pathways that are highly sensitive to food signals. Among these, the methionine cycle plays a central role in maintaining the homeostasis of DNA, histone, and RNA methylation by controlling the cellular supply of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the universal methyl donor. Dietary polyphenols influence this cycle through multiple mechanisms, including the regulation of methionine adenosyltransferase activity, modulation of SAM biosynthesis, and promotion of S-adenosylhomocysteine clearance. These actions help restore methylation balance and contribute to the dietary prevention of metabolic, inflammatory, and age-related diseases. Furthermore, polyphenols are biotransformed in the gut microbiota to produce metabolites that further influence methionine metabolism and its associated epigenetic modifications. This review provides an overview of dietary polyphenols as functional food supplements that play a role in methionine metabolic homeostasis and epigenetic modification. This review provides new perspectives for the development of precision nutrition strategies, functional foods, and chronic disease prevention approaches.",Liang J; Zhao Y; Cheng Y; Hu Z; Yuan Y; Xiao J; Farag MA; Cai X; Cao H; Yue T,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41622927/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41517088,Artificial Intelligence-Driven Food Safety: Decoding Gut Microbiota-Mediated Health Effects of Non-Microbial Contaminants.,"A wide range of non-microbial contaminants-such as heavy metals, pesticide residues, antibiotics, as well emerging foodborne contaminants like micro- and nanoplastics and persistent organic pollutants-can enter the human body through daily diet and exert subtle yet chronic effects that are increasingly recognized to be gut microbiota-dependent. However, the relationships among multi-contaminant exposure profiles, dynamic microbial community structures, microbial metabolites, and diverse clinical or subclinical phenotypes are highly non-linear and multidimensional, posing major challenges to traditional analytical approaches. Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a powerful tool to untangle the complex interactions between foodborne non-microbial contaminants, the gut microbiota, and host health. This review synthesizes current knowledge on how key classes of non-microbial food contaminants modulate gut microbial composition and function, and how these alterations, in turn, influence intestinal barrier integrity, immune homeostasis, metabolic regulation, and systemic disease risk. We then highlight recent advances in the application of AI techniques, including machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and network-based methods, to integrate multi-omics and exposure data, identify microbiota and metabolite signatures of specific contaminants, and infer potential causal pathways within ""contaminant-microbiota-host"" axes. Finally, we discuss current limitations, such as data heterogeneity, small-sample bias, and interpretability gaps, and propose future directions for building standardized datasets, explainable AI frameworks, and human-relevant experimental validation pipelines. Overall, AI-enabled analysis offers a promising avenue to refine food safety risk assessment, support precision nutrition strategies, and develop microbiota-targeted interventions against non-microbial food contaminants.",Xue R; Zong X; Jiang X; You G; Wei Y; Guo B,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41517088/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41515177,Thyroid-Microbiome Allostasis and Mitochondrial Performance: An Integrative Perspective in Exercise Physiology.,"Exercise acts as a physiological stimulus, requiring precise coordination among endocrine, microbial, and mitochondrial systems to maintain metabolic stability through allostatic regulation. The goal of the article is to integrate multidisciplinary evidence to characterize the thyroid-microbiome-mitochondrial axis as a key regulator of the allostatic state in athletic physiological response. During acute, chronic, and overload training phases, the thyroid-microbiome-mitochondrial axis operates bidirectionally, coupling microbial signaling with endocrine and mitochondrial networks to mediate metabolic response to exercise. This response shows interindividual variability driven by sex, age, genetics, and nutritional status, shaping the boundaries between adaptive efficiency and allostatic overload. Microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and secondary bile acids, modulate deiodinase activity, bile acid recycling, and mitochondrial biogenesis through AMPK-SIRT1-PGC1α signaling, optimizing substrate use and thermogenic capacity. Thyroid hormones reciprocally regulate gut motility, luminal pH, and bile secretion, maintaining microbial diversity and mineral absorption. Under excessive training load, caloric restriction, or inadequate recovery, this network becomes transiently unbalanced: SCFA synthesis decreases, D3 activity increases, and a reversible low-T<sub>3</sub>/high-rT<sub>3</sub> pattern emerges, resembling early Hashimoto- or Graves-like responses. Selenium-, zinc-, and iron-dependent enzymes form the redox link between microbial metabolism, thyroid control, and mitochondrial defense. In conclusion, the thyroid-microbiome-mitochondrial axis provides the physiological basis for the allostatic state, a reversible phase of dynamic recalibration that integrates training, nutrition, environmental stress, and circadian cues to sustain thyroid activity, mitochondrial efficiency, and microbial balance. This integrative perspective supports precision interventions to optimize recovery and performance in athletes.",Odriozola A; González A; Odriozola I; Corbi F; Álvarez-Herms J,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41515177/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41511307,Microbiota-Mediated Bile Acid Metabolism as a Mechanistic Framework for Precision Nutrition in Gastrointestinal and Metabolic Diseases.,"Gut microbiota play a central role in shaping bile acid (BA) metabolism through community-specific capacities for deconjugation, dehydroxylation, and other transformation reactions. Distinct microbiome compositional patterns-often referred to as enterotype-like clusters-correspond to reproducible functional profiles that generate unique BA metabolic signatures with relevance for metabolic and gastrointestinal health. This narrative review synthesizes current evidence describing the interplay between microbial composition, BA metabolism, and metabolic dysfunction. A structured literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Scopus using predefined keywords related to bile acids, microbiome composition, metabolic disorders, and enterotypes. Studies were screened for human clinical relevance and mechanistic insights into BA-microbiome interactions. Across the evidence base, <i>Bacteroides-</i>, <i>Prevotella</i>-, and <i>Ruminococcus</i>-associated community types consistently demonstrate different BA transformation capacities that influence secondary BA production and downstream host signaling through <i>FXR</i> and <i>TGR5</i>. These differences are linked to variation in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and colorectal cancer. Host genetic variations in BA synthesis, transport, and signaling further modify these microbiome-BA interactions, contributing to the heterogeneity of dietary intervention responses. Overall, the literature supports a model in which microbiome-derived BA profiles act as metabolic phenotypes that shape host lipid and glucose homeostasis, inflammation, and gut-liver axis integrity. Emerging clinical applications include microbiome-stratified dietary strategies, targeted probiotics with defined BA-modifying functions, and therapeutic approaches that align BA-modulating interventions with an individual's microbial metabolic capacity. Establishing integrated biomarker platforms combining microbiome clustering with BA profiling will be essential for advancing precision nutrition and personalized management of metabolic and gastrointestinal diseases.",Kang S; Jeong DY; Seo J; Daily JW; Park S,Cells,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41511307/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41502883,Exploring the role of the gut microbiome in pediatric gastrointestinal and neurological health.,"The gut microbiome, a complex ecosystem of microorganisms that inhabit the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, is now understood to be a central regulator of pediatric health and development. This review discusses its centrality in GI and neurological outcomes, with a particular focus on the devastating effects of malnutrition. It also discusses how microbial homeostasis (dysbiosis), especially that induced by protein-energy and micronutrient deficiencies, interferes with nutrient absorption, enhances intestinal inflammation, and alters gut-brain communication. Dysbiosis is mechanistically connected to the pathogenesis and severity of other pediatric disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The most important pathways of gut dysbiosis-related disease mechanisms. include the altered production of microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), impaired gut barrier integrity (""leaky gut""), and disrupted immune and neuroendocrine signaling. To address these issues, this article outlines potential therapeutic solutions that seek to restore microbial balance. Targeted probiotic and prebiotic supplementation, dietary interventions, and the emerging field of precision nutrition, which enables interventions to be tailored based on a child's individual microbiome and genetic makeup, are also mentioned as possible ways to improve the GI and neurological health of malnourished children. Learning how these interactions between the gut microbiome, nutrition, and the gut-brain axis (GBA). Work could revolutionize the development of new treatments for preventing and treating pediatric diseases caused by microbial imbalances.",Zhang C; Lin G; Lu X; Yu X,Translational pediatrics,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41502883/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41482235,The Mediating Role of the Gut Microbiome in the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer.,"The concept of food as medicine is gaining renewed importance in oncology, with growing recognition that diet is not only supportive care but also a mechanistically informed intervention for cancer treatment. However, the biological basis linking nutrition to cancer outcomes has remained incomplete until recent advances positioned the gut microbiome as the missing link. Recent research has highlighted the gut microbiome as a key mediator, acting as a biochemical and immunological bridge that transforms dietary compounds into metabolites, influencing inflammation, immune function, and carcinogenesis. This perspective shifts nutrition from a supportive measure to an active, evidence-based strategy in cancer prevention. In this review, we highlight how specific foods, nutrients, and microbial consortia contribute to anticancer effects, while also identifying research gaps related to causality, multiomics integration, and the need to account for global dietary and genetic diversity.",Chambial P; Thakur N; Kumar U; Gupta S,The Journal of nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41482235/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41471872,Dietary Modulation of the Gut Microbiota in Dogs and Cats and Its Role in Disease Management.,"Food has a massive influence on the gut microbiota and is one of the most useful therapeutic levers in disease. Recent developments have highlighted how macronutrient balance, food format, and functional ingredients can regulate microbial diversity, metabolism, and host physiology in companion animals such as dogs and cats. This narrative review condenses evidence on the bidirectional gut microbiota-diet connection and on nutritional therapy for gastrointestinal, metabolic, renal, hepatic, and immune-mediated disorders. Protein-based diets including high or hydrolyzed protein, omega-3 acids, fermentative fiber, and probiotics can positively affect microbial composition, stimulate short-chain fatty acid synthesis, and enhance intestinal barrier functions. Conversely, excess fats or refined carbohydrates may cause dysbiosis, inflammation, and metabolic imbalances. Numerous studies have shown that therapeutic nutrition-e.g., low-protein renoprotective, hepatoprotective antioxidants, and allergen-elimination diets-holds enormous potential for treatment. In addition, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can be used as an additive therapy for resistant gastrointestinal illnesses. Despite these developments, constraints remain in terms of standardization, study duration, and species-specific data, especially for cats. This review underscores dietary modification as a clinically actionable tool for microbiota-targeted therapy and calls for integrative, multi-omics research to translate microbiome modulation into precision nutrition for companion animals.",Yang B; Zhong S; Wang J; Yu W,Microorganisms,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41471872/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41470907,S-Equol as a Gut-Derived Phytoestrogen Targeting Estrogen Receptor β: A Promising Bioactive Nutrient for Bone Health in Aging Women and Men: A Narrative Review.,"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Osteoporosis is highly prevalent and contributes substantially to morbidity and mortality, yet long-term concerns about pharmacologic therapies leave a major treatment gap. Soy isoflavones have been investigated as safer alternatives, but results across trials are inconsistent. A key unresolved issue is the equol-producer phenotype, the gut microbial ability to convert daidzein to S-equol, the most bioactive isoflavone metabolite, which may explain much of this variability. This narrative review synthesizes mechanistic, translational, and clinical evidence to clarify the potential skeletal relevance of S-equol. <b>Methods</b>: Literature was identified through PubMed and Scopus searches (January 2000-October 2025) for experimental, mechanistic, and clinical studies examining S-equol, estrogen receptor β (ERβ), and bone metabolism, with emphasis on equol-producing status, bone strength and bone microarchitecture. <b>Results</b>: S-equol acts as a high-affinity ERβ agonist with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties but lacks the carcinogenic or thrombotic risks linked to ERα activation. In estrogen-deficient rodent models, S-equol improves trabecular bone volume by 10-20%, increases trabecular number, and enhances biomechanical strength. These findings align with preclinical evidence demonstrating that S-equol preserves trabecular microarchitecture, enhances bone strength, and reduces bone turnover. A limited number of human trials show reductions in bone resorption by 20% at a daily dose of 10 mg S-equol. In contrast, trials of soy isoflavones in humans have produced inconsistent findings, partly because of substantial variability in equol-producer phenotype among participants and the reliance on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, which cannot distinguish trabecular from cortical compartments. Advanced bone imaging and microbiome-informed approaches enable the precise evaluation of S-equol's skeletal effects on trabecular bone and cortical bone, separately. <b>Conclusions</b>: S-equol represents a promising model for ""precision nutrition,"" where microbiome, hormonal, and host factors converge with potential to prevent age-related bone fragility. Rigorous trials that integrate microbiome phenotyping and advanced imaging are needed to validate this approach, translate mechanistic promise into clinical benefit, and better define safety.",Sekikawa A; Weaver A; Mroz K; Heilmann NZ; Madrid Fuentes DA; Koltun KJ; Carlson LJ; Cattell KL; Li M; Li J; Hughes TM; Strotmeyer E; Nindl B; Cauley JA,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41470907/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41470779,Sex-Specific Diet-Microbiota Interactions in Ageing: Implications for Healthy Longevity.,"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Diet-microbiota interactions shape ageing; however, their sex-specific dimensions remain poorly defined. Human studies rarely stratify analyses by sex, while most evidence of sex-dependent microbial and metabolic responses comes from preclinical models. This review synthesizes current findings on the sex-specific pathways linking diet, microbiota, and healthy ageing. <b>Methods</b>: A narrative review was conducted by integrating human observational studies, randomized controlled trials, and mechanistic animal research. Evidence was organized into four domains: (1) age-related changes in gut microbial composition; (2) microbiota-derived metabolites; (3) dietary patterns and functional nutrients; and (4) sex-specific endocrine and immunometabolism interactions influenced by the gut microbiota. <b>Results</b>: Ageing is characterized by dysbiosis, loss of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing taxa, expansion of <i>Proteobacteria</i>, and reduced production of key metabolites including butyrate, indoles, and polyamines. Dietary fiber, polyphenols, omega-3 fatty acids, and plant-based proteins help restore these pathways and mitigate inflammaging. Sex differences persist into later life: women show reduced estrobolome activity and SCFA decline after menopause, whereas men display higher levels of pro-atherogenic metabolites such as trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). Nutritional interventions, probiotics, and microbial metabolites exhibit sex-dependent responses in both human and animal studies. <b>Conclusions</b>: Diet-microbiota interactions shape ageing outcomes through sex-specific metabolic, hormonal, and immunological pathways. Incorporating sex as a biological variable is essential for developing personalized, nutrition-based strategies to support healthy ageing.",Herndez-Acosta J; Tovar AR; Torres N,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41470779/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41469211,Obesity as a Systems-Level Driver of Cancer: Mechanisms and Nutritional Reprogramming.,"Obesity has emerged as a global health crisis and a potent driver of cancer incidence and mortality, yet its mechanistic impact on tumor biology remains underappreciated. Far from being a passive risk factor, obesity acts as a systems-level oncogenic stressor, reshaping hormonal signaling, immunometabolism, and epigenetic stability across the body. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the physiological, cellular, and molecular cascades linking obesity to carcinogenesis, with emphasis on chronic inflammation, metabolic reprogramming, tumor microenvironment remodeling, and microbiome dysbiosis. We also examine how dietary patterns modulate these cancer-associated processes, positioning nutrition not merely as a preventive tool but as a programmable interphase with cancer biology through soft epigenetic reprogramming. Emerging frameworks in precision nutritional oncology, driven by nutrigenomics, metabolomics, and patient-specific molecular profiling, offer promising avenues for personalized cancer prevention and metabolic targeting. By integrating epidemiological trends, mechanistic insights, and translational strategies, we propose a paradigm shift: treating obesity not just as a comorbid risk factor but also as a modifiable oncogenic ecosystem-one that can be reprogrammed through informed, individualized precision dietary interventions.",Munteanu C; Dhanasekaran DN,Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41469211/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41461264,Food as Medicine: Enhancing Crop Breeding and Food Processing to Shift the Gut Microbiome for Prevention and Treatment of Chronic Diseases.,"Prebiotics are useful tools for shifting the gut microbiome and metabolome to confer immune, metabolic, and preventive benefits for human disease. However, there are emerging concerns about methods for discovering optimal candidate compounds and their sustainable production for long-term success in targeting mechanisms of disease. In this perspective, we review the current state of prebiotics moving from nutrition to function in health, highlighting the opportunities for using food as medicine in treating a model disease, inflammatory bowel disease, discussing the ways crop breeding can be used to identify and improve the functional (beyond nutritional) value of a prebiotic and the critical role that food processing plays in sustaining the integrity and scalability of the prebiotic compound while influencing consumer adoption of these agents. This information supports a trajectory for the future of food as medicine to be moving from population-scale dietary guidelines to personalized or precision nutrition guidelines, from ""eat more fiber"" to ""eat this specific type of fiber that has been enhanced in and processed from this specific genotype of food crop"". This could include developing designer fibers by crop breeding to develop panels of genotypes with different fiber structures that deliver reliable shifts in the microbiome and metabolome for most patients with the targeted disease. Finally, there needs to be a commitment to sustainability of the plant-derived product so that future generations will have access to the same benefits of the food as medicine initially developed for disease prevention and treatment.",Mannon PJ; Benson AK; Schnable JC; Ding W; Juritsch AF; Rose DJ,The Journal of nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41461264/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41425618,"Nutritional strategies in supporting immune checkpoint inhibitor, PI3K inhibitor, and tyrosine kinase inhibitor cancer therapies.","Nutritional status of patients undergoing cancer treatment has been associated with cancer therapy and survival outcomes across multiple therapy types. Targeted therapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors and EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), are both influenced by and themselves influence the patients' nutritional and metabolic status. Precision nutrition approaches that address specific aspects of targeted therapies, from minimizing toxicities and treatment resistance to potential therapeutic synergies, offer an important avenue to optimize clinical outcomes for patients receiving targeted oncological treatments as a part of an overall precision integrative oncology approach. Optimizing ICI treatment may necessitate gastrointestinal microbiome modulation and managing systemic inflammation with a variety of dietary approaches under study, including the Mediterranean diet, increasing fiber and fermented food intake, fasting and fasting mimicking diet and the ketogenic diet. Supplementation approaches using live biotherapeutics alongside ICIs predominate over prebiotic, postbiotic and synbiotic studies, which require further attention and investment, alongside human research on mycotherapy and fucoidan-based combinations. Optimizing PI3K treatment tolerance requires close attention to monitoring and managing glycemic control through nutrition, lifestyle and pharmacological intervention as necessary, and in supporting patients with EGFR-TKIs both nutritional prehabilitation and close attention to managing gastrointestinal toxicities is paramount. Rational individualized approaches based on detailed and dynamic clinical assessment of patient-, cancer- and treatment-related factors, using validated prognostic scores and biomarkers, are needed to maximize the potential of precision nutrition now and in future trials in this arena.",Fuller-Shavel N; Davies EJ; Peleg Hasson S,Frontiers in nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41425618/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41405656,Integrating Nutrition into Precision Medicine for Controlling Systemic Inflammation in Rheumatoid Arthritis.,"The management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has evolved from the conventional “treat-to-target” approach to strategies that emphasize individualized, patient-centered care. Concepts such as “therapeutic matchmaking” and “smart-to-target” highlight the importance of biomarkers, comorbidities, and quality-of-life priorities in selecting treatments. There is increasing evidence that identifies the gut-joint axis as a critical factor in RA pathogenesis. This axis links gut microbiota composition, intestinal barrier integrity, and systemic inflammation. Dysbiosis, reduced short-chain fatty acid production, and increased gut permeability can lead to immune dysregulation and joint inflammation. Nutritional interventions, such as high-fiber diets, prebiotics, probiotics, polyphenols, and omega-3 fatty acids, can restore microbial balance, enhance barrier function, and reduce inflammation. Precision nutrition, which tailors dietary recommendations based on genetic, microbiome, metabolic, and lifestyle factors, provides a framework for incorporating gut health into RA management. Microbiome-guided dietary strategies may improve responses to pharmacologic treatments, enable early intervention, and provide preventive benefits for high-risk individuals. Combining personalized nutrition with pharmacotherapy could optimize disease control, mitigate side effects, and promote sustainable, patient-empowering care. Future research should focus on randomized controlled trials and advanced analytic tools to refine predictive models and establish personalized nutrition as a cornerstone of holistic RA management.",Ingegnoli F; Gandolfo S; Ciccia F; Caporali R,Inflammation,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41405656/,1,0,0,0,0,0

These metabolites influence mitochondrial biogenesis, muscle energetics, epithelial barrier stability, and inflammatory regulation via G-protein-coupled receptors, AMPK-PGC-1α signaling, and epigenetic remodeling. This review synthesizes current evidence on the gut-muscle-immune axis, emphasizing how dietary fermentable substrates, microbial cross-feeding interactions, and structured exercise modulate SCFA production and shape host physiological adaptation. We integrated findings from human and animal studies, multi-omic analyses, metabolomic and microbiome research, and exercise physiology to outline mechanistic links between microbial metabolism and systemic resilience. Key mechanistic pathways connecting dietary fiber fermentation to mitochondrial function, redox regulation, immune homeostasis, and metabolic plasticity are summarized. We further present the Targeted Gut Protocol 2.0, a conceptual 12-week framework combining fiber-diversity targets, lactate-guided exercise periodization, biomarker monitoring, and adaptive feedback mechanisms to enhance endogenous SCFA availability. SCFA-driven metabolic plasticity provides an integrative model through which lifestyle behaviors can modulate host physiology.

41374074,Polyphenol-Microbiota Interactions in Atherosclerosis: The Role of Hydroxytyrosol and Tyrosol in Modulating Inflammation and Oxidative Stress.,"Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory cardiovascular disease that may result from the interaction between oxidative stress, immune dysregulation, and metabolic disorders. Recent studies indicate that the well-known phenolic compounds, hydroxytyrosol (HTyr) and tyrosol (Tyr) present in extra virgin olive oil, confer cardioprotection through various mechanisms of action that include antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and metabolic regulatory properties. The gut microbiota modulates the structure, bioavailability, and bioactivity of these phenolic compounds, thereby influencing their therapeutic potential. This review explores the intricate interactions between Tyr, HTyr, and gut microbiota within the context of atherosclerosis prevention and management. We explore how gut microbial metabolism can magnify or alter the biological effects of the Tyr and HTyr, and how interindividual differences in microbiota composition may influence their efficacy. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms could support the development of precision nutrition strategies aimed at reducing the risk of atherosclerosis.",Morvaridzadeh M; Alami M; Berrougui H; Boumezough K; Sidibé H; Salih I; Sadki K; Khalil A,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41374074/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41373948,Personalized Nutritional Assessment and Intervention for Athletes: A Network Physiology Approach.,"Nutritional assessment and intervention in athletes, a central focus of sports medicine and healthcare, has increasingly shifted in recent years toward precision nutrition-an approach that individualizes dietary recommendations according to genetic profile, microbiome composition, lifestyle factors, and health status. Despite its promising potential, this approach faces significant limitations, including the challenge of integrating complex and dynamic interactions among multilevel indicators, and the relatively high costs associated with omics technologies. The aim of this paper is to propose a nutritional assessment and intervention model grounded in the Network Physiology of Exercise, an emerging scientific field that investigates the horizontal and vertical dynamic interactions among nested physiological levels and conceptualizes athletes as complex adaptive systems (CAS). The proposal integrates social, environmental, behavioral and psychobiological information, extracted particularly from semi-structured interviews based on CAS properties. Accordingly, the traditional dietary assessment tools are replaced by open and guided interviews that allow professionals and practitioners to co-construct meaningful insights and extract qualitative data through a reflexive thematic analysis. From a CAS perspective, the multidimensional and multi-timescale personal and environmental constrains affecting their eating behavior were integrated through a hierarchically nested organization. Eliciting the dynamics of emotional contexts, behavioral patterns, and psychophysiological states, the interviews become both a method of assessment and an intervention in itself.",Prieto A; Lizarraga MA; Balagué N,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41373948/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Mounting evidence highlights the ""gut microbiota-short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-motility"" axis as a central pathophysiological link between dysbiosis and impaired colonic transit. This review synthesizes current knowledge of how SCFAs, especially acetate, propionate and butyrate, shape motility through serotonergic signaling, enteric nervous system modulation, epithelial barrier integrity and immune regulation. Particular attention is devoted to the biased-signaling properties of the SCFA receptors FFAR2 and FFAR3 (free fatty acid receptors 2 and 3, respectively), including emerging data on their heterodimerization. The article then appraises recent randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses of multi-target interventions (dietary fibers, synbiotics, postbiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, phytochemicals, and small-molecule FFAR agonists) highlighting their efficacy, safety, and translational hurdles. Finally, the authors propose a precision-medicine framework that integrates multi-omics microbiome profiling, metabolomics, and host genetics to enable phenotype-stratified therapy. Key research gaps include limited long-term safety data, heterogeneous human cohorts and the need for large multicenter trials and machine-learning-guided responder prediction.

41364914,Microbe-Diet Interactions and Personalized Nutrition.,"Nutrition plays a fundamental role in shaping human health across the life course, influencing both host physiology and the composition and function of the gut microbiota. In turn, the gut microbiota modulates the effects of dietary intake, creating complex bidirectional interactions with profound implications for metabolic health. Although the concept of personalized nutrition offering tailored dietary advice based on observable traits, environmental factors, and genotype has gained prominence, growing evidence supports the promise of precision nutrition that also considers individual microbiome profiles. This approach is particularly relevant for addressing diet-related conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, where interindividual variability in response to the same diet is well documented. Advances in high-throughput sequencing, metabolomics, and machine learning are driving predictive models that can forecast personalized dietary outcomes. However, methodological heterogeneity, lack of consistency, and limited representation of diverse populations in current studies present significant barriers. Ethical challenges, including data privacy and equitable access to personalized nutrition tools, also warrant urgent attention. To realize the full potential of microbiome-informed nutrition, greater harmonization of research methods, robust validation across large and diverse cohorts, and an interdisciplinary framework are essential.",Kujawska M; Hall LJ,Annual review of food science and technology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41364914/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41338994,Chemical recognition of phytochemicals and microbiota-derived metabolites in the gut and implication for physiological function in the body.,"The gastrointestinal (GI) tract serves as a dynamic chemosensory interface that integrates signals from dietary phytochemicals and microbiota-derived metabolites to regulate host physiology. Beyond digestion and absorption, specialized epithelial and enteroendocrine cells detect luminal compounds via receptors such as taste (sweet, bitter), olfactory, and transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. Phytochemicals - including terpenoids, glycosides, flavonoids, and volatile compounds - activate these receptors to modulate gut hormone secretion, appetite, energy balance, and immune function. Similarly, microbiota-derived metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, and tryptophan derivatives act through G protein-coupled and nuclear receptors to coordinate metabolic, immune, and neuroendocrine processes. Together, these receptor-mediated pathways form a complex communication network linking diet, microbes, and host signaling systems, influencing metabolic health and disease.

41330454,Circadian rhythms and gut microbiota Dysbiosis: emerging gut-brain axis pathways in insomnia pathophysiology and Therapeutics.,"Insomnia, a widespread sleep disorder, significantly impacts mental and physical health. Emerging research highlights the crucial role of gut microbiota (GM) in modulating circadian rhythms (CR), which regulate sleep-wake cycles. This review explores the interplay between GM dysbiosis, CR disruptions, and insomnia, synthesizing findings from human and animal studies. GM dysbiosis is linked to reduced microbial diversity and altered abundance of key taxa, such as short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria, which influence clock gene expression and hormonal rhythms. CR disruption exacerbates GM imbalances, forming a feedback loop that impairs sleep regulation through both central and peripheral pathways. We also examine the therapeutic potential of probiotics in restoring GM balance and synchronizing CR. Clinical trials suggest that specific probiotic strains improve sleep quality by modulating microbial metabolites and their downstream effects on the circadian system. However, inconsistencies in outcomes underscore the need for precision interventions.

41305652,Hidden Hunger in Pediatric Obesity: Redefining Malnutrition Through Macronutrient Quality and Micronutrient Deficiency.,"<b>Background:</b> Pediatric obesity exemplifies the paradox of energy excess coexisting with nutritional inadequacy. Despite high caloric intake, children with obesity often display deficiencies in essential macro- and micronutrients that impair growth, metabolic regulation, and long-term health. This review critically examines the mechanisms underlying malnutrition in pediatric obesity, emphasizing the interplay between dietary quality, inflammation, microbiota alterations, and biomarker profiles, and identifies research gaps limiting precision nutrition approaches. <b>Methods:</b> A comprehensive narrative review of studies addressing macro- and micronutrient intake, metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers, and gut microbiota-host interactions in pediatric obesity was conducted. Evidence from both clinical and experimental models was integrated to evaluate mechanistic pathways, diagnostic criteria, and preventive strategies. <b>Results:</b> Obesity-related malnutrition arises from poor dietary quality, systemic inflammation, and microbiota dysbiosis, leading to impaired nutrient utilization and metabolic dysfunction. Deficiencies in vitamin D, calcium, iron, magnesium, and B vitamins are common and often coexist with macronutrient imbalances. Diets rich in saturated fats and refined carbohydrates exacerbate inflammation and metabolic risk, whereas plant-based proteins, unsaturated fats, and fiber support metabolic resilience. Precision nutrition and biomarker-guided monitoring show promise but require validation in pediatric cohorts. Evidence on microbiota modulation and nutrient-gene interactions remains inconsistent, reflecting methodological heterogeneity. <b>Conclusions:</b> Malnutrition in pediatric obesity should be recognized as a distinct clinical phenotype characterized by qualitative nutrient deficiency within a state of energy surplus. Addressing this paradox demands harmonized diagnostic criteria, longitudinal biomarker surveillance, and individualized dietary strategies informed by genetics and microbiome profiling. Multilevel interventions, linking clinical practice, policy, and food system reform, are essential to prevent lifelong metabolic complications and promote healthy growth trajectories.",Dargenio VN; Sgarro N; La Grasta G; Begucci M; Castellaneta SP; Dargenio C; Paulucci L; Francavilla R; Cristofori F,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41305652/,1,0,0,0,0,1

In this perspective, we emphasize the broad systemic impact of IBD-from highly prevalent conditions such as anemia, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, or fatigue to rare but severe complications like interstitial lung disease and drug-induced glomerulonephritis. We review underlying mechanisms linking gut inflammation to distant organs, including immune dysregulation, microbial translocation, and metabolic derangements. Advances in diagnostics-such as biomarker panels, high-resolution imaging, and genomic/microbiome profiling-enable early detection and risk stratification. Emerging therapies, including targeted biologics (anti-TNF, anti-integrin, anti-IL-23), JAK and S1P modulators, precision nutrition, and microbiome modulation, offer new opportunities to address systemic inflammation.

While advances in multi-omic integration have revolutionized our understanding of adiposity pathways, translation into personalized clinical nutrition remains a critical challenge. This review systematically consolidates emerging insights into the molecular and nutrigenomic architecture of obesity by integrating data from large-scale GWAS, functional epigenomics, nutrigenetic interactions, and microbiome-mediated metabolic programming. The primary aim is to systematically organize and synthesize recent genetic and genomic findings in obesity, while also highlighting how these discoveries can be contextualized within precision nutrition frameworks. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science up to July 2024 using MeSH terms, nutrigenomic-specific queries, and multi-omics filters. Eligible studies were classified into five domains: monogenic obesity, polygenic GWAS findings, epigenomic regulation, nutrigenomic signatures, and gut microbiome contributions. Over 127 candidate genes and 253 QTLs have been implicated in obesity susceptibility. Monogenic variants (e.g., <i>LEP</i>, <i>LEPR</i>, <i>MC4R</i>, <i>POMC</i>, <i>PCSK1</i>) explain rare, early-onset phenotypes, while <i>FTO</i> (polygenic) and <i>MC4R</i> (monogenic mutations as well as common polygenic variants) represent major loci across populations. Epigenetic mechanisms, dietary composition, physical activity, and microbial diversity significantly recalibrate obesity trajectories. Integration of genomics, functional epigenomics, precision nutrigenomics, and microbiome science presents transformative opportunities for personalized obesity interventions. However, translation into evidence-based clinical nutrition remains limited, emphasizing the need for functional validation, cross-ancestry mapping, and AI-driven precision frameworks.

The contemporary surge in detection rates, which has increased over the past decade, correlates with global dietary paradigm shifts, including the growth in plant-based diet adoption and the concurrent rise in metabolic dysfunction. This comprehensive review synthesizes current understanding of hypercarotenemia pathophysiology through systematic literature analysis encompassing molecular mechanisms, epidemiological trends, clinical phenotypes, and therapeutic interventions, with particular emphasis on genetic discoveries and precision management approaches. Hypercarotenemia pathogenesis involves sophisticated interactions among three key mechanistic pathways: (1) intestinal absorption via SR-B1 receptors, (2) enzymatic conversion through β-carotene oxygenase 1 and 2 (Beta-carotene oxygenase 1 (BCO1)/BCO2) systems, and (3) genetic susceptibility primarily mediated by BCO1 variants (rs6564851, rs12934922, rs7501331). The condition demonstrates remarkable clinical heterogeneity influenced by individual metabolic capacity, intestinal microbiome composition, and concurrent endocrinopathies, particularly thyroid dysfunction and diabetes mellitus. The management paradigms have evolved from simple dietary restriction to precision nutrition approaches, integrating genetic profiling with individualized tolerance thresholds while preserving established health benefits of carotenoid-rich diets. Standard diagnostic criteria incorporate both biochemical thresholds and functional assessments, including the retinol:β-carotene molar ratio as a functional measure of BCO1 activity. Although traditionally considered benign, hypercarotenemia serves as a valuable biomarker for underlying metabolic dysfunction and genetic variants affecting fat-soluble vitamin homeostasis, warranting clinical attention for risk stratification and personalized dietary counseling.",Wang Z; Xu J; Xu G; Sha Y; Wang K; Chen G,Cureus,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41246777/,1,0,0,0,0,0

It investigates how different biological datasets-like genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and gut microbiome profiles-can be combined to create customized dietary plans. By reviewing scientific literature from 2015 to 2025, the study highlights how knowledge graphs help map complex biological interactions and how GNNs effectively analyze and interpret graph-based multi-omics information. The review demonstrates that knowledge graphs provide an elastic and scalable model for representing multi-relational biological information; however, GNNs enable the identification of complex non-local relationships between omics layers that cannot be detected using conventional statistics. The most significant benefits include improved forecast accuracy of individual responses to diet, enhanced biomarker discovery, and the potential for the development of customized nutritional therapy based on detailed characterization of the individual through comprehensive biological profiling. Nevertheless, several issues require further attention, including the quality and standardization of data across omics platforms, scalability uncertainty in computational models, interpretability shortcomings of models, and the ethical challenges associated with the use of personal genetic information. In this review, case studies are provided for comparing the graph-based approach with traditional methods and demonstrating how these methods outperform in terms of their capability to capture biological complexity. Future directions emphasize the importance of international cooperation, the utilization of technology in computational processes with potential for scalability, the development of models that are easier to interpret, and adherence to acceptable ethical standards: knowledge graphs and GNNs.

While there has been progress in the development of pharmacologic treatments, lifestyle and dietary interventions remain as the first-line approach for management. This scoping review aimed to identify dietary strategies for managing MASLD and to highlight current research gaps and challenges. <b>Methods</b>: A systematic search of PubMed and Science Direct was conducted up to 10 July 2025, for relevant studies on dietary modifications and MASLD. Data extracted included types of interventions, outcomes related to liver health, and research limitations. <b>Results</b>: Dietary interventions were shown to consistently improve hepatic and metabolic outcomes. In a randomized controlled trial of 12 weeks (<i>n</i> = 259), a Mediterranean diet reduced hepatic steatosis by 39% and improved insulin sensitivity. A calorie-restricted lifestyle program in adults with MASLD (<i>n</i> = 196) reduced liver fat by 25% over 52 weeks. Resistant starch supplementation (<i>n</i> = 200) lowered intrahepatic triglyceride content by 8% through gut microbiome modulation. A pilot RCT of medically tailored meals in cirrhosis (<i>n</i> = 40) reduced ascites symptoms and improved quality of life. Finally, prebiotic supplementation in MASLD (<i>n</i> = 200) lowered systemic inflammation and increased immune-regulating microbes.

Spatacsin, the protein encoded by the SPG11 gene, plays a critical role in autophagy and lysosomal homeostasis, which are essential for neuronal health. Its impairment leads to defective cellular clearance and neurodegeneration. Recently, personalized and precision nutrition have emerged as promising approaches to enhance clinical outcomes by tailoring dietary interventions to individual genetic, metabolic, and phenotypic profiles. <b>Objectives:</b> This mini scoping review aimed to synthesize current evidence on the application of personalized and precision nutrition in SPG11 and to explore how insights from related neurodegenerative diseases could inform the development of future dietary and metabolic interventions for this rare disorder. <b>Methods:</b> Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, a scoping review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases (2020-2024).

41190158,Nutrient metabolism and complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus: implications for rehabilitation and precision care.,"Systemic disruptions in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and micronutrients cause micro- and macro-vascular damage and impede recovery, which is the driving force behind type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Neuropathy, nephropathy, foot ulcers, and sarcopenia are symptoms of persistent hyperglycemia, lipotoxicity, excess branched-chain amino acids, and deficiencies in magnesium, zinc, and vitamin D that impair insulin signaling, mitochondrial integrity, and tissue repair. Functional decline is accelerated in skeletal muscle and peripheral nerves due to advanced glycation end-product deposition, ectopic lipid accumulation, and impaired glucose uptake. Micronutrient deficiency hinders wound healing and immune function, while altered nitrogen handling and progressive albuminuria intensify catabolism in the kidney. Controlled protein intake, micronutrient replacement, and microbiome-informed precision diets are targeted nutritional interventions that reduce complications by preserving renal function, restoring nerve integrity, and promoting wound closure. By combining machine learning analytics with continuous glucose monitoring, macronutrient ratios can be changed in real time, improving individualized care. Improved mobility, less neuropathic pain, and better glycaemic control are the results of integrating systematic nutritional assessment and treatment into multidisciplinary rehabilitation protocols. The translation in standard practice continues to be obstructed by inconsistent evaluation tools, lack of availability of omics technologies and few nurse-led randomized trials.

Unlike targeted assays restricted to predefined metabolites, untargeted strategies capture broad metabolic perturbations across lipid, carbohydrate, amino acid, and nucleotide pathways, enabling the discovery of novel biomarkers and unanticipated physiological mechanisms. This review critically evaluates the design and application of untargeted metabolomic pipelines in the context of exercise and nutrition science, from pre-analytical sample handling and analytical platforms such as NMR, LC-MS, and GC-MS, to data processing using tools like XCMS, MZmine, and MS-DIAL, and subsequent statistical and bioinformatic interpretation. Key applications include delineating acute metabolic shocks induced by endurance exercise, identifying athlete-specific metabolic phenotypes shaped by chronic training, and assessing the impact of nutritional interventions such as fruit intake, amino acid supplementation, or polyphenol-rich foods on exercise recovery and oxidative stress. The integration of metabolomics with other omics, particularly microbiome metagenomics and lipidomics, highlights the potential for systems-level insights into host-microbe-diet interactions. Nonetheless, significant challenges remain, including the reproducibility of findings, difficulties in metabolite identification, and the translational gap between large datasets and actionable nutritional strategies. By synthesizing current strengths, limitations, and controversies, this review emphasizes that the future of sports metabolomics lies in methodological standardization, multi-omics integration, and validation of candidate biomarkers in independent cohorts.

Diet influences gut microbiome composition, which regulates epigenetic modifications affecting inflammation, metabolism, and disease susceptibility. Precision nutrition seeks to personalize dietary strategies based on these interactions, yet the role of microbiome-driven epigenetic regulation remains under investigation. A systematic review was conducted in 2025 following PRISMA guidelines. Studies exploring the relationship between dietary interventions, gut microbiome composition, and epigenetic changes were identified via PubMed and Google Scholar. Thirty-five studies, including randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and observational research, met the inclusion criteria.

Among emerging approaches, dietary interventions targeting the gut-brain axis have garnered considerable attention, owing to their potential to modulate key pathogenic pathways underlying neurodegenerative processes. This review synthesizes current concepts in precision nutrition and elucidates neurohumoral, immune, and metabolic regulatory mechanisms mediated by the gut microbiota, including the roles of the vagus nerve, cytokines, short-chain fatty acids, vitamins, polyphenols, and microbial metabolites. Emerging evidence underscores that dysbiotic alterations contribute to compromised barrier integrity, the initiation and perpetuation of neuroinflammatory responses, pathological protein aggregations, and the progressive course of neurodegenerative diseases.

41096907,"Dietary and Pharmacological Modulation of Aging-Related Metabolic Pathways: Molecular Insights, Clinical Evidence, and a Translational Model.","Advances in geroscience suggest that aging is modulated by molecular pathways that are amenable to dietary and pharmacological intervention. We conducted an integrative critical review of caloric restriction (CR), intermittent fasting (IF), and caloric restriction mimetics (CR-mimetics) to compare shared mechanisms, clinical evidence, limitations, and translational potential. Across modalities, CR and IF consistently activate AMP-activated protein kinase and sirtuins, inhibit mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) signaling, and enhance autophagy, aligning with improvements in insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, low-grade inflammation, and selected epigenetic aging measures in humans. CR-mimetics, such as metformin, resveratrol, rapamycin, and spermidine, partially reproduce these effects; however, long-term safety and efficacy in healthy populations remain incompletely defined. Methodological constraints-short trial duration, selective samples, intermediate (nonclinical) endpoints, and limited adherence monitoring-impede definitive conclusions on hard outcomes (frailty, disability, hospitalization, mortality). We propose the Active Management of Aging and Longevity (AMAL) model, a three-level biomarker-guided framework that integrates personalized diet, chrono-nutrition, exercise, and the selective use of CR-mimetics, along with digital monitoring and decision support. AMAL emphasizes epigenetic clocks, multi-omics profiling, inflammatory and microbiome metrics, and adaptive protocols to enhance adherence and clinical relevance. Overall, CR, IF, and CR mimetics constitute promising, complementary strategies to modulate biological aging; rigorous long-term trials with standardized biomarkers and clinically meaningful endpoints are needed to enable their scalable implementation.",Murillo-Cancho AF; Lozano-Paniagua D; Nievas-Soriano BJ,International journal of molecular sciences,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41096907/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41056462,"Precision Nutritional Genomics, Gut Microbiota and Artificial Intelligence in Chronic Kidney Disease.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a prevalent global health issue, and nutritional management of CKD is an integral component through all stages of the disease. However, response to dietary interventions varies, potentially due to genetic variations influencing metabolic pathways. This review highlights key gene-diet interactions relevant to CKD management, including risk factors and comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and proteinuria. Variants in the <i>ACE</i> gene influence salt sensitivity and blood pressure responses, while <i>TCF7L2</i> polymorphisms affect the relationship between dietary glycemic load and diabetes risk, impacting kidney complications. Protein intake, a key modifier of CKD, correlates with proteinuria risk, moderated by a <i>PPM1K</i> polymorphism. Dietary bioactives, such as caffeine, may also alter the progression rate of proteinuria and hypertension, with effects contingent upon <i>CYP1A2</i> genotype. Additional markers of cardiovascular disease, CKD-associated bone-mineral disease, and CKD anemia are also discussed as well as role of the gut microbiome in nutrition modulation and vice versa. The review concludes with the potential of artificial intelligence as a clinical tool to refine precision nutrition, enabling clinicians to adopt targeted approaches, stratified by genetic-metabolic patient profiles that match best nutritional interventions for prevention and management of CKD. Vitamin D is used as a model nutrient to illustrate a simulated framework for precision nutrition, incorporating molecular mechanisms, genetic variation, epigenetic modifications, and translational tools applicable to both population health and clinical practice.",Mahdavi S,Journal of the American Nutrition Association,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41056462/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41043686,Ingestive Behavior and Precision Nutrition: Part of the Puzzle.,"The marked individual variability in response to common dietary exposures necessitates tailoring of dietary guidance to individuals, or small groups of individuals with similar needs, to optimize health. This is a complex task requiring integration of environmental, cultural, psychological, and biological contributions. Work in the area of precision nutrition is an effort to translate science into practice. A research roadmap developed through a National Institutes of Health conference identified many of the inputs that require quantification. Better characterization of ingestive behaviors is one key area. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize current understanding of the influences of age, sex, body mass index, ethnicity, and genetics on ingestive behaviors, including culture, sensory function, appetite, dietary intake, the gut-brain axis, and microbiome. To do so, the extant literature was accessed through search engines relevant to the various topics covered. Outcomes assessed varied topically. In addition to compiling evidence on the nature and magnitude of these relationships, this review highlights the degree of individual variability in attributes or responses to an intervention. More broadly, it documents: 1) that cause-and-effect relationships are difficult to establish as most are dynamic and interactive; 2) there are inherent and learned contributions to both behavior and biology that will require different considerations and offer different opportunities for manipulation; 3) a focus on intuitive approaches may not be as successful as desired; 4) that external influences can, and often do, override internal influences of biology; and 5) there are multiple ways to construct healthful diets. At the same time, it is vital that improved methods to characterize the multiple relevant inputs to ingestive behavior be developed. It is hoped that the evidence compiled here will inform efforts to develop precision nutrition guidance.",Biruete A; Buobu PS; Considine RV; Met Hoxha E; Eicher-Miller HA; Kinzig KP; Panjwani AA; Running CA; Rutigliani G; Savaiano DA; Veile A; Wolf PG; Mattes RD,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41043686/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Considering the extensive research on AX in piglet nutrition, this paper systematically reviews their impacts on gut health and microbiota in piglets, as well as the underlying mechanisms of action. AX have been shown to mediate gut barrier fortification through tight junction protein upregulation and orchestrate mucosal immunity homeostasis, consequently ameliorating early-weaning-associated diarrheal pathogenesis in piglets. Additionally, AX function as microbial ecological modulators through selective enrichment of beneficial commensal microbiota (e.g. <i>Bifidobacterium</i> spp. and <i>Lactobacillus</i> spp.), while simultaneously stimulating microbial biosynthesis of SCFA and ferulic acid exhibiting potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity, thereby maintaining the intestinal health of piglets. This review offers valuable insights into their potential as a dietary intervention to support gut health and immune function in early-weaned piglets. However, most studies focus on single-source AX such as wheat or maize, with limited exploration of novel sources or comparative effects of source combinations. Future research should systematically investigate the molecular mechanisms of AX action, provide data-driven guidance for selecting AX sources in feed formulations and establish optimal inclusion levels in practical feeding regimens. Such efforts will further solidify the precision nutrition potential of AX in promoting sustainable and healthy growth in piglets.",Yi H; Pu Y; Wang Y; Xie Z; Feng L; Zhou P; Zhang Y; Liu J; Diao H; Yan H,The British journal of nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41039801/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41035896,The human microbiome in clinical translation: from bench to bedside.,"The human microbiome, once regarded as a passive passenger, is now recognized as a dynamic and essential determinant of human physiology, shaping immunity, metabolism, neurodevelopment, and therapeutic responsiveness across the lifespan. Advances in multi-omic technologies, experimental models, and computational approaches have revealed mechanistic insights into how microbial communities modulate host systems across diverse body sites, including the gut, skin, lungs, oral cavity, and reproductive tract. The clinical translation of this knowledge has begun to redefine early-life programming, cardiometabolic regulation, immune homeostasis, neuropsychiatric resilience, and cancer therapy response. Innovative strategies such as phage therapy, live biotherapeutics, precision nutrition, and microbiota transplantation illustrate the therapeutic potential of harnessing microbial functions to prevent or treat disease. In parallel, large-scale initiatives cataloging the microbiome of underexplored niches, such as the vagina and skin, are advancing health equity by broadening representation in microbial reference datasets. Yet significant challenges persist, including interindividual variability, incomplete functional annotation of microbial ""dark matter,"" and the absence of validated biomarkers. Addressing these gaps requires standardized methodologies, harmonized regulatory frameworks, and longitudinal studies across diverse populations. This review outlines the progress and remaining hurdles in translating microbiome science into clinical practice and concludes that the microbiome now stands at the forefront of a paradigm shift, transforming concepts of disease etiology, therapeutic design, and the future of individualized medicine.",Bautista J; Echeverría CE; Maldonado-Noboa I; Ojeda-Mosquera S; Hidalgo-Tinoco C; López-Cortés A,Frontiers in microbiology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41035896/,1,0,0,0,0,1
41027346,Comparing apples to apples: Evaluating foodomics in precision nutrition research featuring the influence of polyphenols on the gut microbiome.,"This review aimed to evaluate the use of advanced omics methodologies in dietary intervention clinical trials investigating the influence of polyphenols on the gut microbiome. All published clinical studies in the Cochrane Library database from 2014 to 2024 containing the keywords ""polyphenols"" and ""gut microbiome"" were compiled and categorized based on experimental design, analytical methodologies, and findings. We found that despite known variability in food composition across agricultural and processing parameters, omics analysis of the food used in clinical nutrition interventions has not been widely embraced. None of the studies evaluated employed untargeted omics approaches for food composition analysis, while 5 of the 38 studies used untargeted omics for clinical samples analysis. Targeted analytical methods focused on known compounds or proxies were more commonly used for food composition analysis (18 of 38 studies) and clinical samples (24 of 38 studies), though analysis of clinical samples focused on a greater number of target compounds. Data from these studies support relationships between the gut microbiome, clinical outcomes, and specific metabolites. However, several studies highlight inconsistencies between their findings and previous literature, which may be attributed to unrealized differences in polyphenol composition. We propose that inclusion of comprehensive omics-based food composition analyses in dietary intervention clinical trials may increase study value by accounting for variability in food composition and enabling novel discovery. Such data would support the emerging fields of personalized and precision nutrition, aimed at understanding the influence of individual human characteristics on physiological responses to foods, nutrients, phytochemicals, and dietary patterns.",Keohane E; Prenni J; Johnson SA; Van Buiten C,"Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41027346/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41019326,Metabolic regulation of obesity by naturally occurring compounds: mechanisms and therapeutic potential.,"The global obesity epidemic continues to escalate, driving demands for safer and more effective therapeutic strategies. This review evaluates the potential of natural bioactive compounds as multi-targeted interventions for obesity management. Plant-derived polyphenols (e.g., epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), resveratrol), alkaloids (e.g., berberine), and marine carotenoids (e.g., fucoxanthin) demonstrate remarkable capacity to modulate fundamental obesity pathways through (A) suppression of adipogenesis via PPARγ and C/EBPα inhibition, (B) activation of lipolysis through hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) stimulation and AMPK phosphorylation, (C) enhancement of thermogenesis via UCP1 upregulation, and (D) gut microbiome modulation through SCFA production. Clinical evidence supports the efficacy of selected compounds, with green tea catechins showing 4% to 5% body fat reduction and berberine demonstrating significant metabolic improvements. These natural agents offer distinct advantages over conventional drugs through their pleiotropic mechanisms and favorable safety profiles. However, bioavailability limitations and inter-individual variability present significant challenges. Innovative delivery systems, including nanoencapsulation and phospholipid complexes, show promise to enhance the therapeutic potential. The review highlights emerging strategies combining microbiome modulation with precision nutrition approaches while emphasizing the need for standardized clinical protocols. By bridging ethnopharmacological knowledge with modern scientific validation, natural compounds represent a promising avenue to develop sustainable, multi-targeted anti-obesity therapies that address both physiological and metabolic aspects of this complex disorder.",Das M; Yagnik U; Raninga I; Banerjee D,Frontiers in endocrinology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41019326/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41009354,"A Comprehensive Review of the Triangular Relationship Among Diet, Gut Microbiota, and Aging.","Aging is a complex biological process influenced by internal and external factors, with diet and gut microbiota emerging as pivotal, interconnected modulators. This review explores their triangular relationship, emphasizing how they dynamically interact to shape health across the lifespan. Aging involves notable shifts in gut microbiota, including reduced diversity, increased pro-inflammatory taxa, and impaired production of key metabolites, like short-chain fatty acids. These changes contribute to systemic inflammation, immune-senescence, and age-related conditions, such as cognitive decline and metabolic disorders. Diet, particularly Mediterranean and plant-based patterns, plays a critical role in modulating gut microbiota by enhancing beneficial microbes and their metabolic functions. In contrast, Western-style diets rich in saturated fats and processed foods promote dysbiosis and accelerate aging. The review synthesizes evidence from human studies, animal models, and interventions to show how microbiota mediates diet-driven effects on aging. It also explores the role of specific nutrients, fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, and polyphenols in influencing microbial and host aging biology. Emerging therapies, including probiotics, prebiotics, and precision nutrition, show promise for promoting healthy aging by restoring microbial balance. However, gaps remain, including the need for long-term, age-specific studies, standardized microbiome protocols, and integrated omics approaches to support targeted longevity strategies.",Ramasinghe C; Bordiga M; Xu B,International journal of molecular sciences,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41009354/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41007736,The Gut Microbiome in Human Obesity: A Comprehensive Review.,"An estimated 2.6 billion individuals are currently living with overweight or obesity, and this number is projected to exceed 4 billion by 2035. Consequently, unless this increasing trajectory is effectively addressed, the trend is expected to continue in the coming years. The gut microbiome has emerged as a central regulator of host metabolism and energy homeostasis, making its detailed characterization crucial for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies and for elucidating mechanisms underlying metabolic health and disease. This review examines human obesity through the lens of the gut microbiome, providing a comprehensive overview of its role by addressing gut microbiome alterations, microbiome-driven mechanisms, dietary influences, prebiotic effects, microbiome-based therapeutics, and other approaches in the treatment of obesity and related metabolic disorders. The composition of the gut microbiome is altered in obesity and characterized by reduced microbial diversity and inconsistent shifts in dominant bacterial phyla, which collectively contribute to metabolic dysregulation. The gut microbiome influences obesity through multiple mechanisms. These include regulating energy balance and insulin sensitivity via short-chain fatty acids, inducing chronic inflammation, modulating metabolic and appetite genes, altering bile acid signaling, and promoting fat storage by inhibiting fasting-induced adipose factor. Dietary patterns exert a profound influence on gut microbiome composition and function, with plant-based diets conferring protective effects against obesity and its comorbidities. Microbiome-based therapeutics, including probiotics, synbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation, have demonstrated potential in modulating key metabolic and inflammatory pathways associated with obesity. As the scientific understanding of the human gut microbiome continues to advance, the integration of microbiome-based therapies into standard clinical practice is poised to become increasingly feasible and therapeutically transformative, particularly for obesity, a complex condition that demands innovative and customized interventions.",Borrego-Ruiz A; Borrego JJ,Biomedicines,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41007736/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40953839,Gut Microbiota-Targeted Polyphenol Interventions: A Novel Paradigm and Synergistic Strategies for Obesity Management.,"Obesity has emerged as a major metabolic disorder threatening global public health, with gut microbiota (GM) dysbiosis recognized as a key pathogenic driver. While existing reviews have explored associations between GM and obesity (e.g., the gut-liver axis), this review focuses specifically on polyphenols to establish a novel paradigm of ""GM-targeted polyphenol interventions."" Naturally occurring polyphenols exhibit unique advantages in obesity management; however, their systemic effects critically depend on GM-mediated biotransformation. Herein, we propose the ""Polyphenol-GM Axis"" as the core mechanism underpinning polyphenol efficacy against obesity, synthesizing and integrating current evidence. This comprehensive review elucidates how polyphenols from diverse sources ameliorate obesity through GM modulation: (1) remodeling gut-liver crosstalk via bile acid metabolism; (2) inhibiting lipogenesis through GM-derived metabolites; (3) restoring intestinal barrier integrity; (4) blocking inflammatory cascades. We elucidate causal relationships between polyphenol-induced GM shifts and host metabolic outcomes, revealing targeted pathways for bidirectional ""microbiota-host"" regulation. Critically, we propose that combining GM-targeted polyphenol interventions with lifestyle modifications (diet/exercise) enables precision nutrition. This paradigm provides a theoretical foundation for developing polyphenol-based therapeutics beyond nutritional supplements. Future research should prioritize personalized GM modulation and structural optimization of polyphenols to accelerate their translation from functional foods to clinical agents for obesity management.",Cai Y; Xu J; Wang B,Phytotherapy research : PTR,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40953839/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40947184,Ideal dietary fiber model: Personalized gut microbiota modulation based on structure-function relationships.,"Dietary fiber has emerged as a central modulator of gut microbiota composition and host physiology, garnering unprecedented scientific attention. Here, we propose the ""Ideal Dietary Fiber Model""-a personalized, structure-guided framework designed to precisely shape gut microbial ecosystems and promote host health. Departing from traditional fiber classifications, this model emphasizes the construction of composite fiber formulations based on detailed structural parameters, including monosaccharide composition, glycosidic linkage types, and degree of polymerization. Particular focus is given to oligosaccharides, whose fine structural features confer high selectivity in modulating microbial communities and the production of key metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, indoles, and neurotransmitter precursors. This review synthesizes recent advances in fiber-microbiota interactions across metabolic, inflammatory, and neurocognitive diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, depression, anxiety, and Alzheimer's disease. While mechanistic insights continue to expand, current evidence remains largely preclinical, highlighting the gap between experimental findings and clinical translation. We argue that integrating microbiome stratification with fiber structure-function databases will be essential for advancing precision nutrition. The Ideal Dietary Fiber Model offers a conceptual and practical foundation for microbiota-targeted dietary design, but its therapeutic potential requires rigorous clinical validation.",Wang C; Qin S; Shi J; Zhu J; Ju X; Wang W; Yang L,Carbohydrate polymers,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40947184/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40944699,"Interplay between (poly)phenols, gut microbiota, and biological rhythms: outlook for a new paradigm in brain health.","Dietary (poly)phenols, bioactive compounds abundantly found in plant-based foods, undergo extensive metabolism by the host and its gut microbiota, producing metabolites that influence systemic and brain health. Despite their low bioavailability, (poly)phenols have been consistently associated with neuroprotective benefits, such as reducing neuroinflammation and enhancing gut-brain communication. Additionally, circadian rhythms can influence (poly)phenol bioactivity, while these compounds, in turn, modulate biological rhythms. The gut microbiota's diurnal oscillations affect (poly)phenol metabolism and modulate (poly)phenols' effects by producing bioactive metabolites, adding complexity to their health impact. Understanding these mechanisms can aid in designing functional foods and precision nutrition strategies to enhance neuroprotection. However, critical questions remain unanswered. This review explores the interplay between (poly)phenols, circadian rhythms, and gut microbiota, highlighting their collective role in brain health. The influence of individual gut microbiota profiles, polyphenol-related metabotypes, and circadian synchrony on (poly)phenol metabolism and neuroprotection is not fully understood. Likewise, the timing of (poly)phenol consumption and its interaction with rhythmic microbial processes require further exploration. Addressing these gaps could lead to targeted dietary interventions.

This review aims to summarize and critically evaluate evidence from both preclinical and clinical studies on the immunomodulatory effects of these compounds. A structured literature search was performed across major scientific databases in accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Seventy studies met the predefined eligibility criteria and were included. Evidence indicates that functional ingredients support immune function via antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and microbiome-mediated pathways. Clinical trials further report benefits including a reduced risk of respiratory infections and enhanced vaccine responses. Nonetheless, important challenges remain regarding bioavailability, inter-individual variability, and the long-term safety of supplementation. Emerging research on precision nutrition and innovative delivery systems may further enhance the efficacy of these bioactive compounds.

Several studies have shown that protein intake is a key modulator of cognitive function. The development of precision nutrition has allowed the study of specific amino acids within proteins, with many studies reporting that the level of methionine (Met) intake plays a central role in modulating cognitive function. Methionine has both beneficial and detrimental effects on cognitive function, depending on various factors, and a comprehensive summary of its effects on brain health is urgently required. Here, the effects of different Met intakes on cognitive function were systematically reviewed. The effects of Met on learning and memory are strongly correlated with different intervention doses and periods, and the sex, age, and physiological status of the recipients. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying the effects of Met were discussed, which acts through reduction-oxidation homeostasis, gut microbiota alterations, and epigenetic modifications. Moreover, methods of altering Met levels in the body are comprehensively summarized, and strategy for achieving precise Met nutrition was summarized and proposed. In summary, precise Met nutrition for cognitive function is important.

40871725,Integrating Precision Medicine and Digital Health in Personalized Weight Management: The Central Role of Nutrition.,"Obesity is a global health challenge marked by substantial inter-individual differences in responses to dietary and lifestyle interventions. Traditional weight loss strategies often overlook critical biological variations in genetics, metabolic profiles, and gut microbiota composition, contributing to poor adherence and variable outcomes. Our primary aim is to identify key biological and behavioral effectors relevant to precision medicine for weight control, with a particular focus on nutrition, while also discussing their current and potential integration into digital health platforms. Thus, this review aligns more closely with the identification of influential factors within precision medicine (e.g., genetic, metabolic, and microbiome factors) but also explores how these factors are currently integrated into digital health tools. We synthesize recent advances in nutrigenomics, nutritional metabolomics, and microbiome-informed nutrition, highlighting how tailored dietary strategies-such as high-protein, low-glycemic, polyphenol-enriched, and fiber-based diets-can be aligned with specific genetic variants (e.g., FTO and MC4R), metabolic phenotypes (e.g., insulin resistance), and gut microbiota profiles (e.g., <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> abundance, SCFA production). In parallel, digital health tools-including mobile health applications, wearable devices, and AI-supported platforms-enhance self-monitoring, adherence, and dynamic feedback in real-world settings. Mechanistic pathways such as gut-brain axis regulation, microbial fermentation, gene-diet interactions, and anti-inflammatory responses are explored to explain inter-individual differences in dietary outcomes. However, challenges such as cost, accessibility, and patient motivation remain and should be addressed to ensure the effective implementation of these integrated strategies in real-world settings.

40867596,Symphony of Digestion: Coordinated Host-Microbiome Enzymatic Interplay in Gut Ecosystem.,"Digestion was once viewed as a host-driven process, dependent on salivary, gastric, pancreatic, and intestinal enzymes to break down macronutrients. However, new insights into the gut microbiota have redefined this view, highlighting digestion as a cooperative effort between host and microbial enzymes. Host enzymes initiate nutrient breakdown, while microbial enzymes, especially in the colon, extend this process by fermenting resistant polysaccharides, modifying bile acids, and transforming phytochemicals and xenobiotics into bioactive compounds. These microbial actions produce metabolites like short-chain fatty acids, which influence gut barrier function, immune regulation, and metabolism. I propose two frameworks to describe this interaction: the ""duet,"" emphasizing sequential enzymatic cooperation, and the ""orchestra,"" reflecting a spatially and temporally coordinated system with host-microbiota feedback. Disruption of this symbiosis, through antibiotics, inflammation, diet, or aging, leads to dysbiosis, impaired digestion, and contributes to metabolic, neurologic, cardiovascular, and inflammatory diseases. Recognizing digestion as a dynamic, integrated system opens new paths for therapies and nutrition. These include enzyme-targeted prebiotics, probiotics, postbiotics, and personalized diets. Embracing this systems-level perspective enables innovative diagnostics and treatments, aiming to restore enzymatic balance and improve digestive and systemic health.",Lushchak VI,Biomolecules,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40867596/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40856522,Whole grains are not equal: the role of fiber structure and phytochemicals in health.,"Precision nutrition seeks to optimize human health by tailoring dietary interventions to individual genetic, metabolic, microbial, and lifestyle profiles. In this context, whole grains (WGs) serve as ideal candidates, as their diverse fiber structures and grain-specific phytochemicals interact dynamically with host physiology and the gut microbiome. This review examines six widely consumed WGs: wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.), rye (<i>Secale cereale</i> L.), oats (<i>Avena sativa</i> L.), barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> L.), brown rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.), and corn (<i>Zea mays</i> L.), focusing on their distinct dietary fiber and bioactive compounds. WGs should not be viewed as uniform fiber sources. The quantity, structural complexity, solubility, viscosity, and fermentability of fibers vary among different WGs, contributing to the distinct health benefits of each grain. Moreover, while these grains offer general nutritional benefits, each grain contains unique secondary metabolites. Key examples include alkylresorcinols (ARs) in wheat and rye, avenanthramides (AVAs) in oats, hordatines in barley, γ-oryzanols (γ-OZs) and tricin in rice, and polyamine-conjugated hydroxycinnamates (PACH) in corn. These grain-specific phytochemicals exert diverse pharmacodynamic effects across metabolic, inflammatory, and oxidative pathways. For instance, hordatines shows effects on cardiovascular and glycemic regulation; ARs, γ-OZs, and tricin support lipid homeostasis and colorectal cancer mitigation; AVAs possess anti-inflammatory and microbiota-modulating properties; and PACH contribute to antioxidant capacity. Such functional specificity positions WGs as strategic components in individualized nutrition frameworks, holding promise for disease prevention and health optimization within the paradigm of precision nutrition.",Hafez-Ghoran S; Taktaz F; Sang S,Food & function,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40856522/,1,0,0,0,0,0

40806058,Histamine Metabolism in IBD: Towards Precision Nutrition.,"Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) exhibit a dysregulated immune response that may be further exacerbated by bioactive compounds, such as histamine. Current dietary guidelines for IBD primarily focus on symptom management and flare-up prevention, yet targeted nutritional strategies addressing histamine metabolism remain largely unexplored. This narrative review aims to summarize the existing literature on the complex interplay between IBD and histamine metabolism and propose a novel dietary framework for managing IBD progression in patients with histamine intolerance (HIT). Relevant studies were identified through a comprehensive literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science. The proposed low-histamine diet (LHD) aims to reduce the overall histamine burden in the body through two primary strategies: (1) minimizing exogenous intake by limiting high-histamine and histamine-releasing foods and (2) reducing endogenous histamine production by modulating gut microbiota composition, specifically targeting histamine-producing bacteria. In parallel, identifying individuals who are histamine-intolerant and understanding the role of histamine-degrading enzymes, such as diamine oxidase (DAO) and histamine-N-methyltransferase (HNMT), are emerging as important areas of focus. Despite growing interest in the role of histamine and mast cell activation in gut inflammation, no clinical trials have investigated the effects of a low-histamine diet in IBD populations. Therefore, future research should prioritize the implementation of LHD interventions in IBD patients to evaluate their generalizability and clinical applicability.",Kanta D; Katsamakas E; Gudiksen AMB; Jalili M,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40806058/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40806051,Restoring a Healthy Relationship with Food by Decoupling Stress and Eating: A Translational Review of Nutrition and Mental Health.,"Psychological stress and dietary behavior are interdependent forces that greatly influence mental and physical health. Thus, both what and how we eat impact our well-being. Maladaptive eating patterns, such as eating in response to emotional cues rather than physiological hunger, have become increasingly common amid modern stressors and an ultra-processed food environment. This narrative review synthesizes interdisciplinary findings from nutritional psychiatry, microbiome science, and behavioral nutrition to explore how stress physiology, gut-brain interactions, and dietary quality shape emotional regulation and eating behavior. It highlights mechanisms (e.g., HPA-axis dysregulation, blunted interoception, and inflammatory and epigenetic pathways) and examines the evidence for mindful and intuitive eating; phytochemical-rich, whole-food dietary patterns; and the emerging role of precision nutrition. Trauma-informed approaches, cultural foodways, structural barriers to healthy eating, and clinical implementation strategies (e.g., interprofessional collaboration) are considered in the context of public health equity to support sustainable mental wellness through dietary interventions. Ultimately, restoring a healthy relationship with food positions nutrition not only as sustenance but as a modifiable regulator of affect, cognition, and stress resilience, central to mental and physical well-being.",Warren A; Frame LA,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40806051/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40737867,Precision nutrition for obesity management: A gut microbiota-centered weight-loss approach.,"Obesity is a complex and multifactorial condition strongly associated with metabolic burdens and cardiovascular diseases. This review focuses on precision nutrition as a strategy for obesity management, exploring how personalized interventions can modulate the composition and functionality of the gut microbiome to promote weight loss and improve metabolic health. A growing body of evidence suggests that imbalances in gut microbiota composition directly impact lipid metabolism, immune and inflammatory pathways, and appetite regulation mechanisms. Furthermore, the review discusses the relationship between gut microbiota and dietary factors, highlighting how certain types of diets (such as the Mediterranean diet and fiber-rich diets) can promote the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and the growth of beneficial bacteria associated with weight regulation and reduced inflammation. While diet is the primary factor modulating the gut microbiota, factors such as genetics and epigenetic characteristics, body composition, maternal nutritional, type of birth delivery, physical activity and even drug use also play significant roles in this modulation. Although the use of precision nutrition approaches still faces challenges, such as cost and variability in individual response, the integration of omics technologies, artificial intelligence, and machine learning appear to offer great potential as tools to identify specific microbial and genetic profiles that allow for the personalization of nutritional interventions. These technologies enable large-scale analysis of dietary, genomic, and microbial factors to create dietary strategies to prevent or treat obesity that meet the specific metabolic needs of each individual. Thus, the application of these tools in clinical settings could transform obesity management, creating data-driven interventions that enhance treatment effectiveness.",Carvalho LM; da Mota JCNL; Ribeiro AA; Carvalho BG; Martinez JA; Nicoletti CF,"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40737867/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40732941,Gut Microbiota in Women with Eating Disorders: A New Frontier in Pathophysiology and Treatment.,"Emerging evidence highlights the critical role of the gut microbiota in the development and progression of eating disorders (EDs), particularly in women, who are more frequently affected by these conditions. Women with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder exhibit distinct alterations in gut microbiota composition compared to healthy controls. These alterations, collectively termed dysbiosis, involve reduced microbial diversity and shifts in key bacterial populations responsible for regulating metabolism, inflammation, and gut-brain signaling. The gut microbiota is known to influence appetite regulation, mood, and stress responses-factors closely implicated in the pathogenesis of EDs. In women, hormonal fluctuations related to menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause may further modulate gut microbial profiles, potentially compounding vulnerabilities to disordered eating. Moreover, the restrictive eating patterns, purging behaviors, and altered dietary intake often observed in women with EDs exacerbate microbial imbalances, contributing to intestinal permeability, low-grade inflammation, and disturbances in neurotransmitter production. This evolving understanding suggests that microbiota-targeted therapies, such as probiotics, prebiotics, dietary modulation, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), could complement conventional psychological and pharmacological treatments in women with EDs. Furthermore, precision nutrition and personalized microbiome-based interventions tailored to an individual's microbial and metabolic profile offer promising avenues for improving treatment efficacy, even though these approaches remain exploratory and their clinical applicability has yet to be fully validated. Future research should focus on sex-specific microbial signatures, causal mechanisms, and microbiota-based interventions to enhance personalized treatment for women struggling with eating disorders.",Marano G; Rossi S; Sfratta G; Acanfora M; Anesini MB; Traversi G; Lisci FM; Rinaldi L; Pola R; Gasbarrini A; Sani G; Gaetani E; Mazza M,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40732941/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40724948,"A Systems Biology Approach to Memory Health: Integrating Network Pharmacology, Gut Microbiota, and Multi-Omics for Health Functional Foods.","Memory impairment, ranging from mild memory impairment to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, poses an escalating global health challenge that necessitates multi-targeted interventions to prevent progression. Health functional foods (HFFs), which include bioactive dietary compounds that not only provide basic nutrition but also function beyond that to modulate physiological pathways, offer a promising non-pharmacological strategy to preserve memory function. This review presents an integrative framework for the discovery, evaluation, and clinical translation of biomarkers responsive to HFFs in the context of preventing memory impairment. We examine both established clinical biomarkers, such as amyloid-β and tau in the cerebrospinal fluid, neuroimaging indicators, and memory assessments, as well as emerging nutritionally sensitive markers including cytokines, microRNAs, gut microbiota signatures, epigenetic modifications, and neuroactive metabolites. By leveraging systems biology approaches, we explore how network pharmacology, gut-brain axis modulation, and multi-omics integration can help to elucidate the complex interactions between HFF components and memory-related pathways such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, synaptic plasticity, and metabolic regulation. The review also addresses the translational pipeline for HFFs, from formulation and standardization to regulatory frameworks and clinical development, with an emphasis on precision nutrition strategies and cross-disciplinary integration. Ultimately, we propose a paradigm shift in memory health interventions, positioning HFFs as scientifically validated compounds for personalized nutrition within a preventative memory function framework.",Yuan H; Zhou J; Li H; Kang S; Park S,International journal of molecular sciences,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40724948/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40700711,Interactional Effects of Food Macronutrients with Gut Microbiome: Implications for Host Health and Risk.,"Macronutrients in the diet (e.g., carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids) that are rarely absorbed in the small intestine can typically traverse to the colon where they are metabolized by the gut microbiota to produce a spectrum of beneficial or detrimental metabolites. These gut-microbiota-dependent small-molecule metabolites are subsequently absorbed by the intestinal mucosa to participate in various physiological responses. Notably, succinate as a star dicarboxylic acid metabolite stemming from microbial fermentation of nondigestible carbohydrates regulates blood glucose homeostasis by promoting intestinal gluconeogenesis while inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, protein- or tryptophan-derived indole metabolites have emerged as a promising target for modulating neuropathic diseases. Fascinatingly, the linkage between gut microbiota and lncRNA <i>Snhg9</i> introduces a novel promising dimension for modulating lipid absorption, metabolism, and storage. Ongoing advancements in elucidating the interplay between macronutrients, gut microbiota, and host health may facilitate the development of gut microbiota-directed clinical precision nutrition strategies through intake of tailored macronutrients.",Tan Z; Yang C; Zhao Y; Yang X; Li T,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40700711/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40637175,Gut microbiome-based interventions for the management of obesity in children and adolescents aged up to 19 years.,"The epidemic of overweight and obesity affects more than 390 million children and adolescents aged 5 to 19 years and 37 million children under five years of age. Overweight and obesity are associated with both short- and long-term consequences, including chronic inflammation, metabolic diseases, as well as alterations in the gut microbiome composition. Gut microbiome-based approaches may impact microbiome-related metrics such as diversity or the abundance of intestinal bacteria, which may be linked to obesity-related outcomes. However, evidence regarding the effect of gut microbiome-based interventions for the management of obesity is limited. To assess the effects of gut microbiome-based interventions in the management of overweight or obesity in children and adolescents in all their diversity aged 0 to 19 years. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science Core Collection, BIOSIS Previews, Global Index Medicus (all regions), IBECS, SciELO, PAHO, PAHO IRIS, WHO IRIS, WHOLIS, Bibliomap, TRoPHI as well as ICTRP Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. The date of the last search for all databases was 24 January 2025. We did not apply any language restrictions. We included randomised controlled trials that evaluated gut microbiome-based interventions [i.e. prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)] compared to standard-of-care, placebo, or control interventions in children and adolescents aged 0 to 19 years with overweight or obesity. Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and full texts, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool and certainty of the evidence using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE), a framework for assessing the certainty of evidence and making recommendations in systematic reviews. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed unless only one study per outcome was available, for which fixed-effect analyses were performed. We found 17 studies (838 participants) from various countries, evaluating the effects of prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, SCFAs, and FMT on body mass index (BMI), body weight, waist circumference, total body fat percentage (%TBF), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and adverse events. Of the 17 studies included, five studies were in adolescents aged 10 to 19 years, and 12 studies were in children and adolescents spanning both age groups, 0 to 19 years. Upon contacting authors for data grouped by age of the participants, no studies provided separate outcomes data for children and adolescents. The included studies were funded by either academic funding sources or grants from the public and private sectors. Additionally, 15 studies were classified as currently being conducted ('ongoing'). The certainty of evidence throughout was very low. In adolescents 10 to 19 years of age, probiotics compared to placebo or no intervention may have little to no effect on BMI, body weight, waist circumference, %TBF, blood pressure, and adverse events. Similarly, FMT compared to placebo may have little to no effect on waist circumference, %TBF, blood pressure, and adverse events in this age group. According to one study with 41 participants and in children and adolescents 0 to 19 years of age, intervention with prebiotics compared to placebo may result in a small reduction in BMI (mean difference = -0.70, 95% CI = -1.25 to -0.15) and body weight (mean difference = -1.5, 95% CI = -2.61 to -0.39). Prebiotics compared to placebo may have little to no effect on waist circumference, %TBF, systolic blood pressure, and adverse events. No data were available on the effect of prebiotics on diastolic blood pressure. Probiotics compared to placebo may have little to no effect on BMI, body weight, waist circumference, %TBF, blood pressure, and adverse events in children and adolescents (0 to 19 years). Synbiotics compared to placebo may result in a reduction in systolic blood pressure (mean difference = -40.00, 95% CI = -50.63 to -29.37) in children and adolescents (0 to 19 years); according to one study with 56 participants. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of synbiotics compared to a placebo on BMI, body weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, and adverse events. No data were available on the effect of synbiotics compared to placebo on %TBF. Synbiotics, compared to probiotics, may have little to no effect on waist circumference, %TBF, and adverse events. No data were available on the effect of synbiotics compared to probiotics on BMI, body weight, and blood pressure. According to one study with 48 participants and very low-certainty of evidence, SCFAs compared to placebo may result in a reduction in waist circumference (mean difference = -5.08, 95% CI = -7.40 to -2.76) and BMI (mean difference = -2.26, 95% CI = -3.24 to -1.28) in children and adolescents (0-19 years). SCFAs compared to placebo may have little to no effect on adverse events. No data were available on the effect of SCFAs on body weight, %TBF, and blood pressure. Adverse events, i.e. abdominal cramps, abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, and migraine, were reported in the prebiotics group but with very low incidence. Additionally, adverse events such as nausea and headache were reported in the SCFAs group, but with low incidence. In adolescents aged 10 to 19 years, gut microbiome-based interventions may result in little to no difference in obesity-related outcomes. In children and adolescents aged 0 to 19 years, prebiotics may result in a small reduction in BMI and body weight; synbiotics may result in a reduction in systolic blood pressure, and SCFAs may result in a reduction in BMI and waist circumference, albeit the certainty of evidence was very low. The evidence was of very low certainty due to few studies per comparison, small sample sizes, short intervention durations, and insufficient reporting of adverse events. More rigorous research examining different types of gut microbiome-based interventions for the management of obesity is required in children and adolescents, both in clinical and community settings. Future trials should also report methods related to randomisation, blinding, and compliance, as well as include prespecified analysis plans.",Fahim SM; Huey SL; Palma Molina XE; Agarwal N; Ridwan P; Ji N; Kibbee M; Kuriyan R; Finkelstein JL; Mehta S,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40637175/,0,1,0,0,0,0
40625617,The human gut microbiota is associated with host lifestyle: a comprehensive narrative review.,"The gut microbiota serves as a critical interface between lifestyle factors and host physiology. Despite extensive research on individual domains including diet, sleep, and exercise, an integrated understanding of their synergistic effects on microbial communities remains incomplete. This knowledge gap limits our ability to develop targeted microbiome-based interventions for metabolic and immune-related disorders. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of peer-reviewed literature from 2000 to present, identified through systematic searches of PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus using key terms related to gut microbiota and lifestyle interventions. Our analysis focused on studies incorporating microbiome profiling techniques, controlled lifestyle interventions, and multi-omics data integration. The review prioritized mechanistic insights from both clinical and preclinical investigations while critically assessing methodological approaches across the field. High-fiber dietary patterns consistently promoted the abundance of beneficial, short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria, though with notable inter-individual variation. Circadian rhythm disruption was associated with reduced microbial diversity and expansion of pro-inflammatory bacterial taxa, paralleling increases in systemic inflammation markers. Athletic populations demonstrated unique microbial signatures characterized by enhanced metabolic potential, with distinct taxonomic profiles emerging across different sport disciplines. This work synthesizes current evidence into a novel framework for understanding lifestyle-microbiota interactions, while identifying key challenges in study design and data interpretation. We propose standardized methodological approaches for future investigations and outline translational strategies for personalized microbiota modulation. These insights advance the potential for targeted microbial interventions to optimize metabolic and immune health outcomes.",Zeng Q; Feng X; Hu Y; Su S,Frontiers in microbiology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40625617/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The ICB efficacy is proved to be associated with gut microbiota. However, the research on improving ICB outcomes of CRC by microbes or their metabolites is obstructed compared to other types of cancers. Through summarizing the main progress and limitations in previous work, we provide our proposal for further study on CRC. For preclinical basic investigation, microbial tryptophan metabolism regulates ICB therapy outcomes particularly in CRC and requires specific focus. For clinical trials, sources of recruited cohorts and donators of fecal microbiota transplantation can be diversified. For future application, interdisciplinary methods and models coupled with advanced technologies are suggested for designing precise intervention strategies based on prebiotics.",Lu Y; Zhang Z; Chen L; Xue P; Zhang Y; Li Y; Guo H,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40617323/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40600905,Contribution of dietary methionine to gut health and its related diseases: implications for precision nutrition.,"Gut health is intricately linked to energy homeostasis, stress resistance, inflammation, and longevity. Methionine (Met) intake significantly influences gut health, with both supplementation and restriction showing distinct effects. While appropriate Met supplementation offers benefits, excessive intake can be harmful, whereas Met restriction appears to improve overall health of the body, especially the gut. This review synthesizes research on Met's role in gut health, highlighting its metabolism, interactions with the intestinal microbiota, and effects on oxidative stress, inflammation, and permeability in the intestine. The possible reason for Met intake influences the risk of metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive impairment, thus influencing lifespan was explored, which is potentially via gut health. In addition, strategies for achieving precision nutrition of Met, including dietary adjustments, production of Met-specific foods, bioengineering plant strains, and methioninase supplementation, were proposed. These insights aim to deepen the understanding of Met's effects on gut health and guide interventions for improving health outcomes.",Yang Y; Xie Y; Lu M; Xu Y; Zhao R,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40600905/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We systematically evaluate how diet modulates chronic low-grade inflammation through several physiological processes. Furthermore, we suggest three intervention strategies tailored to specific stages of disease: (i) promoting anti-inflammatory dietary patterns in the general population, (ii) implementing precision nutrition targeting inflammatory biomarkers in individuals at risk, and (iii) utilizing adjuvant dietary therapies for existing inflammation. Overall, we argue that early nutritional interventions could address the unmet clinical need to alter inflammatory trajectories before clinical manifestation.",Wang Z; Yuan C; Huang T; Lu B,Trends in endocrinology and metabolism: TEM,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40581554/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40565936,Nutrition and Diet Patterns as Key Modulators of Metabolic Reprogramming in Melanoma Immunotherapy.,"<b>Background</b>: Melanoma, one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer, has seen significant therapeutic advances with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). However, many patients fail to respond or develop resistance, creating the need for adjunct strategies. <b>Objective</b>: The objective of this study is to critically evaluate how specific dietary patterns and nutrient-derived metabolites modulate melanoma metabolism and immunotherapy outcomes, emphasizing translational implications. <b>Methods</b>: We performed an integrative review of preclinical and clinical studies investigating dietary interventions in melanoma models and ICI-treated patients. Mechanistic insights were extracted from studies on nutrient transport, immunometabolism, and microbiome-immune interactions, including data from ongoing nutritional clinical trials. <b>Results</b>: Diets rich in fermentable fibers, plant polyphenols, and unsaturated lipids, such as Mediterranean and ketogenic diets, seem to contribute to the reprogramming of tumor metabolism and enhance CD8+ T-cell activity. Fasting-mimicking and methionine-restricted diets modulate T-cell fitness and tumor vulnerability via nutrient stress sensors (e.g., UPR, mTOR). High fiber intake correlates with favorable gut microbiota and improved ICI efficacy, while excess protein, methionine, or refined carbohydrates impair immune surveillance via lactate accumulation and immunosuppressive myeloid recruitment. Several dietary molecules act as network-level modulators of host and microbial proteins, with parallels to known drug scaffolds. <b>Conclusions</b>: Integrating dietary interventions into melanoma immunotherapy can significantly influence metabolic reprogramming by targeting metabolic vulnerabilities and reshaping the tumor-immune-microbiome axis. When combined with AI-driven nutrient-protein interaction mapping, this approach offers a precision nutrition paradigm that supports both physicians and patients, emerging as a novel layer to enhance and consolidate existing therapeutic strategies.",Grafanaki K; Maniatis A; Anastogianni A; Bania A; Pasmatzi E; Stathopoulos C,Journal of clinical medicine,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40565936/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Dietary antioxidants from plant sources, such as polyphenols, flavonoids, carotenoids, and phenolic acids, have been increasingly studied for their potential to modulate these pathophysiological mechanisms. This review aims to summarize and critically analyze the current evidence on the biological effects, therapeutic potential, and translational challenges of plant-derived antioxidants in the prevention and management of T2DM. This narrative review was conducted using peer-reviewed literature from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Emphasis was placed on mechanistic studies, clinical trials, bioavailability data, and advances in formulation technologies related to antioxidant compounds in the context of T2DM. Plant antioxidants exert beneficial effects by modulating oxidative stress, reducing systemic inflammation, and improving insulin signaling pathways. However, their clinical application is limited by low bioavailability, chemical instability, and high interindividual variability. Recent developments, such as nanoencapsulation, synergistic functional food formulations, and microbiome-targeted strategies, have shown promise in enhancing efficacy. Additionally, personalized nutrition approaches and regulatory advances are emerging to support the integration of antioxidant-based interventions into diabetes care. Plant-derived antioxidants represent a promising complementary tool for T2DM management. Nonetheless, their effective clinical use depends on overcoming pharmacokinetic limitations and validating their long-term efficacy in well-designed trials. Integrating food technology, microbiome science, and precision nutrition will be crucial to translate these compounds into safe, scalable, and personalized therapeutic options for individuals with or at risk of T2DM.",Clemente-Suárez VJ; Martín-Rodríguez A; Beltrán-Velasco AI; Rubio-Zarapuz A; Martínez-Guardado I; Valcárcel-Martín R; Tornero-Aguilera JF,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40563357/,1,0,0,0,0,0

This review synthesizes mechanistic insights demonstrating how live starter cultures and their fermentation-derived metabolites (short-chain fatty acids, bioactive peptides, and exopolysaccharides) act synergistically to enhance microbial diversity, reinforce epithelial barrier integrity via upregulation of tight-junction proteins, and modulate immune signaling. Clinical evidence supports significant improvements in metabolic parameters (fasting glucose, lipid profiles, blood pressure) and reductions in systemic inflammation across metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and IBS cohorts. We highlight critical modulatory factors-including strain specificity, host enterotypes and FUT2 genotype, fermentation parameters, and matrix composition-that govern probiotic engraftment, postbiotic yield, and therapeutic efficacy. Despite promising short-term outcomes, current studies are limited by heterogeneous designs and brief intervention periods, underscoring the need for long-term, adaptive trials and integrative multi-omics to establish durability and causality.

This dual recognition maintains the delicate balance between immune tolerance and activation, thereby influencing health and disease outcomes. Therefore, we explored the structural and functional evolution of bacterial flagellin to elucidate its role in innate and adaptive immune responses, along with its impact on metabolic processes, particularly via TLR5. In this review, we highlight the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of flagellin, including its application in vaccine development, cancer immunotherapy, and microbiome-based therapies. We integrated perspectives from structural biology, immunology, and microbiome research to elucidate the co-evolutionary dynamics between gut microbiota-derived flagellin and host immunity.

40440482,Guild-Level Response of the Gut Microbiome to Nutritional Signals: Advancing Precision Nutrition for Metabolic Health.,"The gut microbiome functions as a hidden organ, providing essential ecosystem services to sustain human health. By identifying stably connected bacteria, we reveal two competing guilds (TCG) as the resilient core of the microbiome: the health-promoting foundation guild (FG) and the proinflammatory pathobiont guild (PG). FG members produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), enhancing gut barrier integrity and systemic resilience, while PG members disrupt metabolism through endotoxins, indoles, and hydrogen sulfide. Together, the FG and PG mediate ∼85% of ecological interactions in a dynamic, seesaw-like relationship. As evolved nutrient sensors for coping with feast-famine cycles, these guilds align host metabolism with dietary patterns. Fiber-rich diets bolster FG activity, maintaining microbial balance and metabolic health, whereas fiber-deficient diets in modern-day society favor chronic PG dominance, driving inflammation and disease. Synthesizing clinical and experimental evidence, this review positions the TCG model as a transformative framework for precision nutrition, guiding strategies to restore microbial balance and address metabolic disorders.",Zhao L,Annual review of nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40440482/,1,0,0,0,0,0

This review explores the complex relationships among nutrition, gut microbiota, immune regulation, allergic diseases, and multimorbidity. It highlights how targeted nutritional and microbial interventions may influence disease outcomes. Dietary components and microbial metabolites dynamically modulated immune function, highlighting the critical role of the gut-immune-metabolism axis in disease pathogenesis and management. Personalized nutrition, guided by advances in diagnostics such as component-resolved diagnostics, basophil activation tests, and epigenetic biomarkers, allows for precise dietary interventions tailored to individual allergy phenotypes and multimorbidity profiles. The Mediterranean diet, breastfeeding, and microbiota-targeted therapies have emerged as effective strategies to enhance immune resilience, reduce inflammation, and manage allergic reactions. Technological advancements, including artificial intelligence-driven dietary assessments, wearable devices, and mobile applications, have further revolutionized personalized dietary management, enabling real-time, precise nutritional monitoring and intervention. Despite these advances, challenges in implementing personalized nutrition persist, including variability in dietary patterns, cultural and socioeconomic factors, and accessibility concerns. Future research should focus on long-term interventional and longitudinal studies to validate precision nutrition strategies and enhance clinical applicability.

40368200,The role of modification in the physicochemical properties and gut microecological regulatory functions of non-digestible polysaccharides: A review.,"Non-digestible polysaccharides (NDPs) are a type of polysaccharides that are difficult for human digestive enzymes to degrade. They typically reach the large intestine as food residues and exert prebiotic effects by interacting with intestinal microorganisms. However, they were limited in practical application value due to their complex structure and poor water solubility. Hence, the alteration of the physicochemical properties of NDPs is of great significance for enhancing their functional performance. The existing literature on the modification of NDPs primarily focuses on chemical methods to modify their physicochemical properties. Meanwhile, we also found that they focus on the modification methods themselves, lacking a systematic summary and analysis of the regulation of intestinal microecological functions by modified NDPs. The correlation between the physicochemical properties of modified NDPs and the regulatory mechanisms of gut microbiota needs to be systematically summarized. Therefore, this paper aims to systematically review the modification methods of NDPs from the perspectives of physics, chemistry and biology, with a focus on the molecular mechanisms and optimization strategies of these modification methods, such as the combined use of various modification methods, the regulatory mechanisms of the modified NDPs on the microbiota, as well as their potential applications in functional foods and pharmaceutical carriers. This paper could provide a theoretical basis for the selective modification and targeted regulation of intestinal microecology by NDPs and the development of new functional NDPs products, which is of great significance for promoting the innovative application of NDPs in precision nutrition and adjunctive disease therapy.",Jiang J; Zheng T; Zheng H; Wu Y; Jia F; Xu Y; He K; Yang Y,International journal of biological macromolecules,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40368200/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Dietary interventions targeting gut microbiota have shown potential in modulating microbial composition and mitigating MASLD progression. In this context, the integration of multi-omics analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) in personalized nutrition offers new opportunities for tailoring dietary strategies based on individual microbiome profiles and metabolic responses. The use of chatbots and other AI-based health solutions offers a unique opportunity to democratize access to health interventions due to their low cost, accessibility, and scalability. Future research should focus on the clinical validation of AI-powered dietary strategies, integrating microbiome-based therapies and precision nutrition approaches. Establishing standardized protocols and ethical guidelines will be crucial for implementing AI in MASLD management, paving the way for a more personalized, data-driven approach to disease prevention and treatment.",Jiménez-González C; Alonso-Peña M; Argos Vélez P; Crespo J; Iruzubieta P,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40362889/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40345659,From traditional to artificial intelligence-driven approaches: Revolutionizing personalized and precision nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, is a chronic inflammatory condition with global prevalence and varying incidence. The IBD pathogenesis involves intricate interactions among genetic, host and environmental factors, leading to dysregulated immune responses and chronic intestinal inflammation. Alongside elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and altered miRNAs expression, more studies highlight significant dysbiosis in both fecal and ileal microbiota of IBD patients. This dysbiosis is characterized by an increase in pro-inflammatory and mucin-degrading bacteria (e.g., Fusobacterium spp., Escherichia spp.) and a decline in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) -producing microbes (e.g., Roseburia spp., Faecalibacterium spp.) which play a protective role in gut health. Diet emerges as a key environmental factor influencing IBD onset and progression and recent advancements in""omics"" technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, provide a deeper understanding of the molecular interactions between genes, gut microbiota (GM) and nutrition. Finally, new technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), further enhance findings by enabling data integration and personalized dietary strategies. In this scenario, this review aims to summarize accumulating data on the effects of dietary interventions in IBD patients and introduce the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in facilitating precision dietary approaches to improve IBD management.",Baldi S; Sarikaya D; Lotti S; Cuffaro F; Fink D; Colombini B; Sofi F; Amedei A,Clinical nutrition ESPEN,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40345659/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40313608,Precision Dietary Intervention: Gut Microbiome and Meta-metabolome as Functional Readouts.,"Gut microbiome, the group of commensals residing within the intestinal tract, is closely associated with dietary patterns by interacting with food components. The gut microbiome is modifiable by the diet, and in turn, it utilizes the undigested food components as substrates and generates a group of small molecule-metabolites that addressed as ""meta-metabolome"" in this review. Profiling and mapping of meta-metabolome could yield insightful information at higher resolution and serve as functional readouts for precision nutrition and formation of personalized dietary strategies. For assessing the meta-metabolome, sample preparation is important, and it should aim for retrieval of gut microbial metabolites as intact as possible. The meta-metabolome can be investigated via untargeted and targeted meta-metabolomics with analytical platforms such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Employing flux analysis with meta-metabolomics using available database could further elucidate metabolic pathways that lead to biomarker discovery. In conclusion, integration of gut microbiome and meta-metabolomics is a promising supplementary approach to tailor precision dietary intervention. In this review, relationships among diet, gut microbiome, and meta-metabolome are elucidated, with an emphasis on recent advances in alternative analysis techniques proposed for nutritional research. We hope that this review will provide information for establishing pipelines complementary to traditional approaches for achieving precision dietary intervention.",Luo J; Wang Y,"Phenomics (Cham, Switzerland)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40313608/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40291991,Impacts of non-nutritive sweeteners on the human microbiome.,"Replacing sugar with non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) is a common dietary strategy for reducing the caloric content and glycemic index of foods and beverages. However, the efficacy of this strategy in preventing and managing metabolic syndrome and its associated comorbidities remains uncertain. Human cohort studies suggest that NNS contribute to, rather than prevent, metabolic syndrome, whereas randomized controlled trials yield heterogeneous outcomes, ranging from beneficial to detrimental impacts on cardiometabolic health. The World Health Organization recently issued a conditional recommendation against using NNS, citing the need for additional evidence causally linking sweeteners to health effects. One proposed mechanism through which NNS induce metabolic derangements is through disruption of the gut microbiome, a link strongly supported by evidence in preclinical models. This review summarizes the evidence for similar effects in interventional and observational trials in humans. The limited available data highlight heterogeneity between trials, as some, but not all, find NNS consumption associated with microbiome modulation as well as metabolic effects independent of sweetener type. In other trials, the lack of microbiome changes coincides with the absence of metabolic effects. We discuss the hypothesis that the impacts of NNS on health are personalized and microbiome dependent. Thus, a precision nutrition approach may help resolve the conflicting reports regarding NNS impacts on the microbiome and health. This review also discusses additional factors contributing to study heterogeneity that should be addressed in future clinical trials to clarify the relationship between NNS, the microbiome, and health to better inform dietary guidelines and public health policies.",Crakes KR; Questell L; Soni S; Suez J,"Immunometabolism (Cobham, Surrey)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40291991/,1,0,0,0,0,0

EMFs modulate neurotransmitter systems, including serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA), alleviating depressive symptoms. Extracts from EMFs, such as Ganoderma lucidum, Hericium erinaceus, Poria cocos, and Cordyceps militaris, demonstrate significant antidepressant-like effects in preclinical studies. Their bioactive compounds influence the tryptophan-kynurenine (KYN) pathway, regulate the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and reduce neuroinflammation, all of which are linked to stress response and mood regulation. The review also explores the gut-brain axis, highlighting how EMF-derived polysaccharides improve gut health by modulating microbiota, potentially mitigating depressive symptoms. Additionally, it discusses the use of EMFs in functional foods and dietary supplements, innovations like 3D food printing for depression-related issues, and synthetic biology for enhancing compound production. Artificial intelligence is used to model complex mechanisms. However, challenges remain, such as standardization and lack of clinical validation. Future research should address these gaps, emphasizing personalized interventions and advanced technologies for next-generation antidepressant foods.",Gong P; Wang J; Long H; Yang W; Chen X; Li N; Chen F; Zhang J; Guo Y,Molecular nutrition & food research,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40289452/,0,1,0,0,0,0
40280478,Fatty acid metabolism: The crossroads in intestinal homeostasis and tumor.,"Fatty acids (FAs) have various functions on cell regulation considering their abundant types and metabolic pathways. In addition, the relation between FA and other nutritional metabolism makes their functions more complex. As the first place for diet-derived FA metabolism, intestine is significantly influenced despite lack of clear conclusions due to the inconsistent findings. In this review, we discuss the regulation of fatty acid metabolism on the fate of intestinal stem cells in homeostasis and disorders, and also focus on the intestinal tumor development and treatment from the aspect of gut microbiota-epithelium-immune interaction. We summarize that the balances between FA oxidation and glycolysis, between oxidative phosphorylation and ketogenesis, between catabolism and anabolism, and the specific roles of individual FA types determine the diverse effects of intestinal FA metabolism in different cases. We hope this will inspire further dissection and suggest precise dietary/metabolic intervention for different demands related to intestinal health.",Lu Y; Chen L; Lin Y; Zhang Y; Wang Y; Yu W; Ren F; Guo H,Metabolism: clinical and experimental,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40280478/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Recent data have highlighted the bioactive metabolites involved in the etiology and prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases such as obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and atherosclerosis. Numerous studies reveal that endogenous metabolites biosynthesized by host organisms or gut microflora regulate metabolic responses and disorders. Lipids, amino acids, and bile acids, as endogenous metabolic modulators, regulate energy metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and immune response through multiple pathways, such as insulin signaling cascade, chemical modifications, and metabolite-macromolecule interactions. Furthermore, the gut microbial metabolites short-chain fatty acids, as signaling regulators have a variety of beneficial impacts in regulating energy metabolic homeostasis. In this review, we will summarize information about the roles of bioactive metabolites in the pathogenesis of many metabolic diseases. Furthermore, we discuss the potential value of metabolites in the promising preventive and therapeutic perspectives of human metabolic diseases.",Xiao M; Zhou N; Tian Z; Sun C,The Journal of nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40250565/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40233201,Targeting the Gut Microbiota's Role in Host Energy Absorption With Precision Nutrition Interventions for the Prevention and Treatment of Obesity.,"The field of precision nutrition aims to develop dietary approaches based on individual biological factors such as genomics or the gut microbiota. The gut microbiota, which is the highly individualized and complex community of microbes residing in the colon, is a key contributor to human physiology. Although gut microbes play multiple roles in the metabolism of nutrients, their role in modulating the absorption of dietary energy from foods that escape digestion in the small intestine has the potential to variably affect energy balance and, thus, body weight. The fate of this energy, and its subsequent impact on body weight, is well described in rodents and is emerging in humans. This narrative review is focused on recent clinical evidence of the role of the gut microbiota in human energy balance, specifically its impact on energy available to the human host. Despite recent progress, remaining gaps in knowledge present opportunities for developing and implementing strategies to understand causal microbial mechanisms related to energy balance. We propose that implementing rigorous microbiota-focused measurements in the context of innovative clinical trial designs will elucidate integrated diet-host-gut microbiota mechanisms. These mechanisms are primed to be targets for precision nutrition interventions to optimize energy balance to achieve desired weight outcomes. Given the magnitude and impact of the obesity epidemic, implementing these interventions within comprehensive weight management paradigms has the potential to be of public health significance.",Corbin KD; Igudesman D; Smith SR; Zengler K; Krajmalnik-Brown R,Nutrition reviews,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40233201/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40228747,Nutritional strategies in oncology: The role of dietary patterns in modulating tumor progression and treatment response.,"Dietary interventions can influence tumor growth by restricting tumor-specific nutritional requirements, altering the nutrient availability in the tumor microenvironment, or enhancing the cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs. Metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells, as a significant hallmark of tumor progression, has a profound impact on immune regulation, severely hindering tumor eradication. Dietary interventions can modify tumor metabolic processes to some extent, thereby further improving the efficacy of tumor treatment. In this review, we emphasize the impact of dietary patterns on tumor progression. By exploring the metabolic differences of nutrients in normal cells versus cancer cells, we further clarify how dietary patterns influence cancer treatment. We also discuss the effects of dietary patterns on traditional treatments such as immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and the gut microbiome, thereby underscoring the importance of precision nutrition.",Wang X; Wang Z; Liu Z; Huang F; Pan Z; Zhang Z; Liu T,Biochimica et biophysica acta.

However, it is often overlooked that the adverse effects of these dietary changes can be transmitted from the mother to offspring during early developmental stages, subsequently influencing the predisposition to various diseases later in life. This review aims to delineate the detrimental effects of maternal urban-lifestyle diet (urbanized diet) on early-life health and gut microbiota assembly, provide mechanistic insights on how urbanized diet mediates mother-to-offspring transfer of bioactive substances in both intrauterine and extrauterine and thus affects fetal and neonatal development. Moreover, we also further propose a framework for developing microbiome-targeted precision nutrition and diet strategies specifically for pregnant and lactating women. The establishment of such knowledge can help develop proactive preventive measures from the beginning of life, ultimately reducing the long-term risk of disease and improving public health outcomes.",Huang R; Zhou G; Cai J; Cao C; Zhu Z; Wu Q; Zhang F; Ding Y,Gut microbes,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40176259/,1,0,0,0,0,0

These methods address gastrointestinal symptoms, weight management, and cardiometabolic markers, especially when incorporating data on gut microbiota. Despite its promise, challenges like data privacy, bias, and ethical concerns remain. AI must complement healthcare professionals, necessitating clear guidelines, robust governance, and ongoing research to ensure safe and effective applications. The integration of AI into PN enables highly personalized dietary recommendations by accounting for metabolic variability, genetics, and microbiome data.

40051622,"Microbiota-derived extracellular vesicles: current knowledge, gaps, and challenges in precision nutrition.","The gut microbiota has co-evolved with its host, profoundly shaping the development and functioning of the immune system. This co-evolution has led to a dynamic relationship where microbial metabolites and molecular signals influence immune maturation, tolerance, and defense mechanisms, highlighting its essential role in maintaining host health. Recently, bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs), membrane nanoparticles produced by bacteria, have emerged as important players in gut balance and as potent immune modulators. These vesicles reflect the characteristics of the bacterial membrane and contain nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and metabolites. They can regulate immune processes and are involved in neurological and metabolic diseases due to their ability to distribute both locally in the gut and systemically, affecting immune responses at both levels. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the characteristics and functional profile of BEVs, detailing how nutrition influences the production and function of these vesicles, how antibiotics can disrupt or alter their composition, and how these factors collectively impact immunity and disease development. It also highlights the potential of BEVs in the development of precision nutritional strategies through dietary modulation, such as incorporating prebiotic fibers to enhance beneficial BEV production, reducing intake of processed foods that may promote harmful BEVs, and tailoring probiotic interventions to influence specific microbial communities and their vesicular outputs.",Marquez-Paradas E; Torrecillas-Lopez M; Barrera-Chamorro L; Del Rio-Vazquez JL; Gonzalez-de la Rosa T; Montserrat-de la Paz S,Frontiers in immunology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40051622/,1,0,0,0,0,0

This process substantially impacts immune function, neurodevelopment, and overall health. The noninvasive nature of breast milk collection makes it an ethical and accessible area for research, positioning it as a key focus for future studies. These future directions include the identification of novel bacteria combination, the establishment of comprehensive databases on infant microbiota, and the use of computational models to predict interactions between breast milk components and the gut microbiome.

39922085,Disentangling the nutrition-microbiota liaison in inflammatory bowel disease.,"Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a set of chronic intestinal inflammatory disorders affecting the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Beside compromised intestinal barrier function and immune hyperactivation, a common IBD feature is dysbiosis, characterized by a reduction of some strains of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and an increase in Proteobacteria and pathobionts. Emerging evidence points to diet and nutrition-dependent gut microbiota (GM) modulation, as etiopathogenetic factors and adjuvant therapies in IBD. Currently, no nutritional regimen shows universal efficacy, and advice are controversial, especially those involving restrictive diets potentially resulting in malnutrition. This review provides an overview of the role of macronutrients, dietary protocols and GM modulation in IBD patients. A Western-like diet contributes to an aberrant mucosal immune response to commensal bacteria and impairment of the intestinal barrier integrity, thereby triggering intestinal inflammation. Conversely, a Mediterranean nutritional pattern appears to be one of the most beneficial dietetic regimens able to restore the host intestinal physiology, by promoting eubiosis and preserving the intestinal barrier and immune function, which in turn create a virtuous cycle improving patient adherence to the pattern. Further clinical studies are warranted, to corroborate current IBD nutritional guidelines, and develop more accurate models to move forward precision nutrition and ameliorate patients' quality of life.",Florio M; Crudele L; Sallustio F; Moschetta A; Cariello M; Gadaleta RM,Molecular aspects of medicine,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39922085/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39882755,Precision nutrition-based interventions for the management of obesity in children and adolescents up to the age of 19 years.,"Precision nutrition-based methods develop tailored interventions and/or recommendations accounting for determinants of intra- and inter-individual variation in response to the same diet, compared to current 'one-size-fits-all' population-level approaches. Determinants may include genetics, current dietary habits and eating patterns, circadian rhythms, health status, gut microbiome, socioeconomic and psychosocial characteristics, and physical activity. ​​​​In this systematic review, we examined the evidence base for the effect of interventions based on precision nutrition approaches on overweight and obesity in children and adolescents to help inform future research and global guidelines. To examine the impact of precision nutrition-based interventions for the management of obesity in children and adolescents in all their diversity. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science Core Collection, BIOSIS Previews, Global Index Medicus (all regions), IBECS, SciELO, PAHO, PAHO IRIS, WHO IRIS, WHOLIS, Bibliomap, and TRoPHI, as well as the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov. We last searched the databases on 23 July 2024. We did not apply any language restrictions. We included randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that evaluated precision nutrition-based interventions (accounting for 'omics' such as phenotyping, genotyping, gut microbiome; clinical data, baseline dietary intake, postprandial glucose response, etc., and/or including artificial intelligence such as machine learning methods) compared to general or one-size-fits-all interventions or no intervention in children and adolescents aged 0 to 9 years or 10 to 19 years with overweight or obesity. Two review authors independently conducted study screening, data extraction, and risk of bias and GRADE assessments. We used fixed-effect analyses. Our outcomes of interest were physical and mental well-being, physical activity, health-related quality of life, obesity-associated disability, and adverse events associated with the interventions as defined or measured by trialists, and weight change (reduction, stabilisation or maintenance). Two studies (3 references, 105 participants) conducted in Ukraine and Greece met our eligibility criteria. One study reported nonprofit funding sources, whilst the other did not report funding, and the certainty of evidence ranged from very low to low across outcomes (all measured at endpoint). Only one trial (65 participants) contributed data on our primary outcomes of interest. Precision nutrition-based intervention versus one-size-fits-all intervention or standard of care In children 0 to 9 years of age, evidence is very uncertain about the effect of a precision nutrition-based intervention (a computerised Decision Support Tool (DST) that incorporates a variety of participant data and provides personalised diet recommendations based on decision-tree algorithms) on body mass index (BMI) (mean difference (MD) -1.40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.48 to 0.68; 1 study, 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and on weight (MD -2.60 kg, 95% CI -8.42 to 3.22; 1 study, 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence) compared with a one-size-fits-all control intervention. In children and adolescents 10 to 19 years of age, evidence is very uncertain about the effect of a precision nutrition-based intervention (computerised DST) on BMI (MD 3.00 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95% CI -0.26 to 6.26; 1 study, 30 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and on weight (MD 11.40 kg, 95% CI -0.47 to 23.27; 1 study, 30 participants; very low-certainty evidence) compared with a one-size-fits-all control intervention. Based on data from two small studies with a total of 105 participants, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of precision nutrition-based interventions on body weight or BMI. This review was limited by the number of available randomised controlled trials in this relatively nascent field. Given these limitations, the two studies do not provide sufficient evidence to adequately inform practice. Future research should report participant outcome data, including outcomes related to mental, emotional, and functional well-being, in addition to biochemical and physical measures, stratified by World Health Organization-defined age groups (children (0 to 9 years), and children and adolescents (10 to 19 years)).

39856267,Personalising dietary advice for disease prevention: concepts and experiences.,"Personalised nutrition (PN) as a new endeavour emerged in the background of the human genome project with the ease to analyse genetic heterogeneity. First commercial offers with recommendations for diet and lifestyle changes, usually based on a few polymorphisms, entered markets soon after the presentation of the human genome blueprint. Although PN has seen many attempts, meanwhile, with the inclusion of other biomedical measures such as microbiome and/or continuous glucose monitoring, scientific assessments of such approaches in various settings revealed limited success. Although personalisation improved general compliance over generic advice, particular benefits in referring to biomedical measures and individual risks did, in most cases, not provide any significant advantage. Moreover, scholars criticised such approaches as of limited impact from a public health perspective by attracting mainly technology-open individuals of high social status and proper financial capabilities. Based on these experiences, new avenues for personalising dietary advice are developed, and those are going beyond pure biomedical data by assessing the entire food environment of the individual with its capabilities and constraints in the given life setting. Embedded into digital environments for data collection but also for bidirectional communication, new possibilities emerge. Artificial intelligence methods allow for the multitude of input data and highly complex decision trees to be derived to customize advice. And that can be delivered on the spot and in time in any language whenever decisions are made on what to buy or what to eat.

39842720,Perspective: Multiomics and Artificial Intelligence for Personalized Nutritional Management of Diabetes in Patients Undergoing Peritoneal Dialysis.,"Managing diabetes in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) is challenging due to the combined effects of dietary glucose, glucose from dialysate, and other medical complications. Advances in technology that enable continuous biological data collection are transforming traditional management approaches. This review explores how multiomics technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) are enhancing glucose management in this patient population. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) offers significant advantages over traditional markers, such as hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Unlike HbA1c, which reflects an mean glucose level, CGM provides real-time, dynamic glucose data that allow clinicians to make timely adjustments, leading to better glycemic control and outcomes. Multiomics approaches are valuable for understanding genetic factors that influence susceptibility to diabetic complications, particularly those related to advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Identifying genetic polymorphisms that modify a patient's response to AGEs allows for personalized treatments, potentially reducing the severity of diabetes-related pathologies. Metabolomic analyses of PD effluent are also promising, as they help identify early biomarkers of metabolic dysregulation. Early detection can lead to timely interventions and more tailored treatment strategies, improving long-term patient care. AI integration is revolutionizing diabetes management for PD patients by processing vast datasets from CGM, genetic, metabolic, and microbiome profiles. AI can identify patterns and predict outcomes that may be difficult for humans to detect, enabling highly personalized recommendations for diet, medication, and dialysis management. Furthermore, AI can assist clinicians by automating data interpretation, improving treatment plans, and enhancing patient education. Despite the promise of these technologies, there are limitations. CGM, multiomics, and AI require significant investment in infrastructure, training, and validation studies. Additionally, integrating these approaches into clinical practice presents logistical and financial challenges. Nevertheless, personalized, data-driven strategies offer great potential for improving outcomes in diabetes management for PD patients.",Mahdavi S; Anthony NM; Sikaneta T; Tam PY,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39842720/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be the foremost cause of death all over the world. While the reasons that lead to increased risk for CVD are multifactorial, dyslipidemias, plasma concentrations of specific lipoproteins, and dynamic measures of lipoprotein function are strong biomarkers to predict and document coronary heart disease incidence. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the biomarkers and emerging approaches that can be utilized to characterize lipoprotein profiles as predictive tools for assessing CVD risk, including the assessment of traditional clinical lipid panels, measures of lipoprotein efflux capacity and inflammatory and antioxidant activity, and omics-based characterization of lipoprotein composition and regulators of lipoprotein metabolism. In addition, we discuss demographic, genetic, metagenomic, and lifestyle determinants of lipoprotein profiles-such as age, sex, gene variants and single-nucleotide polymorphisms, gut microbiome profiles, dietary patterns, physical inactivity, obesity status, smoking and alcohol intake, and stress-which are likely to be essential factors to explain interindividual responses to precision nutrition recommendations to mitigate CVD risk.",Andersen CJ; Fernandez ML,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39796476/,1,0,0,0,0,0

As such, it can be used to help shape the gut microbiome. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an increasingly promising therapy in disease states beyond recurrent <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infection, but diet is largely overlooked for its potential to help optimize this therapy. Therefore, the aim of this scoping review is to present the literature landscape that captures pre- and post-FMT dietary intake in humans, identify research gaps, and provide recommendations for future research. A comprehensive search strategy was developed and searches were run in five databases. Studies were included if they discussed adults who underwent FMT for any recognized treatment indication and had dietary intake as a study objective, this search encompassed studies with interventions that included foods and dietary supplements. The initial screening identified a total of 7721 articles, of which 18 met the inclusion criteria for this review. Studies were heterogeneous, but taken together, they introduce a framework that defines important nutritional considerations for both donors and FMT recipients in the period around FMT dosing.

39710263,International Symposium on Ruminant Physiology: Maternal nutrient supply-Impacts on physiological and whole-animal outcomes in offspring.,"Demands for animal products are projected to increase in the future, and animal production is key to agricultural sustainability and food security; consequently, enhancing ruminant livestock production efficiencies in sustainable ways is a major goal for the livestock industry. Developmental programming is the concept that various stressors, including compromised maternal nutrition during critical developmental windows will result in both short- and long-term changes in the offspring. Ruminant models of developmental programming indicate that compromised maternal nutrition, including global under- and overnutrition, macronutrients, and specific micronutrients, including amino acids (Met and Arg), vitamins (folate, B<sub>12</sub>, and choline), and minerals (sulfur, cobalt, and selenium) can alter offspring outcomes. Data also suggest that maternal histotrophic composition, placental function, and likely fetal nutrient supply are altered by compromised maternal nutrition. Likewise, in offspring, visceral organ mass and function, metabolism, growth, and reproduction are affected. Findings from multi-omics approaches demonstrate that compromised maternal nutrition alters transcript abundance, metabolomic profiles, and multiple metabolic pathways. The underlying mechanisms of developmental programming are driven by epigenetic events, which depend on one-carbon metabolism and micronutrient supply. Current findings indicate that developmental programming in ruminants is real, that maternal nutrition can be a major driver of developmental programming, and that genomic and metabolomic changes in offspring are modulated by altered maternal nutrition during critical windows of development. Research needs in the area of developmental programming in ruminants include enhanced understanding of the underlying mechanisms, practical relevance to production systems, effects on short- and long-term animal health including longevity, interrelationships between maternal and paternal influences, intergenerational effects, and interrelationships with the host microbiome. Additionally, strategic supplementation and precision nutrition approaches should be developed to foster the positive and mitigate the negative aspects of developmental programming to improve the efficiency and sustainability of ruminant livestock production systems.",Caton JS; Crouse MS; Dahlen CR; Ward AK; Diniz WJS; Hammer CJ; Swanson RM; Hauxwell KM; Syring JG; Safain KS; Reynolds LP,Journal of dairy science,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39710263/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39683427,Biomarker-Guided Dietary Supplementation: A Narrative Review of Precision in Personalized Nutrition.,"<b>Background:</b> Dietary supplements (DS) are widely used to address nutritional deficiencies and promote health, yet their indiscriminate use often leads to reduced efficacy, adverse effects, and safety concerns. Biomarker-driven approaches have emerged as a promising strategy to optimize DS prescriptions, ensuring precision and reducing risks associated with generic recommendations. <b>Methods:</b> This narrative review synthesizes findings from key studies on biomarker-guided dietary supplementation and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in biomarker analysis. Key biomarker categories-genomic, proteomic, metabolomic, lipidomic, microbiome, and immunological-were reviewed, alongside AI applications for interpreting these biomarkers and tailoring supplement prescriptions. <b>Results:</b> Biomarkers enable the identification of deficiencies, metabolic imbalances, and disease predispositions, supporting targeted and safe DS use. For example, genomic markers like MTHFR polymorphisms inform folate supplementation needs, while metabolomic markers such as glucose and insulin levels guide interventions in metabolic disorders. AI-driven tools streamline biomarker interpretation, optimize supplement selection, and enhance therapeutic outcomes by accounting for complex biomarker interactions and individual needs. <b>Limitations:</b> Despite these advancements, AI tools face significant challenges, including reliance on incomplete training datasets and a limited number of clinically validated algorithms. Additionally, most current research focuses on clinical populations, limiting generalizability to healthier populations. Long-term studies remain scarce, raising questions about the sustained efficacy and safety of biomarker-guided supplementation. Regulatory ambiguity further complicates the classification of supplements, especially when combinations exhibit pharmaceutical-like effects. <b>Conclusions:</b> Biomarker-guided DS prescription, augmented by AI, represents a cornerstone of personalized nutrition. While offering significant potential for precision and efficacy, advancing these strategies requires addressing challenges such as incomplete AI data, regulatory uncertainties, and the lack of long-term studies. By overcoming these obstacles, clinicians can better meet individual health needs, prevent diseases, and integrate precision nutrition into routine care.",Pokushalov E; Ponomarenko A; Shrainer E; Kudlay D; Miller R,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39683427/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Beyond microbial viability.","Highly prevalent comorbidities associated with metabolic syndrome, such as abdominal obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and insulin-resistance/Type 2 diabetes (IR/T2D) share alterations in gut microbiota composition as a potential triggering factor. Recent studies put the attention in the potential usage of postbiotics (inactivated probiotics) on these metabolic alterations. This review summarizes the current evidence regarding the efficacy of postbiotic administration in both, preclinical and clinical studies, for the management of obesity, NAFLD and IR/T2D. Data from preclinical studies (rodents) suggest that postbiotic administration effectively prevents obesity, whereas clinical studies corroborate these benefits also in overweight/obese subjects receiving inactivated bacteria. As for NAFLD, although preclinical studies indicate that postbiotic administration improves different liver markers, no data obtained in humans have been published so far since all the studies are ongoing clinical trials. Finally, while the administration of inactivated bacteria demonstrated to be a promising approach for the management of IR/T2D in rodents, data from clinical trials indicates that in humans, this approach is more effective on IR than in T2D. In conclusion, the available scientific data indicate that postbiotic administration not only is safer, but also as effective as probiotic administration for the management of obesity associated prevalent metabolic alterations.",Arellano-García LI; Portillo MP; Martínez JA; Courtois A; Milton-Laskibar I,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39644489/,1,0,0,0,0,0

39467522,Barriers in Translating Existing Nutrigenetics Insights to Precision Nutrition for Cardiometabolic Health in Ethnically Diverse Populations.,"Cardiometabolic diseases pose a significant threat to global public health, with a substantial majority of cardiovascular disease mortality (more than three-quarters) occurring in low- and middle-income countries. There have been remarkable advances in recent years in identifying genetic variants that alter disease susceptibility by interacting with dietary factors. Despite the remarkable progress, several factors need to be considered before the translation of nutrigenetics insights to personalised and precision nutrition in ethnically diverse populations. Some of these factors include variations in genetic predispositions, cultural and lifestyle factors as well as socio-economic factors. This review aimed to explore the factors that need to be considered in bridging the gap between existing nutrigenetics insights and the implementation of personalised and precision nutrition across diverse ethnicities. Several factors might influence variations among individuals with regard to dietary exposures and metabolic responses, and these include genetic diversity, cultural and lifestyle factors as well as socio-economic factors. A multi-omics approach involving disciplines such as metabolomics, epigenetics, and the gut microbiome might contribute to improved understanding of the underlying mechanisms of gene-diet interactions and the implementation of precision nutrition although more research is needed to confirm the practicality and effectiveness of this approach. Conducting gene-diet interaction studies in diverse populations is essential and studies utilising large sample sizes are required as this improves the power to detect interactions with minimal effect sizes. Future studies should focus on replicating initial findings to enhance reliability and promote comparison across studies. Once findings have been replicated in independent samples, dietary intervention studies will be required to further strengthen the evidence and facilitate their application in clinical practice. Nutrigenetics has a potential role to play in the prevention and management of cardiometabolic diseases. Conducting gene-diet interaction studies in diverse populations is essential giving the genetic diversity and variations in dietary patterns. Integrating data from disciplines such as metabolomics, epigenetics, and the gut microbiome could help in early identification of individuals at risk of cardiometabolic diseases as well as the implementation of precise dietary interventions for preventing and managing cardiometabolic diseases.",Wuni R; Vimaleswaran KS,Lifestyle genomics,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39467522/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39418223,Gut microbiota determines the fate of dietary fiber-targeted interventions in host health.,"Epidemiological investigation confirmed that the intake of dietary fiber (DF) is closely related to human health, and the most important factor affecting the physiological function of DF, besides its physicochemical properties, is the gut microbiota. This paper mainly summarizes the interaction between DF and gut microbiota, including the influence of DF on the colonization of gut microbiota based on its different physicochemical properties, and the physiological role of gut microbiota in destroying the complex molecular structure of DF by encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes, thus producing small molecular products that affect the metabolism of the host. Taking cardiovascular disease (Atherosclerosis and hypertension), liver disease, and immune diseases as examples, it is confirmed that some DF, such as fructo-oligosaccharide, galactooligosaccharide, xylo-oligosaccharide, and inulin, have prebiotic-like physiological effects. These effects are dependent on the metabolites produced by the gut microbiota. Therefore, this paper further explores how DF affects the gut microbiota's production of substances such as short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, and tryptophan metabolites, and provides a preliminary explanation of the mechanisms associated with their impact on host health. Finally, based on the structural properties of DF and the large heterogeneity in the composition of the population gut microbiota, it may be a future trend to utilize DF and the gut microbiota to correlate host health for precision nutrition by combining the information from population disease databases.",Wang W; Fan Z; Yan Q; Pan T; Luo J; Wei Y; Li B; Fang Z; Lu W,Gut microbes,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39418223/,1,0,0,0,0,0

However, the mechanisms by which these microorganisms contribute to cancer development are complex and far from completely clarified. Specifically, the impact of gut microbiota-derived metabolites on CRC is undeniable, exerting both protective and detrimental effects. This paper examines the effects and mechanisms by which important bacterial metabolites exert detrimental effects associated with increased risk of CRC. Metabolites considered include heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heme iron, secondary bile acids, ethanol, and aromatic amines. It is necessary to delve deeper into the mechanisms of action of these metabolites in CRC and identify the microbiota members involved in their production.

In neonates fed with breast milk, jaundice is particularly prevalent and severe, which is likely multifactorial. With the development of genomics and metagenomics, a deeper understanding of the neonatal gut microbiota has been achieved. We find there are accumulating evidence to indicate the importance of the gut microbiota in the mechanism of jaundice. In this paper, we present new comprehensive insight into the relationship between the microbiota and jaundice. In the new perspective, the gut is a crucial crossroad of bilirubin excretion, and bacteria colonizing the gut could play different roles in the excretion of bilirubin, including <i>Escherichia coli</i> as the main traffic jam causers, some <i>Clostridium</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i> strains as the traffic police, and most probiotic <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i> strains as bystanders with no effect or only a secondary indirect effect on the metabolism of bilirubin. This insight could explain why breast milk jaundice causes a longer duration of blood bilirubin and why most probiotics have limited effects on neonatal jaundice.

39047690,Precision Nutrition for Management of Cardiovascular Disease Risk during Menopause.,"Women can spend up to 40% of their lives in the postmenopausal state. As women begin to transition into menopause, known as perimenopause, changes in hormonal concentrations and body composition dramatically increase overall cardiometabolic risk. Dietary patterns and interventions can be utilized to prevent and treat cardiovascular disease (CVD) and some dietary patterns over others may be more beneficial due to their specific effects on the health aspects of menopause. In this narrative review, we summarize key cardiovascular alterations that occur during the menopause transition and explore current dietary recommendations to address CVD risk as well as explore the new frontier of precision nutrition and the implications for nutrition prescription during menopause. Popular dietary interventions for CVD such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and the Mediterranean diet (MED) have limited data in women following menopause. However, both diets improve CVD risk biomarkers of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as well as lower oxidative stress and inflammation and improve endothelial function. As the menopause transition increases the risk for developing metabolic syndrome, insulin insensitivity, and dyslipidemia, the DASH diet and MED may be impactful dietary strategies for mediating CVD risk in menopausal women. However, these are ""one-size-fits-all"" approaches that neglect individual characteristics such as genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Precision nutrition considers individual factors for nutrition prescription, spanning from evaluating food intake preferences and behaviors to deep phenotyping. Data from a large-scale investigation of the menopause transition suggests nutritional strategies that address postprandial glycemic responses, and the gut microbiome may attenuate some of the unfavorable effects of menopause on CVD risk factors. Considering menopause, women are a clinical population that would greatly benefit from precision nutrition. Future research should explore the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence in a precision nutrition framework to modify the DASH diet and MED to address adverse effects that occur during the menopause transition are vital for supporting women's health as they age.",Cabre HE; Woolf EK; Redman LM,Lifestyle genomics,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39047690/,1,0,0,0,0,0

From the Low-FODMAP diet to neuro-gut interventions, these strategies provide a holistic understanding of the gut's dynamic world. Precision nutrition, as a groundbreaking discipline, holds transformative potential by tailoring dietary recommendations to individual gut microbiota compositions, reshaping the landscape of gastrointestinal health. Recent advancements in clinical indications, including exact probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and neuro-gut interventions, signify a new era where the gut microbiome actively participates in therapeutic strategies. As the microbiome takes center stage in healthcare, a paradigm shift toward personalized and effective treatments for gastrointestinal disorders emerges, reflecting the symbiotic relationship between the human body and its microbial companions.",Shang Z; Pai L; Patil S,Frontiers in nutrition,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38873568/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38823877,Deciphering the core microbes and their interactions in spontaneous Baijiu fermentation: A comprehensive review.,"The spontaneous Baijiu fermentation system harbors a complex microbiome that is highly dynamic in time and space and varies depending on the Jiuqu starters and environmental factors. The intricate microbiota presents in the fermentation environment is responsible for carrying out various reactions. These reactions necessitate the interaction among the core microbes to influence the community function, ultimately shaping the distinct Baijiu styles through the process of spontaneous fermentation. Numerous studies have been conducted to enhance our understanding of the diversity, succession, and function of microbial communities with the aim of improving fermentation manipulation. However, a comprehensive and critical assessment of the core microbes and their interaction remains one of the significant challenges in the Baijiu fermentation industry. This paper focuses on the fermentation properties of core microbes. We discuss the state of the art of microbial traceability, highlighting the crucial role of environmental and starter microbiota in the Baijiu brewing microbiome. Also, we discuss the various interactions between microbes in the Baijiu production system and propose a potential conceptual framework that involves constructing predictive network models to simplify and quantify microbial interactions using co-culture models. This approach offers effective strategies for understanding the core microbes and their interactions, thus beneficial for the management of microbiota and the regulation of interactions in Baijiu fermentation processes.",Kang J; Huang X; Li R; Zhang Y; Chen XX; Han BZ,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38823877/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38785965,"Biological Rhythms, Chrono-Nutrition, and Gut Microbiota: Epigenomics Insights for Precision Nutrition and Metabolic Health.","Circadian rhythms integrate a finely tuned network of biological processes recurring every 24 h, intricately coordinating the machinery of all cells. This self-regulating system plays a pivotal role in synchronizing physiological and behavioral responses, ensuring an adaptive metabolism within the environmental milieu, including dietary and physical activity habits. The systemic integration of circadian homeostasis involves a balance of biological rhythms, each synchronically linked to the central circadian clock. Central to this orchestration is the temporal dimension of nutrient and food intake, an aspect closely interwoven with the neuroendocrine circuit, gut physiology, and resident microbiota. Indeed, the timing of meals exerts a profound influence on cell cycle regulation through genomic and epigenetic processes, particularly those involving gene expression, DNA methylation and repair, and non-coding RNA activity. These (epi)genomic interactions involve a dynamic interface between circadian rhythms, nutrition, and the gut microbiota, shaping the metabolic and immune landscape of the host. This research endeavors to illustrate the intricate (epi)genetic interplay that modulates the synchronization of circadian rhythms, nutritional signaling, and the gut microbiota, unravelling the repercussions on metabolic health while suggesting the potential benefits of feed circadian realignment as a non-invasive therapeutic strategy for systemic metabolic modulation via gut microbiota. This exploration delves into the interconnections that underscore the significance of temporal eating patterns, offering insights regarding circadian rhythms, gut microbiota, and chrono-nutrition interactions with (epi)genomic phenomena, thereby influencing diverse aspects of metabolic, well-being, and quality of life outcomes.",de Oliveira Melo NC; Cuevas-Sierra A; Souto VF; Martínez JA,Biomolecules,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38785965/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38728013,Conjugated linoleic acid metabolite impact in colorectal cancer: a potential microbiome-based precision nutrition approach.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most deadly and the third most diagnosed cancer in both sexes worldwide. CRC pathogenesis is associated with risk factors such as genetics, alcohol, smoking, sedentariness, obesity, unbalanced diets, and gut microbiota dysbiosis. The gut microbiota is the microbial community living in symbiosis in the intestine, in a dynamic balance vital for health. Increasing evidence underscores the influence of specific gut microbiota bacterial species on CRC incidence and pathogenesis. In this regard, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) metabolites produced by certain gut microbiota have demonstrated an anticarcinogenic effect in CRC, influencing pathways for inflammation, proliferation, and apoptosis. CLA production occurs naturally in the rumen, and human bioavailability is through the consumption of food derived from ruminants. In recent years, biotechnological attempts to increase CLA bioavailability in humans have been unfruitful. Therefore, the conversion of essential dietary linoleic acid to CLA metabolite by specific intestinal bacteria has become a promising process. This article reviews the evidence regarding CLA and CLA-producing bacteria as therapeutic agents against CRC and investigates the best strategy for increasing the yield and bioavailability of CLA. Given the potential and limitations of the present strategies, a new microbiome-based precision nutrition approach based on endogenous CLA production by human gut bacteria is proposed. A literature search in the PubMed and PubMed Central databases identified 794 papers on human gut bacteria associated with CLA production. Of these, 51 studies exploring association consistency were selected. After excluding 19 papers, due to health concerns or discrepancies between studies, 32 papers were selected for analysis, encompassing data for 38 CLA-producing bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species. The information was analyzed by a bioinformatics food recommendation system patented by our research group, Phymofood (EP22382095). This paper presents a new microbiome-based precision nutrition approach targeting CLA-producing gut bacterial species to maximize the anticarcinogenic effect of CLA in CRC.",González A; Fullaondo A; Rodríguez J; Tirnauca C; Odriozola I; Odriozola A,Nutrition reviews,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38728013/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38683435,In vitro and in vivo fermentation models to study the function of dietary fiber in pig nutrition.,"The importance of dietary fiber (DF) in animal diets is increasing with the advancement of nutritional research. DF is fermented by gut microbiota to produce metabolites, which are important in improving intestinal health. This review is a systematic review of DF in pig nutrition using in vitro and in vivo models. The fermentation characteristics of DF and the metabolic mechanisms of its metabolites were summarized in an in vitro model, and it was pointed out that SCFAs and gases are the important metabolites connecting DF, gut microbiota, and intestinal health, and they play a key role in intestinal health. At the same time, some information about host-microbe interactions could have been improved through traditional animal in vivo models, and the most direct feedback on nutrients was generated, confirming the beneficial effects of DF on sow reproductive performance, piglet intestinal health, and growing pork quality. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of different fermentation models were compared. In future studies, it is necessary to flexibly combine in vivo and in vitro fermentation models to profoundly investigate the mechanism of DF on the organism in order to promote the development of precision nutrition tools and to provide a scientific basis for the in-depth and rational utilization of DF in animal husbandry. KEY POINTS: • The fermentation characteristics of dietary fiber in vitro models were reviewed. • Metabolic pathways of metabolites and their roles in the intestine were reviewed. • The role of dietary fiber in pigs at different stages was reviewed.",Huangfu W; Cao S; Li S; Zhang S; Liu M; Liu B; Zhu X; Cui Y; Wang Z; Zhao J; Shi Y,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38683435/,0,1,0,0,0,0
38474710,"Precision Nutrition Unveiled: Gene-Nutrient Interactions, Microbiota Dynamics, and Lifestyle Factors in Obesity Management.","Obesity is a complex metabolic disorder that is associated with several diseases. Recently, precision nutrition (PN) has emerged as a tailored approach to provide individualised dietary recommendations. This review discusses the major intrinsic and extrinsic components considered when applying PN during the management of obesity and common associated chronic conditions. The review identified three main PN components: gene-nutrient interactions, intestinal microbiota, and lifestyle factors. Genetic makeup significantly contributes to inter-individual variations in dietary behaviours, with advanced genome sequencing and population genetics aiding in detecting gene variants associated with obesity. Additionally, PN-based host-microbiota evaluation emerges as an advanced therapeutic tool, impacting disease control and prevention. The gut microbiome's composition regulates diverse responses to nutritional recommendations. Several studies highlight PN's effectiveness in improving diet quality and enhancing adherence to physical activity among obese patients. PN is a key strategy for addressing obesity-related risk factors, encompassing dietary patterns, body weight, fat, blood lipids, glucose levels, and insulin resistance. PN stands out as a feasible tool for effectively managing obesity, considering its ability to integrate genetic and lifestyle factors. The application of PN-based approaches not only improves current obesity conditions but also holds promise for preventing obesity and its associated complications in the long term.",Mansour S; Alkhaaldi SMI; Sammanasunathan AF; Ibrahim S; Farhat J; Al-Omari B,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38474710/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38374554,"Precision nutrition in pediatric IBD: A position paper from the ESPGHAN special interest group for basic science and translational research, the IBD Porto group, and allied health professionals.","Stratified and precision nutrition refers to disease management or prevention of disease onset, based on dietary interventions tailored to a person's characteristics, biology, gut microbiome, and environmental exposures. Such treatment models may lead to more effective management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and reduce risk of disease development. This societal position paper aimed to report advances made in stratified and precision nutritional therapy in IBD. Following a structured literature search, limited to human studies, we identified four relevant themes: (a) nutritional epidemiology for risk prediction of IBD development, (b) food-based dietary interventions in IBD, (c) exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) for Crohn's disease (CD) management, and (d) pre- and probiotics for IBD management. There is scarce literature upon which we can make recommendations for precision or stratified dietary therapy for IBD, both for risk of disease development and disease management. Certain single-nucleotide polymorphisms related to polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolism may modify the effect dietary PUFA have in increasing the risk of IBD development. Non-colonic CD, mild-to-moderate CD, and high microbiota richness may predict success of EEN and may be used both for prediction of treatment continuation, but also for early cessation in nonresponders. There is currently insufficient evidence to make recommendations for precision or stratified dietary therapy for patients with established IBD. Despite the great interest in stratified and precision nutrition, we currently lack data to support conclusive recommendations.

38316343,Potential Mechanisms of Precision Nutrition-Based Interventions for Managing Obesity.,"Precision nutrition (PN) considers multiple individual-level and environmental characteristics or variables to better inform dietary strategies and interventions for optimizing health, including managing obesity and metabolic disorders. Here, we review the evidence on potential mechanisms-including ones to identify individuals most likely to respond-that can be leveraged in the development of PN interventions addressing obesity. We conducted a review of the literature and included laboratory, animal, and human studies evaluating biochemical and genetic data, completed and ongoing clinical trials, and public programs in this review. Our analysis describes the potential mechanisms related to 6 domains including genetic predisposition, circadian rhythms, physical activity and sedentary behavior, metabolomics, the gut microbiome, and behavioral and socioeconomic characteristics, i.e., the factors that can be leveraged to design PN-based interventions to prevent and treat obesity-related outcomes such as weight loss or metabolic health as laid out by the NIH 2030 Strategic Plan for Nutrition Research. For example, single nucleotide polymorphisms can modify responses to certain dietary interventions, and epigenetic modulation of obesity risk via physical activity patterns and macronutrient intake have also been demonstrated. Additionally, we identified limitations including questions of equitable implementation across a limited number of clinical trials. These include the limited ability of current PN interventions to address systemic influences such as supply chains and food distribution, healthcare systems, racial or cultural inequities, and economic disparities, particularly when designing and implementing PN interventions in low- and middle-income communities. PN has the potential to help manage obesity by addressing intra- and inter-individual variation as well as context, as opposed to ""one-size fits all"" approaches though there is limited clinical trial evidence to date.",Mehta NH; Huey SL; Kuriyan R; Peña-Rosas JP; Finkelstein JL; Kashyap S; Mehta S,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38316343/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38219722,Application of Gut Bacterial Profiling Information in Precision Nutrition for Obesity and Weight Loss Management.,"It has been suggested that the dysfunction of the gut microbiome can have deleterious effects on the regulation of body weight and adiposity by affecting energy metabolism. In this context, gut bacterial profiling studies have contributed to characterize specific bacteria associated with obesity. This review covers the information driven by gut bacterial profiling analyses and emphasizes the potential application of this knowledge in precision nutrition strategies for obesity understanding and weight loss management. Gut bacterial profiling studies have identified bacterial families that are more abundant in obese than in nonobese individuals (i.e., Prevotellaeae, Ruminococcaceae, and Veillonellaceae) as well as other families that have been repeatedly found more abundant in nonobese people (i.e., Christensenellaceae and Coriobacteriaceae), suggesting that an increase in their relative amount could be an interesting target in weight-loss treatments. Also, some gut-derived metabolites have been related to the regulation of body weight, including short-chain fatty acids, trimethylamine-N-oxide, and branched-chain and aromatic amino acids. Moreover, gut microbiota profiles may play a role in determining weight loss responses to specific nutritional treatments for the precise management of obesity. Thus, incorporating gut microbiota features may improve the performance of integrative models to predict weight loss outcomes. The application of gut bacterial profiling information is of great value for precision nutrition in metabolic diseases since it contributes to the understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in obesity onset and progression, facilitates the identification of potential microorganism targets, and allows the personalization of tailored weight loss diets as well as the prediction of adiposity outcomes based on the gut bacterial profiling of each individual. Integrating microbiota information with other omics knowledge (genetics, epigenetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular and physiological events underlying obesity and adiposity outcomes for precision nutrition.",Ramos-Lopez O; Aranaz P; Riezu-Boj JI; Milagro FI,Lifestyle genomics,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38219722/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Emerging insights into diet-microbiota interactions indicate that nutrition has a dominant influence on the composition-and metabolic output-of the intestinal microbiota, which in turn has major consequences for host immunity and inflammation. Here, we discuss recent findings that support the concept that dietary effects on microbiota-derived metabolites potently alter immune responses in health and disease. We discuss how specific dietary components and metabolites can be either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory in a context- and tissue-dependent manner during infection, chronic inflammation, and cancer. Together, these studies emphasize the influence of diet-microbiota crosstalk on immune regulation that will have a significant impact on precision nutrition approaches and therapeutic interventions for managing inflammation, infection, and cancer immunotherapy.",Arifuzzaman M; Collins N; Guo CJ; Artis D,Immunity,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38198849/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38075858,A toolbox of machine learning software to support microbiome analysis.,"The human microbiome has become an area of intense research due to its potential impact on human health. However, the analysis and interpretation of this data have proven to be challenging due to its complexity and high dimensionality. Machine learning (ML) algorithms can process vast amounts of data to uncover informative patterns and relationships within the data, even with limited prior knowledge. Therefore, there has been a rapid growth in the development of software specifically designed for the analysis and interpretation of microbiome data using ML techniques. These software incorporate a wide range of ML algorithms for clustering, classification, regression, or feature selection, to identify microbial patterns and relationships within the data and generate predictive models. This rapid development with a constant need for new developments and integration of new features require efforts into compile, catalog and classify these tools to create infrastructures and services with easy, transparent, and trustable standards. Here we review the state-of-the-art for ML tools applied in human microbiome studies, performed as part of the COST Action ML4Microbiome activities. This scoping review focuses on ML based software and framework resources currently available for the analysis of microbiome data in humans. The aim is to support microbiologists and biomedical scientists to go deeper into specialized resources that integrate ML techniques and facilitate future benchmarking to create standards for the analysis of microbiome data. The software resources are organized based on the type of analysis they were developed for and the ML techniques they implement. A description of each software with examples of usage is provided including comments about pitfalls and lacks in the usage of software based on ML methods in relation to microbiome data that need to be considered by developers and users.

37897982,Effect of low-and non-calorie sweeteners on the gut microbiota: A review of clinical trials and cross-sectional studies.,"Use of non-nutritive sweeteners (NNSs) has increased worldwide in recent decades. However, evidence from preclinical studies shows that sweetener consumption may induce glucose intolerance through changes in the gut microbiota, which raises public health concerns. As studies conducted on humans are lacking, the aim of this review was to gather and summarize the current evidence on the effects of NNSs on human gut microbiota. Only clinical trials and cross-sectional studies were included in the review. Regarding NNSs (i.e, saccharin, sucralose, aspartame, and stevia), only two of five clinical trials showed significant changes in gut microbiota composition after the intervention protocol. These studies concluded that saccharin and sucralose impair glycemic tolerance. In three of the four cross-sectional studies an association between NNSs and the microbial composition was observed. All three clinical trials on polyols (i.e, xylitol) showed prebiotic effects on gut microbiota, but these studies had multiple limitations (publication date, dosage, duration) that jeopardize their validity. The microbial response to NNSs consumption could be strongly mediated by the gut microbial composition at baseline. Further studies in which the potential personalized microbial response to NNSs consumption is acknowledged, and that include longer intervention protocols, larger cohorts, and more realistic sweetener dosage are needed to broaden these findings.",Gauthier E; Milagro FI; Navas-Carretero S,"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37897982/,1,0,0,0,0,0

This mini review explores preprocessing and transformation methods applied in recent human microbiome studies to address microbiome data analysis challenges. Our results indicate a limited adoption of transformation methods targeting the statistical characteristics of microbiome sequencing data. Instead, there is a prevalent usage of relative and normalization-based transformations that do not specifically account for the specific attributes of microbiome data. The information on preprocessing and transformations applied to the data before analysis was incomplete or missing in many publications, leading to reproducibility concerns, comparability issues, and questionable results. We hope this mini review will provide researchers and newcomers to the field of human microbiome research with an up-to-date point of reference for various data transformation tools and assist them in choosing the most suitable transformation method based on their research questions, objectives, and data characteristics.",Ibrahimi E; Lopes MB; Dhamo X; Simeon A; Shigdel R; Hron K; Stres B; D'Elia D; Berland M; Marcos-Zambrano LJ,Frontiers in microbiology,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37869650/,1,0,0,0,0,0

This review focuses on the recent developments and updates in the field, including the analytical methodologies that encompass improved instrument sensitivity, sampling techniques and data integration (multiomics). Metabolomics has advanced the discovery and validation of dietary biomarkers and their implementation in health research. Metabolomics has come to play an important role in the understanding of the role of small molecules resulting from the diet-microbiota interactions when gut microbiota research has shifted towards improving the understanding of the activity and functionality of gut microbiota rather than composition alone. Currently, metabolomics plays an emerging role in precision nutrition and the recent developments therein are discussed.",Kortesniemi M; Noerman S; Kårlund A; Raita J; Meuronen T; Koistinen V; Landberg R; Hanhineva K,Current opinion in chemical biology,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37804582/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37764683,The Role of Lipids in the Regulation of Immune Responses.,"Lipid metabolism plays a major role in the regulation of the immune system. Exogenous (dietary and microbial-derived) and endogenous (non-microbial-derived) lipids play a direct role in regulating immune cell activation, differentiation and expansion, and inflammatory phenotypes. Understanding the complexities of lipid-immune interactions may have important implications for human health, as certain lipids or immune pathways may be beneficial in circumstances of acute infection yet detrimental in chronic inflammatory diseases. Further, there are key differences in the lipid effects between specific immune cell types and location (e.g., gut mucosal vs. systemic immune cells), suggesting that the immunomodulatory properties of lipids may be tissue-compartment-specific, although the direct effect of dietary lipids on the mucosal immune system warrants further investigation. Importantly, there is recent evidence to suggest that lipid-immune interactions are dependent on sex, metabolic status, and the gut microbiome in preclinical models. While the lipid-immune relationship has not been adequately established in/translated to humans, research is warranted to evaluate the differences in lipid-immune interactions across individuals and whether the optimization of lipid-immune interactions requires precision nutrition approaches to mitigate or manage disease. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms by which lipids regulate immune responses and the influence of dietary lipids on these processes, highlighting compelling areas for future research.",Garcia C; Andersen CJ; Blesso CN,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37764683/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37702886,Precision Nutrition and Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction: the Promise of High-Density Lipoproteins.,"Emerging evidence supports the promise of precision nutritional approaches for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. Here, we discuss current findings from precision nutrition trials and studies reporting substantial inter-individual variability in responses to diets and dietary components relevant to CVD outcomes. We highlight examples where early precision nutrition research already points to actionable intervention targets tailored to an individual's biology and lifestyle. Finally, we make the case for high-density lipoproteins (HDL) as a compelling next generation target for precision nutrition aimed at CVD prevention. HDL possesses complex structural features including diverse protein components, lipids, size distribution, extensive glycosylation, and interacts with the gut microbiome, all of which influence HDL's anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and cholesterol efflux properties. Elucidating the nuances of HDL structure and function at an individual level may unlock personalized dietary and lifestyle strategies to optimize HDL-mediated atheroprotection and reduce CVD risk. Recent human studies have demonstrated that HDL particles are key players in the reduction of CVD risk. Our review highlights the role of HDL and the importance of personalized therapeutic approaches to improve their potential for reducing CVD risk. Factors such as diet, genetics, glycosylation, and gut microbiome interactions can modulate HDL structure and function at the individual level. We emphasize that fractionating HDL into size-based subclasses and measuring particle concentration are necessary to understand HDL biology and for developing the next generation of diagnostics and biomarkers. These discoveries underscore the need to move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach to HDL management. Precision nutrition strategies that account for personalized metabolic, genetic, and lifestyle data hold promise for optimizing HDL therapies and function to mitigate CVD risk more potently. While human studies show HDL play a key role in reducing CVD risk, recent findings indicate that factors such as diet, genetics, glycosylation, and gut microbes modulate HDL function at the individual level, underscoring the need for precision nutrition strategies that account for personalized variability to optimize HDL's potential for mitigating CVD risk.",Hong BV; Agus JK; Tang X; Zheng JJ; Romo EZ; Lei S; Zivkovic AM,Current atherosclerosis reports,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37702886/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37610590,Precision Nutrition to Improve Risk Factors of Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes.,"Existing dietary and lifestyle interventions and recommendations, to improve the risk factors of obesity and type 2 diabetes with the target to mitigate this double global epidemic, have produced inconsistent results due to interpersonal variabilities in response to these conventional approaches, and inaccuracies in dietary assessment methods. Precision nutrition, an emerging strategy, tailors an individual's key characteristics such as diet, phenotype, genotype, metabolic biomarkers, and gut microbiome for personalized dietary recommendations to optimize dietary response and health. Precision nutrition is suggested to be an alternative and potentially more effective strategy to improve dietary intake and prevention of obesity and chronic diseases. The purpose of this narrative review is to synthesize the current research and examine the state of the science regarding the effect of precision nutrition in improving the risk factors of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The results of the research review indicate to a large extent significant evidence supporting the effectiveness of precision nutrition in improving the risk factors of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Deeper insights and further rigorous research into the diet-phenotype-genotype and interactions of other components of precision nutrition may enable this innovative approach to be adapted in health care and public health to the special needs of individuals. Precision nutrition provides the strategy to make individualized dietary recommendations by integrating genetic, phenotypic, nutritional, lifestyle, medical, social, and other pertinent characteristics about individuals, as a means to address the challenges of generalized dietary recommendations. The evidence presented in this review shows that precision nutrition markedly improves risk factors of obesity and type 2 diabetes, particularly behavior change.",Antwi J,Current nutrition reports,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37610590/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37545571,Bioactive compounds for human and planetary health.,"Bioactive compounds found in edible plants and foods are vital for human and planetary health, yet their significance remains underappreciated. These natural bioactives, as part of whole diets, ingredients, or supplements, can modulate multiple aspects of human health and wellness. Recent advancements in omic sciences and computational biology, combined with the development of Precision Nutrition, have contributed to the convergence of nutrition and medicine, as well as more efficient and affordable healthcare solutions that harness the power of food for prevention and therapy. Innovation in this field is crucial to feed a growing global population sustainably and healthily. This requires significant changes in our food system, spanning agriculture, production, distribution and consumption. As we are facing pressing planetary health challenges, investing in bioactive-based solutions is an opportunity to protect biodiversity and the health of our soils, waters, and the atmosphere, while also creating value for consumers, patients, communities, and stakeholders. Such research and innovation targets include alternative proteins, such as cellular agriculture and plant-derived protein; natural extracts that improve shelf-life as natural preservatives; upcycling of agricultural by-products to reduce food waste; and the development of natural alternatives to synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. Translational research and innovation in the field of natural bioactives are currently being developed at two levels, using a systems-oriented approach. First, at the biological level, the interplay between these compounds and the human host and microbiome is being elucidated through omics research, big data and artificial intelligence, to accelerate both discovery and validation. Second, at the ecosystem level, efforts are focused on producing diverse nutrient-rich, flavorful, and resilient, yet high-yield agricultural crops, and educating consumers to make informed choices that benefit both their health and the planet. Adopting a system-oriented perspective helps: unravel the intricate and dynamic relationships between bioactives, nutrition, and sustainability outcomes, harnessing the power of nature to promote human health and wellbeing; foster sustainable agriculture and protect the ecosystem.

Recently, improving skin health through probiotic interventions has been proposed, and micro-ecological skin care is becoming a popular concept. By regulating skin health and gut-skin axis interactions, probiotics can be used as potential management tools to suppress and improve skin diseases in multiple ways, including decreasing oxidative stress, suppressing inflammatory responses, and keeping immune effects. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the application and mechanisms of probiotic-mediated gut microbiota homeostasis in skin care and to offer a theoretical basis for the application of probiotics in skin care.",Gao T; Wang X; Li Y; Ren F,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37513540/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37499703,Food and drug design for gut microbiota-directed regulation: Current experimental landscape and future innovation.,"Most diets and medications enhance host health via microbiota-dependent ways, but it is in the present situation of untargeted regulation. Non-targeted regulation may lead to the ineffectiveness of dietary supplements or drug treatment. Microbiota-directed food, aiming to improve diseases by targeting specific microbes without affecting other bacteria, have been proposed to deal with this problem. However, there is currently no universally applicable method to explore such foods or drugs. In this review, thirty studies on recent efforts in microbiota directed diets and medications are summarized from various databases. The methods used to find new foods and medications are primarily divided into four groups depending on the experimental models: in vivo and in vitro, as well as predictions based on bioinformatics.

37475596,Utilising the precision nutrition toolkit in the path towards precision medicine.,"The overall aim of precision nutrition is to replace the 'one size fits all' approach to dietary advice with recommendations that are more specific to the individual in order to improve the prevention or management of chronic disease. Interest in precision nutrition has grown with advancements in technologies such as genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and measurement of the gut microbiome. Precision nutrition initiatives have three major applications in precision medicine. First, they aim to provide more 'precision' dietary assessments through artificial intelligence, wearable devices or by employing omic technologies to characterise diet more precisely. Secondly, precision nutrition allows us to understand the underlying mechanisms of how diet influences disease risk and identify individuals who are more susceptible to disease due to gene-diet or microbiota-diet interactions. Third, precision nutrition can be used for 'personalised nutrition' advice where machine-learning algorithms can integrate data from omic profiles with other personal and clinical measures to improve disease risk. Proteomics and metabolomics especially provide the ability to discover new biomarkers of food or nutrient intake, proteomic or metabolomic signatures of diet and disease, and discover potential mechanisms of diet-disease interactions. Although there are several challenges that must be overcome to improve the reproducibility, cost-effectiveness and efficacy of these approaches, precision nutrition methodologies have great potential for nutrition research and clinical application.",Sawicki C; Haslam D; Bhupathiraju S,The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37475596/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37437419,The role of the Mediterranean diet in modulating the gut microbiome: A review of current evidence.,"The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is recognized as one of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization Intangible Cultural Heritage assets associated with lower rates of cardiometabolic diseases; lower prevalence of cancer, Alzheimer's disease, depression, and onset of inflammatory bowel disease; and more generally low-grade inflammation and mortality risks. Beyond being an input source of beneficial micronutrients, it recently has been discovered that the MedDiet plays a role in a more complex human microbiome-mediated mechanism. An interesting hypothesis suggests a bidirectional relationship between the MedDiet and the gut microbiome, where gut microbiota assembly and biosynthetic capacity are responsive to the diet; in return, the microbiome-reachable nutrients shape and modulate the microbiome toward a characteristic probiotic state. It can be speculated that that primary health benefits of the MedDiet exerted via the gut microbiome are mediated by the bioactive compounds transformed by the microbiome. Furthermore, it is possible that additional probiotic properties of the organisms promoted by diet adherence have secondary benefits. As more detailed omic-based studies take place, more evidence on the MedDiet as a core generic probiotic microbiome modulation strategy surface. However, individual-specific microbiome compositions might impose personal variations on the diet outcome. Therefore, a prospective strategy of a fine-tuned precision nutrition approach might deliver optimized benefits of the MedDiet.",Gundogdu A; Nalbantoglu OU,"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37437419/,1,0,0,0,0,0

As research surrounding user-centered design and the microbiome grows, movement of the spectrum of translational science from bench to bedside for improvement of human health through nutrition becomes more accessible. In this literature survey, we examined recent literature examining informatics research at the interface of nutrition and the microbiome. The objective of this survey was to synthesize recent literature describing how technology is being applied to understand health at the interface of nutrition and the microbiome focusing on the perspective of the consumer. A survey of the literature published between January 1, 2021 and October 10, 2022 was performed using the PubMed database and resulting literature was evaluated against inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 139 papers were retrieved and evaluated against inclusion and exclusion criteria. After evaluation, 45 papers were reviewed in depth revealing four major themes: (1) microbiome and diet, (2) usability,(3) reproducibility and rigor, and (4) precision medicine and precision nutrition. A review of the relationships between current literature on technology, nutrition and the microbiome, and self-management of dietary patterns was performed. Major themes that emerged from this survey revealed exciting new horizons for consumer management of diet and disease, as well as progress towards elucidating the relationship between diet, the microbiome, and health outcomes. The survey revealed continuing interest in the study of diet-related disease and the microbiome and acknowledgement of needs for data re-use, sharing, and unbiased and rigorous measurement of the microbiome. The literature also showed trends toward enhancing the usability of digital interventions to support consumer health and home management, and consensus building around how precision medicine and precision nutrition may be applied in the future to improve human health outcomes and prevent diet-related disease.",Cooper K; Clarke M; Clayton JB,Yearbook of medical informatics,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37414029/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Traditional paradigms for dietary weight management do not address biological heterogeneity between individuals and have catastrophically failed to combat the global pandemic of obesity-related diseases. Nutritional strategies that extend beyond basic weight management to instead target patient-specific pathophysiology are warranted. In this narrative review, we provide an overview of the tissue-level pathophysiological processes that drive patient heterogeneity to shape distinct cardiometabolic phenotypes in obesity. Specifically, we discuss how divergent physiology and postprandial phenotypes can reveal key metabolic defects within adipose, liver, or skeletal muscle, as well as the integrative involvement of the gut microbiome and the innate immune system. Finally, we highlight potential precision nutritional approaches to target these pathways and discuss recent translational evidence concerning the efficacy of such tailored dietary interventions for different obesity phenotypes, to optimise cardiometabolic benefits.",Shannon CE; Ní Chathail MB; Mullin SM; Meehan A; McGillicuddy FC; Roche HM,Reviews in endocrine & metabolic disorders,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37402955/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37335106,Crosstalk between dietary pomegranate and gut microbiota: evidence of health benefits.,"Gut microbiota (GM) is an invisible organ that plays an important role in human health. Increasing evidence suggests that polyphenols in pomegranate (punicalagin, PU) could serve as prebiotics to modulate the composition and function of GM. In turn, GM transform PU into bioactive metabolites such as ellagic acid (EA) and urolithin (Uro). In this review, the interplay between pomegranate and GM is thoroughly described by unveiling a dialog in which both actors seem to affect each other's roles. In a first dialog, the influence of bioactive compounds from pomegranate on GM is described. The second act shows how the GM biotransform pomegranate phenolics into Uro. Finally, the health benefits of Uro and that related molecular mechanism are summarized and discussed. Intake of pomegranate promotes beneficial bacteria in GM (e.g. <i>Lactobacillus</i> spp., <i>Bifidobacterium</i> spp.) while reducing the growth of harmful bacteria (e.g. <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i> group, <i>Clostridia</i>). <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>, and <i>Gordonibacter</i> spp., among others, biotransform PU and EA into Uro. Uro contributes to strengthening intestinal barrier and reducing inflammatory processes. Yet, Uro production varies greatly among individuals and depend on GM composition. Uro-producing bacteria and precise metabolic pathways need to be further elucidated therefore contributing to personalized and precision nutrition.",Yin Y; Martínez R; Zhang W; Estévez M,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37335106/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Optimizing Health with Nutrition-Opportunities, Gaps, and the Future.","Achieving optimal health is an aspirational goal for the population, yet the definition of health remains unclear. The role of nutrition in health has evolved beyond correcting malnutrition and specific deficiencies and has begun to focus more on achieving and maintaining 'optimal' health through nutrition. As such, the Council for Responsible Nutrition held its October 2022 Science in Session conference to advance this concept. Here, we summarize and discuss the findings of their Optimizing Health through Nutrition - Opportunities and Challenges workshop, including several gaps that need to be addressed to advance progress in the field. Defining and evaluating various indices of optimal health will require overcoming these key gaps. For example, there is a strong need to develop better biomarkers of nutrient status, including more accurate markers of food intake, as well as biomarkers of optimal health that account for maintaining resilience-the ability to recover from or respond to stressors without loss to physical and cognitive performance. In addition, there is a need to identify factors that drive individualized responses to nutrition, including genotype, metabotypes, and the gut microbiome, and to realize the opportunity of precision nutrition for optimal health.

However, while dietary sciences have been rapidly evolving to meet these challenges, validation and translation of experimental results into clinical practice remain limited for multiple reasons, including inherent ethnic, gender, and cultural interindividual variability, among other methodological, dietary reporting-related, and analytical issues. Recently, large clinical cohorts with artificial intelligence analytics have introduced new precision and personalized nutrition concepts that enable one to successfully bridge these gaps in a real-life setting.

The current management is not always able to prevent aGVHD. A neglected actor in the management of aGVHD is the gut microbiota. Gut microbiota dysbiosis after aHSCT is caused by many factors and may contribute to the development of aGVHD. Diet and nutritional status modify the gut microbiota and a wide range of products are now available to manipulate the gut microbiota (pro-, pre-, and postbiotics). New investigations are testing the effect of probiotics and nutritional supplements in both animal models and human studies, with encouraging results. In this review, we summarize the most recent literature about the probiotics and nutritional factors able to modulate the gut microbiota and we discuss the future perspective in developing new integrative therapeutic approaches to reducing the risk of graft-versus-host disease in patients undergoing aHSCT.",Lakshmanan AP; Deola S; Terranegra A,Transplantation,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37189240/,1,0,0,0,0,0

A tenet of this vision is to think in terms of precision medicine and nutrition, that is, stratification of individuals into differing groups that will have different needs across the lifespan for n-3 PUFAs. Therefore, there is a critical need to identify the sources of heterogeneity in the human population in the dietary response to n-3 PUFA intervention. We briefly review key sources of heterogeneity in the response to intake of long chain n-3 PUFAs. These include background diet, host genome, composition of the gut microbiome, and sex. We also discuss the need to integrate data from newer rodent models (e.g. population-based approaches), multi -omics, and analyses of big data using machine learning and data-driven cluster analyses. Accounting for vast heterogeneity in the human population, particularly with the use of big data integrated with preclinical evidence, will drive the next generation of precision nutrition studies and randomized clinical trials with long-chain n-3 PUFAs.",Shaikh SR; Bazinet RP,Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36943155/,1,0,0,0,0,0

However, the pendulum has swung because of our increased understanding of the importance of fibers in maintaining a health-associated microbiome. Preliminary evidence suggests that dietary fiber can alter the gut microbiome, improve IBD symptoms, balance inflammation, and enhance health-related quality of life. Therefore, it is now more vital than ever to examine how fiber could be used as a therapeutic strategy to manage and prevent disease relapse. At present, there is limited knowledge about which fibers are optimal and in what form and quantity they should be consumed to benefit patients with IBD. Additionally, individual microbiomes play a strong role in determining the outcomes and necessitate a more personalized nutritional approach to implementing dietary changes, as dietary fiber may not be as benign as once thought in a dysbiotic microbiome. This review describes dietary fibers and their mechanism of action within the microbiome, details novel fiber sources, including resistant starches and polyphenols, and concludes with potential future directions in fiber research, including the move toward precision nutrition.",Haskey N; Gold SL; Faith JJ; Raman M,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36904081/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Increasing evidence supports cross intercommunication between the intestinal microbiome and the eubiosis-dysbiosis binomial, indicating a networking role of gut bacteria as potential metabolic health surrogate markers. The abundance and diversity of the fecal microbial community are already recognized to be associated with several disorders, such as obesity, cardiometabolic events, gastrointestinal alterations, and mental diseases, which suggests that intestinal microbes may be a valuable tool as causal or as consequence biomarkers. In this context, the fecal microbiota could also be used as an adequate and informative proxy of the nutritional composition of the food intake and about the adherence to dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean or Western diets, by displaying specific fecal microbiome signatures. The aim of this review was to discuss the potential use of gut microbial composition as a putative biomarker of food intake and to screen the sensitivity value of fecal microbiota in the evaluation of dietary interventions as a reliable and precise alternative to subjective questionnaires.",Melo NCO; Cuevas-Sierra A; Fernández-Cruz E; de la O V; Martínez JA,International journal of molecular sciences,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36902349/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36678130,Gut Microbiota and Time-Restricted Feeding/Eating: A Targeted Biomarker and Approach in Precision Nutrition.,"Each individual has a unique gut microbiota; therefore, the genes in our microbiome outnumber the genes in our genome by about 150 to 1. Perturbation in host nutritional status influences gut microbiome composition and vice versa. The gut microbiome can help in producing vitamins, hormones, and other active metabolites that support the immune system; harvest energy from food; aid in digestion; protect against pathogens; improve gut transit and function; send signals to the brain and other organs; oscillate the circadian rhythm; and coordinate with the host metabolism through multiple cellular pathways. Gut microbiota can be influenced by host genetics, medications, diet, and lifestyle factors from preterm to aging. Aligning with precision nutrition, identifying a personalized microbiome mandates the provision of the right nutrients at the right time to the right patient. Thus, before prescribing a personalized treatment, it is crucial to monitor and count the gut flora as a focused biomarker. Many nutritional approaches that have been developed help in maintaining and restoring an optimal microbiome such as specific diet therapy, nutrition interventions, and customized eating patterns. One of these approaches is time-restricted feeding/eating (TRF/E), a type of intermittent fasting (IF) in which a subject abstains from food intake for a specific time window. Such a dietary modification might alter and restore the gut microbiome for proper alignment of cellular and molecular pathways throughout the lifespan. In this review, we have highlighted that the gut microbiota would be a targeted biomarker and TRF/E would be a targeted approach for restoring the gut-microbiome-associated molecular pathways such as hormonal signaling, the circadian system, metabolic regulators, neural responses, and immune-inflammatory pathways. Consequently, modulation of the gut microbiota through TRF/E could contribute to proper utilization and availability of the nutrients and in this way confer protection against diseases for harnessing personalized nutrition approaches to improve human health.",Zeb F; Osaili T; Obaid RS; Naja F; Radwan H; Cheikh Ismail L; Hasan H; Hashim M; Alam I; Sehar B; Faris ME,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36678130/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36660362,Personalized Dietary Regimens for Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Current Knowledge and Future Perspectives.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic and incurable conditions of the gastro-intestinal tract with an increasing incidence and prevalence worldwide. Common symptoms are abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. Despite recent advances in medical management, many patients fail to achieve clinical remission and healing of the mucosa of the bowel. The cause is thought to involve an inappropriate reaction of the immune system, the microbiome and the environment in genetically susceptible individuals, leading to chronic bowel inflammation. Evidence is emerging that diet is a key environmental factor that might influence disease onset and course, and therefore may become a therapeutic strategy to mitigate inflammation and symptoms. Since IBD is a heterogeneous disease on a clinical and a molecular level, personalizing dietary advice could be the crucial factor to achieve long-lasting changes in dietary behaviors that could not only improve nutritional status but also tackle gut inflammation and abdominal symptoms on an individual level. In this review, we first discuss different aspects of personalized nutrition, namely the level, focus, and scope of personalized dietary regimens. Then, we provide a framework for the different goals of nutritional therapy in IBD and current evidence for personalized dietary approaches. Lastly, we discuss the need for adequate trial designs, access to the right data types and the bioinformatic tools that are necessary to develop algorithms that will allow us to move from general ""healthy eating"" advice to truly personalized nutritional plans for the individual IBD patient.",Wellens J; Vissers E; Matthys C; Vermeire S; Sabino J,Pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36660362/,1,0,0,0,0,0

36446139,Predicting Personalized Responses to Dietary Fiber Interventions: Opportunities for Modulation of the Gut Microbiome to Improve Health.,"Inadequate dietary fiber consumption has become common across industrialized nations, accompanied by changes in gut microbial composition and a dramatic increase in chronic metabolic diseases. The human gut microbiome harbors genes that are required for the digestion of fiber, resulting in the production of end products that mediate gastrointestinal and systemic benefits to the host. Thus, the use of fiber interventions has attracted increasing interest as a strategy to modulate the gut microbiome and improve human health. However, considerable interindividual differences in gut microbial composition have resulted in variable responses toward fiber interventions. This variability has led to observed nonresponder individuals and highlights the need for personalized approaches to effectively redirect the gut ecosystem. In this review, we summarize strategies used to address the responder and nonresponder phenomenon in dietary fiber interventions and propose a targeted approach to identify predictive features based on knowledge of fiber metabolism and machine learning approaches.",Kok CR; Rose D; Hutkins R,Annual review of food science and technology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36446139/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36427956,Interactions between the gut microbiome and ketogenic diet in refractory epilepsy.,"Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases globally, afflicting approximately 50 million people worldwide. While many antiepileptic drugs exist, an estimated one-third of individuals do not respond to available medications. The high fat, low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD) has been used to treat refractory epilepsy in cases when existing antiepileptic drugs fail. However, there are many variations of the KD, each of which varies greatly in its efficacy and side effects. Increasing evidence suggests that interactions between the KD and gut microbiome may modulate the effects of the diet on host physiology. Herein, we review existing evidence of microbiome differences in epileptic individuals compared to healthy controls. We highlight in particular both clinical and animal studies revealing effects of the KD on the composition and function of the microbiome, as well as proof-of-concept animal studies that implicate the microbiome in the antiseizure effects of the KD. We further synthesize findings suggesting that variations in clinical KD formulations may differentially influence host physiology and discuss the gut microbial interactions with specific dietary factors that may play a role. Overall, understanding interactions between the gut microbiota and specific nutritional components of clinical KDs could reveal foundational mechanisms that underlie the effectiveness, variability, and side effects of different KDs, with the potential to lead to precision nutritional and microbiome-based approaches to treat refractory epilepsy.",Özcan E; Lum GR; Hsiao EY,International review of neurobiology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36427956/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36198381,Meta-analysis of fecal viromes demonstrates high diagnostic potential of the gut viral signatures for colorectal cancer and adenoma risk assessment.,"Viruses have been reported as inducers of tumorigenesis. Little studies have explored the impact of the gut virome on the progression of colorectal cancer. However, there is still a problem with the repeatability of viral signatures across multiple cohorts. The present study aimed to reveal the repeatable gut vial signatures of colorectal cancer and adenoma patients and decipher the potential of viral markers in disease risk assessment for diagnosis. 1,282 available fecal metagenomes from 9 published studies for colorectal cancer and adenoma were collected. A gut viral catalog was constructed via a reference-independent approach. Viral signatures were identified by cross-cohort meta-analysis and used to build predictive models based on machine learning algorithms. New fecal samples were collected to validate the generalization of predictive models. The gut viral composition of colorectal cancer patients was drastically altered compared with healthy, as evidenced by changes in some Siphoviridae and Myoviridae viruses and enrichment of Microviridae, whereas the virome variation in adenoma patients was relatively low. Cross-cohort meta-analysis identified 405 differential viruses for colorectal cancer, including several phages of Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, and Hungatella that were enriched in patients and some control-enriched Ruminococcaceae phages. In 9 discovery cohorts, the optimal risk assessment model obtained an average cross-cohort area under the curve of 0.830 for discriminating colorectal cancer patients from controls. This model also showed consistently high accuracy in 2 independent validation cohorts (optimal area under the curve, 0.906). Gut virome analysis of adenoma patients identified 88 differential viruses and achieved an optimal area under the curve of 0.772 for discriminating patients from controls. Our findings demonstrate the gut virome characteristics in colorectal cancer and adenoma and highlight gut virus-bacterial synergy in the progression of colorectal cancer. The gut viral signatures may be new targets for colorectal cancer treatment. In addition, high repeatability and predictive power of the prediction models suggest the potential of gut viral biomarkers in non-invasive diagnostic tests of colorectal cancer and adenoma.",Chen F; Li S; Guo R; Song F; Zhang Y; Wang X; Huo X; Lv Q; Ullah H; Wang G; Ma Y; Yan Q; Ma X,Journal of advanced research,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36198381/,0,0,0,1,0,0

Thus, in the review, we aimed to discuss the current facts, evidence, and controversy about the role of A. muciniphila in the pathophysiology of HTN and its potential effect on HTN management/regulation, which could be beneficial in identifying the drug target for the management of HTN.",Lakshmanan AP; Murugesan S; Al Khodor S; Terranegra A,Journal of translational medicine,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36153618/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36125787,Precision Nutrition: Recent Advances in Obesity.,"""Precision nutrition"" is an emerging area of nutrition research that focuses on understanding metabolic variability within and between individuals and helps develop customized dietary plans and interventions to maintain optimal individual health. It encompasses nutritional genomic (gene-nutrient interactions), epigenetic, microbiome, and environmental factors. Obesity is a complex disease that is affected by genetic and environmental factors and thus a relevant target of precision nutrition-based approaches. Recent studies have shown significant associations between obesity phenotypes (body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, and central and regional adiposity) and genetic variants, epigenetic factors (DNA methylation and noncoding RNA), microbial species, and environment (sociodemographics and physical activity). Additionally, studies have also shown that the interactions between genetic variants, microbial metabolites, and epigenetic factors affect energy balance and adiposity. These include variants in <i>FTO, MC4R, PPAR</i>, <i>APOA</i>, and <i>FADS</i> genes, DNA methylation in CpG island regions, and specific miRNAs and microbial species such as <i>Firmicutes</i>, <i>Bacteriodes</i>, <i>Clostridiales,</i> etc. Similarly, studies have shown that microbial metabolites, folate, B-vitamins, and short-chain fatty acids interact with miRNAs to influence obesity phenotypes. With the advent of next-generation sequencing and analytical approaches, the advances in precision nutrition have the potential to lead to new paradigms, which can further lead to interventions or customized treatments specific to individuals or susceptible groups of individuals. This review highlights the recent advances in precision nutrition as applied to obesity and projects the importance of precision nutrition in obesity and weight management.",Voruganti VS,"Physiology (Bethesda, Md.)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36125787/,1,0,0,0,0,0

PN can help answer the question ""What should I eat to be healthy?"", recognizing that what is healthful for one individual may not be the same for another, and understanding that health and responses to diet change over time. The growth of the PN market has been driven by increasing consumer interest in individualized products and services coupled with advances in technology, analytics, and omic sciences. However, important concerns are evident regarding the adequacy of scientific substantiation supporting claims for current products and services. An additional limitation to accessing PN is the current cost of diagnostic tests and wearable devices. Despite these challenges, PN holds great promise as a tool to improve healthspan and reduce healthcare costs. Accelerating advancement in PN will require: (a) investment in multidisciplinary collaborations to enable the development of user-friendly tools applying technological advances in omics, sensors, artificial intelligence, big data management, and analytics; (b) engagement of healthcare professionals and payers to support equitable and broader adoption of PN as medicine shifts toward preventive and personalized approaches; and (c) system-wide collaboration between stakeholders to advocate for continued support for evidence-based PN, develop a regulatory framework to maintain consumer trust and engagement, and allow PN to reach its full potential.",Berciano S; Figueiredo J; Brisbois TD; Alford S; Koecher K; Eckhouse S; Ciati R; Kussmann M; Ordovas JM; Stebbins K; Blumberg JB,Frontiers in nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36118748/,1,0,0,0,0,0

This review describes the state of the art, limitations, and challenges towards the application of traditional and omics-based technology to study the Jiuqu microbiome and highlights the need for integrating meta-omics data. In addition, we review the varieties of Jiuqu and their production processes, with particular attention to factors shaping the microbiota of Jiuqu. Then, the potentials of integrated omics approaches used in Jiuqu research are examined in order to understand the assembly of the microbiome and improve the quality of the products. A variety of different approaches, including molecular and mass spectrometry-based techniques, have led to scientific advances in the analysis of the complex ecosystem of Jiuqu. To date, the extensive research on Jiuqu has mainly focused on the microbial community diversity, flavor profiles, and biochemical characteristics. An integrative approach to large-scale omics datasets and cultivated microbiota has great potential for understanding the interrelation of the Jiuqu microbiome. Further research on the Jiuqu microbiome may explain the inherent property of compositional stability and stable performance of a complex microbiota coping with environmental perturbations and provide important insights to reconstruct synthetic microbiota and develop modern intelligent manufacturing procedures for Jiuqu.",Kang J; Xue Y; Chen X; Han BZ,Comprehensive reviews in food science and food safety,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36038529/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36026526,The human gut microbiota and glucose metabolism: a scoping review of key bacteria and the potential role of SCFAs.,"The gut microbiota plays a fundamental role in human nutrition and metabolism and may have direct implications for type 2 diabetes and associated preconditions. An improved understanding of relations between human gut microbiota and glucose metabolism could lead to novel opportunities for type 2 diabetes prevention, but human observational studies reporting on such findings have not been extensively reviewed. Here, we review the literature on associations between gut microbiota and markers and stages of glucose dysregulation and insulin resistance in healthy adults and in adults with metabolic disease and risk factors. We present the current evidence for identified key bacteria and their potential roles in glucose metabolism independent of overweight, obesity, and metabolic drugs. We provide support for SCFAs mediating such effects and discuss the role of diet, as well as metabolites derived from diet and gut microbiota interactions. From 5983 initially identified PubMed records, 45 original studies were eligible and reviewed. α Diversity and 45 bacterial taxa were associated with selected outcomes. Six taxa were most frequently associated with glucose metabolism: Akkermansia muciniphila, Bifidobacterium longum, Clostridium leptum group, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Faecalibacterium (inversely associated) and Dorea (directly associated). For Dorea and A. muciniphila, associations were independent of metabolic drugs and body measures. For A. muciniphila and F. prausnitzii, limited evidence supported SCFA mediation of potential effects on glucose metabolism. We conclude that observational studies applying metagenomics sequencing to identify species-level relations are warranted, as are studies accounting for confounding factors and investigating SCFA and postprandial glucose metabolism. Such advances in the field will, together with mechanistic and prospective studies and investigations into diet-gut microbiota interactions, have the potential to bring critical insight into roles of gut microbiota and microbial metabolites in human glucose metabolism and to contribute toward the development of novel prevention strategies for type 2 diabetes, including precision nutrition.",Palmnäs-Bédard MSA; Costabile G; Vetrani C; Åberg S; Hjalmarsson Y; Dicksved J; Riccardi G; Landberg R,The American journal of clinical nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36026526/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35785484,Nutrition for precision health: The time is now.,"Precision nutrition has emerged as a boiling area of nutrition research, with a particular focus on revealing the individual variability in response to diets that is determined mainly by the complex interactions of dietary factors with the multi-tiered ""omics"" makeups. Reproducible findings from the observational studies and diet intervention trials have lent preliminary but consistent evidence to support the fundamental role of gene-diet interactions in determining the individual variability in health outcomes including obesity and weight loss. Recent investigations suggest that the abundance and diversity of the gut microbiome may also modify the dietary effects; however, considerable instability in the results from the microbiome research has been noted. In addition, growing studies suggest that a complicated multiomics algorithm would be developed by incorporating the genome, epigenome, metabolome, proteome, and microbiome in predicting the individual variability in response to diets. Moreover, precision nutrition would also scrutinize the role of biological (circadian) rhythm in determining the individual variability of dietary effects. The evidence gathered from precision nutrition research will be the basis for constructing precision health dietary recommendations, which hold great promise to help individuals and their health care providers create precise and effective diet plans for precision health in the future.",Qi L,"Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35785484/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35679067,Role of Ketogenic Diets in Multiple Sclerosis and Related Animal Models: An Updated Review.,"Prescribing a ketogenic diet (KD) is a century-old dietary intervention mainly used in the context of intractable epilepsy. The classic KD and its variants regained popularity in recent decades, and they are considered potentially beneficial in a variety of neurological conditions other than epilepsy. Many patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have attempted diet modification for better control of their disease, although evidence thus far remains insufficient to recommend a specific diet for these patients. The results of 3 pilot clinical trials of KD therapy for MS, as well as several related studies, have been reported in recent years. The preliminary findings suggest that KD is safe, feasible, and potentially neuroprotective and disease-modifying for patients with MS. Research on corresponding rodent models has also lent support to the efficacy of KD in the prevention and treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and toxin-induced inflammatory demyelinating conditions in the brain. Furthermore, the animal studies have yielded mechanistic insights into the molecular mechanisms of KD action in relevant situations, paving the way for precision nutrition. Herein we review and synthesize recent advances and also identify unresolved issues, such as the roles of adipokines and gut microbiota, in this field. Hopefully this panoramic view of current understanding can inform future research directions and clinical practice with regard to KD in MS and related conditions.",Lin WS; Lin SJ; Liao PY; Suresh D; Hsu TR; Wang PY,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35679067/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35565885,Personalized Nutrition in the Management of Female Infertility: New Insights on Chronic Low-Grade Inflammation.,"Increasing evidence on the significance of nutrition in reproduction is emerging from both animal and human studies, suggesting a mutual association between nutrition and female fertility. Different ""fertile"" dietary patterns have been studied; however, in humans, conflicting results or weak correlations are often reported, probably because of the individual variations in genome, proteome, metabolome, and microbiome and the extent of exposure to different environmental conditions. In this scenario, ""precision nutrition"", namely personalized dietary patterns based on deep phenotyping and on metabolomics, microbiome, and nutrigenetics of each case, might be more efficient for infertile patients than applying a generic nutritional approach. In this review, we report on new insights into the nutritional management of infertile patients, discussing the main nutrigenetic, nutrigenomic, and microbiomic aspects that should be investigated to achieve effective personalized nutritional interventions. Specifically, we will focus on the management of low-grade chronic inflammation, which is associated with several infertility-related diseases.",Fabozzi G; Verdone G; Allori M; Cimadomo D; Tatone C; Stuppia L; Franzago M; Ubaldi N; Vaiarelli A; Ubaldi FM; Rienzi L; Gennarelli G,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35565885/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35500546,Diet-microbiome interactions in cancer treatment: Opportunities and challenges for precision nutrition in cancer.,"Dietary patterns contribute to cancer risk. Separately, microbial factors influence the development of several cancers. However, the interaction of diet and the microbiome and their joint contribution to cancer treatment response needs more research. The microbiome significantly impacts drug metabolism, immune activation, and response to immunotherapy. One of the critical factors affecting the microbiome structure and function is diet. Data demonstrate that the diet and microbiome composition affects the immune response. Moreover, malnutrition is a significant confounder to cancer therapy response. There is little understanding of the interaction of malnutrition with the microbiome in the context of cancer. This review aims to address the current knowledge of dietary intake patterns and malnutrition among cancer patients and the impact on treatment outcomes. Second, this review will provide evidence linking the microbiome to cancer treatment response and provide evidence of the potentially strong effect that diet could have on this interaction. This review will formulate critical questions that will need further research to understand the diet-microbiome relationship in cancer treatment response and directions for future research to guide us to precision nutrition therapy to improve cancer outcomes.",Greathouse KL; Wyatt M; Johnson AJ; Toy EP; Khan JM; Dunn K; Clegg DJ; Reddy S,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35500546/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35455649,Epigenetics in Precision Nutrition.,"Precision nutrition is an emerging area of nutrition research, with primary focus on the individual variability in response to dietary and lifestyle factors, which are mainly determined by an individual's intrinsic variations, such as those in genome, epigenome, and gut microbiome. The current research on precision nutrition is heavily focused on genome and gut microbiome, while epigenome (DNA methylation, non-coding RNAs, and histone modification) is largely neglected. The epigenome acts as the interface between the human genome and environmental stressors, including diets and lifestyle. Increasing evidence has suggested that epigenetic modifications, particularly DNA methylation, may determine the individual variability in metabolic health and response to dietary and lifestyle factors and, therefore, hold great promise in discovering novel markers for precision nutrition and potential targets for precision interventions. This review summarized recent studies on DNA methylation with obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, with more emphasis put in the relations of DNA methylation with nutrition and diet/lifestyle interventions. We also briefly reviewed other epigenetic events, such as non-coding RNAs, in relation to human health and nutrition, and discussed the potential role of epigenetics in the precision nutrition research.",Li X; Qi L,Journal of personalized medicine,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35455649/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35328587,Usefulness of Probiotics in the Management of NAFLD: Evidence and Involved Mechanisms of Action from Preclinical and Human Models.,"The present review aims at analyzing the current evidence regarding probiotic administration for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) management. Additionally, the involved mechanisms of action modulated by probiotic administration, as well as the eventual limitations of this therapeutic approach and potential alternatives, are discussed. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that the administration of single-strain probiotics and probiotic mixtures effectively prevents diet-induced NAFLD. In both cases, the magnitude of the described effects, as well as the involved mechanisms of action, are comparable, including reduced liver lipid accumulation (due to lipogenesis downregulation and fatty acid oxidation upregulation), recovery of gut microbiota composition and enhanced intestinal integrity. Similar results have also been reported in clinical trials, where the administration of probiotics proved to be effective in the treatment of NAFLD in patients featuring this liver condition. In this case, information regarding the mechanisms of action underlying probiotics-mediated hepatoprotective effects is scarcer (mainly due to the difficulty of liver sample collection). Since probiotics administration represents an increased risk of infection in vulnerable subjects, much attention has been paid to parabiotics and postbiotics, which seem to be effective in the management of several metabolic diseases, and thus represent a suitable alternative to probiotic usage.",Arellano-García L; Portillo MP; Martínez JA; Milton-Laskibar I,International journal of molecular sciences,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35328587/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35243943,Understanding the mechanism underlying the anti-diabetic effect of dietary component: a focus on gut microbiota.,"Diabetes has become one of the biggest non-communicable diseases and threatens human health worldwide. The management of diabetes is a complex and multifaceted process including drug therapy and lifestyle interventions. Dietary components are essential for both diabetes management and health and survival of trillions of the gut microbiota (GM). Herein, we will discuss the relationship between diets and GM, the mechanism linking diabetes and gut dysbiosis, and the effects of dietary components (nutrients, phytochemicals, probiotics, food additives, etc.) on diabetes from the perspective of modulating GM. The GM of diabetic patients differs from that of health individuals and GM disorder contributes to the onset and maintenance of diabetes. Studies in humans and animal models consolidate that dietary component is a key regulator of diabetes and increasing evidence suggests that the alteration of GM plays a salient role in dietary interventions for diabetes. Given that diabetes is a major public health issue, especially that diabetes is linked with a high risk of mortality from COVID-19, this review provides compelling evidence for that targeting GM by dietary components is a promising strategy, and offers new insights into potential preventive or therapeutic approaches (dietary and pharmacological intervention) for the clinical management of diabetes.",Zhao Y; Li M; Wang Y; Geng R; Fang J; Liu Q; Kang SG; Zeng WC; Huang K; Tong T,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35243943/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35179102,A novel bioactive postbiotics: from microbiota-derived extracellular nanoparticles to health promoting.,"In recent years, the emerging concern regarding safety issues associated with live bacterial cells is enhancing the interest in using cell components and metabolites derived from microbiota. Therefore, the term ""postbiotics"" is increasingly found in food microbiology, food scientific and commercial products. Postbiotics is defined as non-viable microorganisms or their components that provide benefits to the host. Many in vivo and in vitro experiments have shown that beneficial microbiota-generated extracellular nanoparticles (NPs) confer unique health promoting functions to the intestinal local and systemic effects, which can be considered as a novel postbiotics. Meanwhile, the postbiotics-NPs is a protective complex, delivering bioactive components to reach distant tissues and organs at high concentrations. These properties demonstrate that postbiotics-NPs may contribute to the improvement of host health by regulating specific gut microbiota and physiological functions, while the exact mechanisms are not fully elucidated. This review highlights the current understanding of postbiotics-NPs functional properties and mechanisms of health benefits, especially focusing on the interactions in gut microbiota and host, functions in human health and potential applications in future functional food and biomedical fields.",Gu Z; Meng S; Wang Y; Lyu B; Li P; Shang N,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35179102/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35135841,Dietary macronutrients and the gut microbiome: a precision nutrition approach to improve cardiometabolic health.,"Accumulating evidence indicates that the gut microbiome is an important regulator of body weight, glucose and lipid metabolism, and inflammatory processes, and may thereby play a key role in the aetiology of obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Interindividual responsiveness to specific dietary interventions may be partially determined by differences in baseline gut microbiota composition and functionality between individuals with distinct metabolic phenotypes. However, the relationship between an individual's diet, gut microbiome and host metabolic phenotype is multidirectional and complex, yielding a challenge for practical implementation of targeted dietary guidelines. In this review, we discuss the latest research describing interactions between dietary composition, the gut microbiome and host metabolism. Furthermore, we describe how this knowledge can be integrated to develop precision-based nutritional strategies to improve bodyweight control and metabolic health in humans. Specifically, we will address that (1) insight in the role of the baseline gut microbial and metabolic phenotype in dietary intervention response may provide leads for precision-based nutritional strategies; that (2) the balance between carbohydrate and protein fermentation by the gut microbiota, as well as the site of fermentation in the colon, seems important determinants of host metabolism; and that (3) 'big data', including multiple omics and advanced modelling, are of undeniable importance in predicting (non-)response to dietary interventions. Clearly, detailed metabolic and microbial phenotyping in humans is necessary to better understand the link between diet, the gut microbiome and host metabolism, which is required to develop targeted dietary strategies and guidelines for different subgroups of the population.",Jardon KM; Canfora EE; Goossens GH; Blaak EE,Gut,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35135841/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We review recent epidemiological studies that have improved the characterization of the food exposome and brain health in humans and have revealed promising nutrition-based strategies to prevent cognitive aging. A selection of epidemiological research from the past 18 months of both observational and clinical studies is presented, with a focus on novel findings, including novel nutrient and diet patterns, diet-related approaches to rescue brain energetics defects in aging, and biomarker-based studies to decipher specific neurobiological pathways of nutrition and brain health. Although healthy diets such as the Mediterranean diet promote brain health throughout life, specific diets, such as the Mediterranean-Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay diet, or specific nutrients (LC n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, carotenoids, vitamin D, B vitamins, polyphenols) alone or in combination, may prevent cognitive aging. Diet management approaches to rescue brain energetics defects such as the Modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet may be promising to prevent neurodegenerative diseases. Expanding research also suggests that promotion of a healthy gut microbiome through prebiotic foods may preserve the diet-gut-brain axis with aging.

34801688,"Are eggs good again? A precision nutrition perspective on the effects of eggs on cardiovascular risk, taking into account plasma lipid profiles and TMAO.","Although eggs are a nutrient dense food delivering high quality protein and micronutrients, given that eggs are also rich in cholesterol and choline, whether egg intake is contraindicated for individuals at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains controversial. In this mini review, we provide a Precision Nutrition perspective, highlighting the importance of two factors: the effect of egg cholesterol on plasma cholesterol concentrations in most people and in cholesterol hyper-absorbers, and the effect of egg choline on plasma concentrations of trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a microbe-host co-metabolite independently associated with increased CVD risk. We discuss recent evidence from intervention studies showing that in most individuals egg intake does not have a deleterious effect on plasma lipid profiles, but also highlight that some individuals are cholesterol hyper-absorbers or individuals who are not able to maintain cholesterol homeostasis by suppressing endogenous cholesterol synthesis, and that for these individuals the intake of eggs and other dietary sources of cholesterol would be contraindicated. We also discuss the complex relationship between dietary sources of choline vs. phosphatidylcholine, the gut microbiome, and plasma TMAO concentrations, highlighting the high inter-individual variability in TMAO production and gut microbiome profiles among healthy individuals and those with metabolic conditions. Precision Nutrition approaches that allow the clinician to stratify risk and improve dietary recommendations for individual patients are desirable for improving patient compliance and health outcomes. More clinical studies are needed to determine how to identify individuals at risk for CVD for whom egg intake is contraindicated vs. those for whom egg intake is not associated with negative effects on plasma lipid profiles nor plasma TMAO concentrations.",Kang JW; Zivkovic AM,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34801688/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34757699,Personalized nutrition for dementia prevention.,"The role of nutrition has been investigated for decades under the assumption of one-size-fits-all. Yet there is heterogeneity in metabolic and neurobiological responses to diet. Thus a more personalized approach may better fit biological reality and have increased efficacy to prevent dementia. Personalized nutrition builds on the food exposome, defined as the history of diet-related exposures over the lifetime, and on its interactions with the genome and other biological characteristics (eg, metabolism, the microbiome) to shape health. We review current advances of personalized nutrition in dementia research. We discuss key questions, success milestones, and future roadmap from observational epidemiology to clinical studies through basic science.

34422879,Memorable Food: Fighting Age-Related Neurodegeneration by Precision Nutrition.,"Healthcare systems worldwide are seriously challenged by a rising prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), which mostly, but not exclusively, affect the ever-growing population of the elderly. The most known neurodegenerative diseases are Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but some viral infections of the brain and traumatic brain injury may also cause NDD. Typical for NDD are the malfunctioning of neurons and their irreversible loss, which often progress irreversibly to dementia and ultimately to death. Numerous factors are involved in the pathogenesis of NDD: genetic variability, epigenetic changes, extent of oxidative/nitrosative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and DNA damage. The complex interplay of all the above-mentioned factors may be a fingerprint of neurodegeneration, with different diseases being affected to different extents by particular factors. There is a voluminous body of evidence showing the benefits of regular exercise to brain health and cognitive functions. Moreover, the importance of a healthy diet, balanced in macro- and micro-nutrients, in preventing neurodegeneration and slowing down a progression to full-blown disease is evident. Individuals affected by NDD almost inevitably have low-grade inflammation and anomalies in lipid metabolism. Metabolic and lipid profiles in NDD can be improved by the Mediterranean diet. Many studies have associated the Mediterranean diet with a decreased risk of dementia and AD, but a cause-and-effect relationship has not been deduced. Studies with caloric restriction showed neuroprotective effects in animal models, but the results in humans are inconsistent. The pathologies of NDD are complex and there is a great inter-individual (epi)genetic variance within any population. Furthermore, the gut microbiome, being deeply involved in nutrient uptake and lipid metabolism, also represents a pillar of the gut microbiome-brain axis and is linked with the pathogenesis of NDD. Numerous studies on the role of different micronutrients (omega-3 fatty acids, bioactive polyphenols from fruit and medicinal plants) in the prevention, prediction, and treatment of NDD have been conducted, but we are still far away from a personalized diet plan for individual NDD patients. For this to be realized, large-scale cohorts that would include the precise monitoring of food intake, mapping of genetic variants, epigenetic data, microbiome studies, and metabolome, lipidome, and transcriptome data are needed.",Milošević M; Arsić A; Cvetković Z; Vučić V,Frontiers in nutrition,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34422879/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34360695,The Mechanism of Secretion and Metabolism of Gut-Derived 5-Hydroxytryptamine.,"Serotonin, also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), is a metabolite of tryptophan and is reported to modulate the development and neurogenesis of the enteric nervous system, gut motility, secretion, inflammation, sensation, and epithelial development. Approximately 95% of 5-HT in the body is synthesized and secreted by enterochromaffin (EC) cells, the most common type of neuroendocrine cells in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, through sensing signals from the intestinal lumen and the circulatory system. Gut microbiota, nutrients, and hormones are the main factors that play a vital role in regulating 5-HT secretion by EC cells. Apart from being an important neurotransmitter and a paracrine signaling molecule in the gut, gut-derived 5-HT was also shown to exert other biological functions (in autism and depression) far beyond the gut. Moreover, studies conducted on the regulation of 5-HT in the immune system demonstrated that 5-HT exerts anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory effects on the gut by binding to different receptors under intestinal inflammatory conditions. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms through which 5-HT participates in cell metabolism and physiology can provide potential therapeutic strategies for treating intestinal diseases. Herein, we review recent evidence to recapitulate the mechanisms of synthesis, secretion, regulation, and biofunction of 5-HT to improve the nutrition and health of humans.",Liu N; Sun S; Wang P; Sun Y; Hu Q; Wang X,International journal of molecular sciences,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34360695/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34277527,Towards Tailored Gut Microbiome-Based and Dietary Interventions for Promoting the Development and Maintenance of a Healthy Brain.,"Mental health is determined by a complex interplay between the Neurological Exposome and the Human Genome. Multiple genetic and non-genetic (exposome) factors interact early in life, modulating the risk of developing the most common complex neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), with potential long-term consequences on health. To date, the understating of the precise etiology underpinning these neurological alterations, and their clinical management pose a challenge. The crucial role played by diet and gut microbiota in brain development and functioning would indicate that modulating the gut-brain axis may help protect against the onset and progression of mental-health disorders. Some nutritional deficiencies and gut microbiota alterations have been linked to NDDs, suggesting their potential pathogenic implications. In addition, certain dietary interventions have emerged as promising alternatives or adjuvant strategies for improving the management of particular NDDs, at least in particular subsets of subjects. The gut microbiota can be a key to mediating the effects of other exposome factors such as diet on mental health, and ongoing research in Psychiatry and Neuropediatrics is developing Precision Nutrition Models to classify subjects according to a diet response prediction based on specific individual features, including microbiome signatures. Here, we review current scientific evidence for the impact of early life environmental factors, including diet, on gut microbiota and neuro-development, emphasizing the potential long-term consequences on health; and also summarize the state of the art regarding the mechanisms underlying diet and gut microbiota influence on the brain-gut axis. Furthermore, we describe the evidence supporting the key role played by gut microbiota, diet and nutrition in neurodevelopment, as well as the effectiveness of certain dietary and microbiome-based interventions aimed at preventing or treating NDDs. Finally, we emphasize the need for further research to gain greater insight into the complex interplay between diet, gut microbiome and brain development.

34274490,Dietary rational targeting of redox-regulated genes.,"Nutrigenomics is the study of how food and associated nutrients affect gene expression. This field sits at the intersection of diet, the genome and health with the ultimate goal of exploiting its understanding to design a precision nutrition strategy for humans. We have studied diet and nutrigenomics in the context of something we call ""dietary rational gene targeting."" Here, healthy diet is used to alter disease-causing gene expression back toward the normal to treat various diseases and conditions while lowering treatment cost and toxicity. In this paper, we discuss the use of this strategy to modulate the expression of redox-associated genes to improve human health. Most human disorders are associated, at least to some extent, with oxidative stress and so treatments (including diet) that target redox-related genes have major potential clinical significance. Healthy dietary options here are wide-ranging and include whole foods and botanical-based beverages. In some cases, botanical supplements may also be useful gene modulators although their health benefits are less clear. Key redox gene targets for these dietary agents include antioxidant genes, related transcription factors, detoxification genes, and DNA repair genes. Other important considerations include bioavailability, the contribution of the microbiome, and advancing technologies. In this review, specific examples of redox associated genes and pathologies and their potential treatment with healthy diet are presented to illustrate our approach. This will also serve as a foundation for the design of future clinical studies to improve diet-related health.",Bagyi J; Sripada V; Aidone AM; Lin HY; Ruder EH; Crawford DR,Free radical biology & medicine,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34274490/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Almonds are a higher energy-dense (ED) food that acts like a lower ED food when consumed. Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses of nut RCTs showed that almonds were the only nut that had a small but significant decrease in both mean body mass and fat mass, compared to control diets. The biological mechanisms for almond weight control include enhanced displacement of other foods, decreased macronutrient bioavailability for a lower net metabolizable energy (ME), upregulation of acute signals for reduced hunger, and elevated satiety and increased resting energy expenditure. The intake of 42.5 g/day of almonds significantly lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), 10-year Framingham estimated coronary heart disease (CHD) risk and associated cardiovascular disease (CVD) medical expenditures. Diastolic blood pressure (BP) was modestly but significantly lowered when almonds were consumed at >42.5 g/day or for >6 weeks. Recent RCTs suggest possible emerging health benefits for almonds such as enhanced cognitive performance, improved heart rate variability under mental stress, and reduced rate of facial skin aging from exposure to ultraviolet (UV) B radiation. Eight RCTs show that almonds can support colonic microbiota health by promoting microflora richness and diversity, increasing the ratio of symbiotic to pathogenic microflora, and concentrations of health-promoting colonic bioactives.

34062869,Diet-Microbiota Interactions in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. Although the precise etiology of IBD is largely unknown, it is widely thought that diet contributes to the development of IBD. Diet shapes the composition of the gut microbiota, which plays critical roles in intestinal homeostasis. In contrast, intestinal inflammation induces gut dysbiosis and may affect the use of dietary nutrients by host cells and the gut microbiota. The interaction of diet and the gut microbiota is perturbed in patients with IBD. Herein, we review the current knowledge of diet and gut microbiota interaction in intestinal homeostasis. We also discuss alterations of diet and gut microbiota interaction that influence the outcome and the nutritional treatment of IBD. Understanding the complex relationships between diet and the gut microbiota provides crucial insight into the pathogenesis of IBD and advances the development of new therapeutic approaches.",Sugihara K; Kamada N,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34062869/,1,0,0,0,0,0

33880901,Nutri-epigenetics: the effect of maternal diet and early nutrition on the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.,"Autoimmune diseases comprise a wide group of diseases involving a self-response of the immune system against the host. The etiopathogenesis is very complex involving disease-specific factors but also environmental factors, among which the diet. Maternal diet during pregnancy as well as early nutrition recently attracted the interest of the scientists as contributing to the immune programming. In this paper, we reviewed the most recent literature on the effect of maternal diet and early nutrition in modulating the immune system in a selected subset of autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Particularly, we focused our narrative on the role of maternal and perinatal nutrition in the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the auto-immune response. Maternal diet during pregnancy as well as breastfeeding and early nutrition play a big role in many epigenetic mechanisms. Most of the nutrients consumed by the mother and the infant are known exerting epigenetic functions, such as folate, methionine, zinc, vitamins B12 and D, fibers, casein and gliadin, and they were linked to gene expression changes in the immune pathways. Despite the common role of maternal diet, breastfeeding and early nutrition in almost all the autoimmune diseases, each disease seems to have specific diet-driver epigenetic mechanisms that require further investigations. The research in this field is opening new routes to establishing a precision nutrition approach to the auto-immune diseases.",Bangarusamy DK; Lakshmanan AP; Al-Zaidan S; Alabduljabbar S; Terranegra A,Minerva pediatrics,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33880901/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33737920,"Applications of Machine Learning in Human Microbiome Studies: A Review on Feature Selection, Biomarker Identification, Disease Prediction and Treatment.","The number of microbiome-related studies has notably increased the availability of data on human microbiome composition and function. These studies provide the essential material to deeply explore host-microbiome associations and their relation to the development and progression of various complex diseases. Improved data-analytical tools are needed to exploit all information from these biological datasets, taking into account the peculiarities of microbiome data, i.e., compositional, heterogeneous and sparse nature of these datasets. The possibility of predicting host-phenotypes based on taxonomy-informed feature selection to establish an association between microbiome and predict disease states is beneficial for personalized medicine. In this regard, machine learning (ML) provides new insights into the development of models that can be used to predict outputs, such as classification and prediction in microbiology, infer host phenotypes to predict diseases and use microbial communities to stratify patients by their characterization of state-specific microbial signatures. Here we review the state-of-the-art ML methods and respective software applied in human microbiome studies, performed as part of the COST Action ML4Microbiome activities. This scoping review focuses on the application of ML in microbiome studies related to association and clinical use for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutics. Although the data presented here is more related to the bacterial community, many algorithms could be applied in general, regardless of the feature type.

33671569,Nutritional Components in Western Diet Versus Mediterranean Diet at the Gut Microbiota-Immune System Interplay. Implications for Health and Disease.,"The most prevalent diseases of our time, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) (including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and some types of cancer) are rising worldwide. All of them share the condition of an ""inflammatory disorder"", with impaired immune functions frequently caused or accompanied by alterations in gut microbiota. These multifactorial maladies also have in common malnutrition related to physiopathology. In this context, diet is the greatest modulator of immune system-microbiota crosstalk, and much interest, and new challenges, are arising in the area of precision nutrition as a way towards treatment and prevention. It is a fact that the westernized diet (WD) is partly responsible for the increased prevalence of NCDs, negatively affecting both gut microbiota and the immune system. Conversely, other nutritional approaches, such as Mediterranean diet (MD), positively influence immune system and gut microbiota, and is proposed not only as a potential tool in the clinical management of different disease conditions, but also for prevention and health promotion globally. Thus, the purpose of this review is to determine the regulatory role of nutritional components of WD and MD in the gut microbiota and immune system interplay, in order to understand, and create awareness of, the influence of diet over both key components.",García-Montero C; Fraile-Martínez O; Gómez-Lahoz AM; Pekarek L; Castellanos AJ; Noguerales-Fraguas F; Coca S; Guijarro LG; García-Honduvilla N; Asúnsolo A; Sanchez-Trujillo L; Lahera G; Bujan J; Monserrat J; Álvarez-Mon M; Álvarez-Mon MA; Ortega MA,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33671569/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33559845,Gut Microbiome and Precision Nutrition in Heart Failure: Hype or Hope?,"Over the past decade, the gut microbiome has been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of heart failure (HF) and serves as a mediator that links host genomes and environmental exposure (especially dietary intake) to the development and progression of HF. Given that alterations in gut microbial composition and metabolism are commonly seen in patients with HF, the use of gut microbial metabolites as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, as well as novel therapeutic targets for HF, is promising. Alterations in gut microbial composition and function have bidirectional relationships with HF. Gut microbial metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), and amino acid metabolites, have been shown to play a significant role in HF. For example, TMAO has been consistently demonstrated as an independent predictor of worse prognosis in patients with HF, and a potential therapeutic target for cardiac remodeling and HF. However, clinical studies on dietary interventions targeting gut microbial metabolites have demonstrated inconsistent findings, which could be from variations in the study population, gut microbial communities, and study designs. Measurement of gut microbial metabolites can improve risk stratification and potentially identify HF patients who are more likely to respond to personalized pharmacologic or dietary interventions targeting specific pathways associated with the gut microbiome.",Chaikijurajai T; Tang WHW,Current heart failure reports,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33559845/,1,0,0,0,0,0

33305842,Effects of oral vitamin D supplementation on linear growth and other health outcomes among children under five years of age.,"Vitamin D is a secosteroid hormone that is important for its role in calcium homeostasis to maintain skeletal health. Linear growth faltering and stunting remain pervasive indicators of poor nutrition status among infants and children under five years of age around the world, and low vitamin D status has been linked to poor growth. However, existing evidence on the effects of vitamin D supplementation on linear growth and other health outcomes among infants and children under five years of age has not been systematically reviewed. To assess effects of oral vitamin D supplementation on linear growth and other health outcomes among infants and children under five years of age. In December 2019, we searched CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, 14 other electronic databases, and two trials registries. We also searched the reference lists of relevant publications for any relevant trials, and we contacted key organisations and authors to obtain information on relevant ongoing and unpublished trials. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs assessing the effects of oral vitamin D supplementation, with or without other micronutrients, compared to no intervention, placebo, a lower dose of vitamin D, or the same micronutrients alone (and not vitamin D) in infants and children under five years of age who lived in any country. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Out of 75 studies (187 reports; 12,122 participants) included in the qualitative analysis, 64 studies (169 reports; 10,854 participants) contributed data on our outcomes of interest for meta-analysis. A majority of included studies were conducted in India, USA, and Canada. Two studies reported for-profit funding, two were categorised as receiving mixed funding (non-profit and for-profit), five reported that they received no funding, 26 did not disclose funding sources, and the remaining studies were funded by non-profit funding. Certainty of evidence varied between high and very low across outcomes (all measured at endpoint) for each comparison. Vitamin D supplementation versus placebo or no intervention (31 studies) Compared to placebo or no intervention, vitamin D supplementation (at doses 200 to 2000 IU daily; or up to 300,000 IU bolus at enrolment) may make little to no difference in linear growth (measured length/height in cm) among children under five years of age (mean difference (MD) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.37 to 1.68; 3 studies, 240 participants; low-certainty evidence); probably improves length/height-for-age z-score (L/HAZ) (MD 0.11, 95% CI 0.001 to 0.22; 1 study, 1258 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); and probably makes little to no difference in stunting (risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.01; 1 study, 1247 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). In terms of adverse events, vitamin D supplementation results in little to no difference in developing hypercalciuria compared to placebo (RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.28 to 14.67; 2 studies, 68 participants; high-certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether vitamin D supplementation impacts the development of hypercalcaemia as the certainty of evidence was very low (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.90; 2 studies, 367 participants). Vitamin D supplementation (higher dose) versus vitamin D (lower dose) (34 studies) Compared to a lower dose of vitamin D (100 to 1000 IU daily; or up to 300,000 IU bolus at enrolment), higher-dose vitamin D supplementation (200 to 6000 IU daily; or up to 600,000 IU bolus at enrolment) may have little to no effect on linear growth, but we are uncertain about this result (MD 1.00, 95% CI -2.22 to 0.21; 5 studies, 283 participants), and it may make little to no difference in L/HAZ (MD 0.40, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.86; 2 studies, 105 participants; low-certainty evidence). No studies evaluated stunting. As regards adverse events, higher-dose vitamin D supplementation may make little to no difference in developing hypercalciuria (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.35; 6 studies, 554 participants; low-certainty evidence) or in hypercalcaemia (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.18; 5 studies, 986 participants; low-certainty evidence) compared to lower-dose vitamin D supplementation. Vitamin D supplementation (higher dose) + micronutrient(s) versus vitamin D (lower dose) + micronutrient(s) (9 studies) Supplementation with a higher dose of vitamin D (400 to 2000 IU daily, or up to 300,000 IU bolus at enrolment) plus micronutrients, compared to a lower dose (200 to 2000 IU daily, or up to 90,000 IU bolus at enrolment) of vitamin D with the same micronutrients, probably makes little to no difference in linear growth (MD 0.60, 95% CI -3.33 to 4.53; 1 study, 25 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No studies evaluated L/HAZ or stunting. In terms of adverse events, higher-dose vitamin D supplementation with micronutrients, compared to lower-dose vitamin D with the same micronutrients, may make little to no difference in developing hypercalciuria (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.48; 1 study, 86 participants; low-certainty evidence) and probably makes little to no difference in developing hypercalcaemia (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.90, 1.11; 2 studies, 126 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Four studies measured hyperphosphataemia and three studies measured kidney stones, but they reported no occurrences and therefore were not included in the comparison for these outcomes. Evidence suggests that oral vitamin D supplementation may result in little to no difference in linear growth, stunting, hypercalciuria, or hypercalcaemia, compared to placebo or no intervention, but may result in a slight increase in length/height-for-age z-score (L/HAZ). Additionally, evidence suggests that compared to lower doses of vitamin D, with or without micronutrients, vitamin D supplementation may result in little to no difference in linear growth, L/HAZ, stunting, hypercalciuria, or hypercalcaemia. Small sample sizes, substantial heterogeneity in terms of population and intervention parameters, and high risk of bias across many of the included studies limit our ability to confirm with any certainty the effects of vitamin D on our outcomes. Larger, well-designed studies of long duration (several months to years) are recommended to confirm whether or not oral vitamin D supplementation may impact linear growth in children under five years of age, among both those who are healthy and those with underlying infectious or non-communicable health conditions.",Huey SL; Acharya N; Silver A; Sheni R; Yu EA; Peña-Rosas JP; Mehta S,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33305842/,0,1,0,1,0,0

Gut microbes affect host nutritional status through their role in energy harvest and nutrient availability. Consequently, GM modulation could contribute to fulfil nutritional requirements and in this way conquer malnutrition and disease.

However, person-specific mechanisms driving nutritional impacts on the human host remain incompletely understood, while current dietary recommendations remain empirical and nonpersonalized. Precision nutrition aims to harness individualized bodies of data, including the human gut microbiome, in predicting person-specific physiological responses (such as glycemic responses) to food. With these advances notwithstanding, many unknowns remain, including the long-term efficacy of such interventions in delaying or reversing human metabolic disease, mechanisms driving these dietary effects, and the extent of the contribution of the gut microbiome to these processes. We summarize these conceptual advances, while highlighting challenges and means of addressing them in the next decade of study of precision medicine, toward generation of insights that may help to evolve precision nutrition as an effective future tool in a variety of ""multifactorial"" human disorders.",Leshem A; Segal E; Elinav E,mSystems,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32994289/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32721626,Nano-enabled personalized nutrition: Developing multicomponent-bioactive colloidal delivery systems.,"There is growing interest in the production of foods and beverages with nutrient and nutraceutical profiles tailored to an individual's specific nutritional requirements. In principle, these personalized nutrition products are formulated based on the genetics, epigenetics, metabolism, microbiome, phenotype, lifestyle, age, gender, and health status of a person. A challenge in this area is to create customized functional food and beverage products that contain the required combination of bioactive agents, such as lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, nutraceuticals, prebiotics and probiotics. Nanotechnology may facilitate the development of these kind of products since it can be used to encapsulate one or more bioactive agent in a single colloidal delivery system. This delivery system may contain one or more different kinds of colloidal particle, specifically designed to protect each nutrient in the food, but then deliver it in a bioavailable form after ingestion. This review article provides an overview of the different kinds of bioactives that need to be delivered, as well as some of the challenges associated with incorporating them into functional foods and beverages. It then highlights how nanotech-enabled colloidal delivery systems can be developed to encapsulate multiple bioactive agents in a form suitable for functional food applications, particularly in the personalized nutrition field.",McClements DJ,Advances in colloid and interface science,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32721626/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32610641,Plant-Dominant Low-Protein Diet for Conservative Management of Chronic Kidney Disease.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects >10% of the adult population. Each year, approximately 120,000 Americans develop end-stage kidney disease and initiate dialysis, which is costly and associated with functional impairments, worse health-related quality of life, and high early-mortality rates, exceeding 20% in the first year. Recent declarations by the World Kidney Day and the U.S. Government Executive Order seek to implement strategies that reduce the burden of kidney failure by slowing CKD progression and controlling uremia without dialysis. Pragmatic dietary interventions may have a role in improving CKD outcomes and preventing or delaying dialysis initiation. Evidence suggests that a patient-centered plant-dominant low-protein diet (PLADO) of 0.6–0.8 g/kg/day composed of >50% plant-based sources, administered by dietitians trained in non-dialysis CKD care, is promising and consistent with the precision nutrition. The scientific premise of the PLADO stems from the observations that high protein diets with high meat intake not only result in higher cardiovascular disease risk but also higher CKD incidence and faster CKD progression due to increased intraglomerular pressure and glomerular hyperfiltration. Meat intake increases production of nitrogenous end-products, worsens uremia, and may increase the risk of constipation with resulting hyperkalemia from the typical low fiber intake. A plant-dominant, fiber-rich, low-protein diet may lead to favorable alterations in the gut microbiome, which can modulate uremic toxin generation and slow CKD progression, along with reducing cardiovascular risk. PLADO is a heart-healthy, safe, flexible, and feasible diet that could be the centerpiece of a conservative and preservative CKD-management strategy that challenges the prevailing dialysis-centered paradigm.",Kalantar-Zadeh K; Joshi S; Schlueter R; Cooke J; Brown-Tortorici A; Donnelly M; Schulman S; Lau WL; Rhee CM; Streja E; Tantisattamo E; Ferrey AJ; Hanna R; Chen JLT; Malik S; Nguyen DV; Crowley ST; Kovesdy CP,Nutrients,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32610641/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31928426,Precision (Personalized) Nutrition: Understanding Metabolic Heterogeneity.,"People differ in their requirements for and responses to nutrients and bioactive molecules in the diet. Many inputs contribute to metabolic heterogeneity (including variations in genetics, epigenetics, microbiome, lifestyle, diet intake, and environmental exposure). Precision nutrition is not about developing unique prescriptions for individual people but rather about stratifying people into different subgroups of the population on the basis of biomarkers of the above-listed sources of metabolic variation and then using this stratification to better estimate the different subgroups' dietary requirements, thereby enabling better dietary recommendations and interventions. The hope is that we will be able to subcategorize people into ever-smaller groups that can be targeted in terms of recommendations, but we will never achieve this at the individual level, thus, the choice of precision nutrition rather than personalized nutrition to designate this new field. This review focuses mainly on genetically related sources of metabolic heterogeneity and identifies challenges that need to be overcome to achieve a full understanding of the complex interactions between the many sources of metabolic heterogeneity that make people differ from one another in their requirements for and responses to foods.

Yet we are only beginning to understand the impact of these interventions on the gut microbiota and the physiological consequences for the human host, thus forging the way towards evidence-based scientific validation. However, in many studies a percentage of participants can be defined as 'non-responders' and scientists are beginning to unravel what differentiates these from 'responders;' and it is now clear that an individual's baseline microbiota can influence an individual's response. Thus, microbiome composition can potentially serve as a biomarker to predict responsiveness to interventions, diets and dietary components enabling greater opportunities for its use towards disease prevention and health promotion. In Part I of this two-part review, we reviewed the current state of the science in terms of the gut microbiota and the role of diet and dietary components in shaping it and subsequent consequences for human health. In Part II, we examine the efficacy of gut-microbiota modulating therapies at different life stages and their potential to aid in the management of undernutrition and overnutrition. Given the significance of an individual's gut microbiota, we investigate the feasibility of microbiome testing and we discuss guidelines for evaluating the scientific validity of evidence for providing personalised microbiome-based dietary advice.

31225587,The Role of the Gut Microbiome in Predicting Response to Diet and the Development of Precision Nutrition Models. Part II: Results.,"The gut microbiota is increasingly implicated in the health and metabolism of its human host. The host's diet is a major component influencing the composition and function of the gut microbiota, and mounting evidence suggests that the composition and function of the gut microbiota influence the host's metabolic response to diet. This effect of the gut microbiota on personalized dietary response is a growing focus of precision nutrition research and may inform the effort to tailor dietary advice to the individual. Because the gut microbiota has been shown to be malleable to some extent, it may also allow for therapeutic alterations of the gut microbiota in order to alter response to certain dietary components. This article is the second in a 2-part review of the current research in the field of precision nutrition incorporating the gut microbiota into studies investigating interindividual variability in response to diet. Part I reviews the methods used by researchers to design and carry out such studies as well as analyze the results subsequently obtained.

31022973,"Precision Nutrition and the Microbiome, Part I: Current State of the Science.","The gut microbiota is a highly complex community which evolves and adapts to its host over a lifetime. It has been described as a virtual organ owing to the myriad of functions it performs, including the production of bioactive metabolites, regulation of immunity, energy homeostasis and protection against pathogens. These activities are dependent on the quantity and quality of the microbiota alongside its metabolic potential, which are dictated by a number of factors, including diet and host genetics. In this regard, the gut microbiome is malleable and varies significantly from host to host. These two features render the gut microbiome a candidate 'organ' for the possibility of precision microbiomics - the use of the gut microbiome as a biomarker to predict responsiveness to specific dietary constituents to generate precision diets and interventions for optimal health. With this in mind, this two-part review investigates the current state of the science in terms of the influence of diet and specific dietary components on the gut microbiota and subsequent consequences for health status, along with opportunities to modulate the microbiota for improved health and the potential of the microbiome as a biomarker to predict responsiveness to dietary components. In particular, in Part I, we examine the development of the microbiota from birth and its role in health.

30553801,Addressing the Nutritional Phenotype Through Personalized Nutrition for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management.,"The primary focus of public health recommendations related to the prevention of food-related chronic disease has been on the adoption of healthy dietary patterns; however, implementation has been challenging. There has been increasing recognition that an individual's diet and environment may impact disease susceptibility by affecting the expression of genes involved in critical metabolic pathways. Precision nutrition (PN) has emerged to translate discoveries about diversity in nutrient metabolism between subgroups and the inter-individual variability in the responses to dietary interventions. The overarching goals of PN are to deliver individualized, actionable dietary therapy based on an individual's nutritional phenotype, created from the integration of genetics, metabolic profile, and environmental factors in order to prevent and treat chronic disease. This review addresses the developments of genome- and omic-driven PN and how they have been used to prevent and treat disease, as well as how they might be integrated into broader clinical practice.",Laddu D; Hauser M,Progress in cardiovascular diseases,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30553801/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30082058,Precision Medicine for Nutritional Management in End-Stage Kidney Disease and Transition to Dialysis.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health burden. Dialysis is not only costly but may not be readily available in developing countries. Even in highly developed nations, many patients may prefer to defer or avoid dialysis. Thus, alternative options to dialysis therapy or to complement dialysis are needed urgently and are important objectives in CKD management that could have huge clinical and economic implications globally. The role of nutritional therapy as a strategy to slow CKD progression and uremia was discussed as early as the late 19th and early 20th century, but was only seriously explored in the 1970s. There is a revival of interest recently owing to encouraging data as well as the increase of precision medicine with an emphasis on a personalized approach to CKD management. Although part of the explanation for the inconclusive data may relate to variations in study design and dietary prescription, diversity in genetic make-up, variations in the non-nutritional management of CKD, intra-individual variations in responses to dietary and nondietary treatment, psychosocial factors, and dietary compliance issues, these all may contribute to the heterogeneous data and responses. This brings in the evolving concept of precision medicine, in which disease management should be tailored and individualized according not only to clinical manifestations but also to the genetic make-up and biologic responses to therapy, which may vary depending on genetic composition. Precision nutrition management also should take into account patient demographics, social, psychological, education, and compliance factors, which all may influence the therapeutic needs and responses to the nutritional therapy prescribed. In this review, we provide a novel concept of precision medicine in nutritional management in end-stage kidney disease with a transition to dialysis and propose how this may be the way forward for nutritional therapy in the CKD population.",Wang AY; Kalantar-Zadeh K; Fouque D; Wee PT; Kovesdy CP; Price SR; Kopple JD,Seminars in nephrology,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30082058/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29693607,Harnessing the Power of Microbiome Assessment Tools as Part of Neuroprotective Nutrition and Lifestyle Medicine Interventions.,"An extensive body of evidence documents the importance of the gut microbiome both in health and in a variety of human diseases. Cell and animal studies describing this relationship abound, whilst clinical studies exploring the associations between changes in gut microbiota and the corresponding metabolites with neurodegeneration in the human brain have only begun to emerge more recently. Further, the findings of such studies are often difficult to translate into simple clinical applications that result in measurable health outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to appraise the literature on a select set of faecal biomarkers from a clinician&rsquo;s perspective. This practical review aims to examine key physiological processes that influence both gastrointestinal, as well as brain health, and to discuss how tools such as the characterisation of commensal bacteria, the identification of potential opportunistic, pathogenic and parasitic organisms and the quantification of gut microbiome biomarkers and metabolites can help inform clinical decisions of nutrition and lifestyle medicine practitioners.",Toribio-Mateas M,Microorganisms,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29693607/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29679625,Nutrition therapy within and beyond gestational diabetes.,"With the global rising prevalence of gestational diabetes (GDM), an adaptable, economical approach to nutrition therapy that effectively controls maternal glycemia while promoting normal fetal growth will have far-reaching implications. The conventional focus has been to rigidly limit all types of carbohydrate. While controlling glucose, this approach fosters maternal anxiety and is a primary barrier to adherence. Many mothers substitute fat for carbohydrate, which may unintentionally enhance lipolysis, promote elevated free fatty acids (FFA), and worsen maternal insulin resistance (IR). Nutrition that worsens IR may facilitate nutrient shunting across the placenta, promoting excess fetal fat accretion. Evidence suggests that liberalizing higher quality, nutrient-dense carbohydrates results in controlled fasting/postprandial glucose, lower FFA, improved insulin action, vascular benefits, and may reduce excess infant adiposity. Thus, a less carbohydrate-restricted approach may improve maternal adherence when combined with higher quality carbohydrates, lower fat, appropriate caloric intake, and ethnically acceptable foods. Such a diet can be culturally sensitive, socioeconomically attentive, minimize further weight gain in GDM, with potential relevance for pregnancies complicated by overweight/obesity. Future research is needed to better understand the effect of macronutrient composition on the placenta and gut microbiome, the benefits/risks of nonnutritive sweeteners, and whether precision-nutrition is beneficial in pregnancy.",Hernandez TL; Mande A; Barbour LA,Diabetes research and clinical practice,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29679625/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29433995,Precision nutrition for prevention and management of type 2 diabetes.,"Precision nutrition aims to prevent and manage chronic diseases by tailoring dietary interventions or recommendations to one or a combination of an individual's genetic background, metabolic profile, and environmental exposures. Recent advances in genomics, metabolomics, and gut microbiome technologies have offered opportunities as well as challenges in the use of precision nutrition to prevent and manage type 2 diabetes. Nutrigenomics studies have identified genetic variants that influence intake and metabolism of specific nutrients and predict individuals' variability in response to dietary interventions. Metabolomics has revealed metabolomic fingerprints of food and nutrient consumption and uncovered new metabolic pathways that are potentially modified by diet. Dietary interventions have been successful in altering abundance, composition, and activity of gut microbiota that are relevant for food metabolism and glycaemic control. In addition, mobile apps and wearable devices facilitate real-time assessment of dietary intake and provide feedback which can improve glycaemic control and diabetes management. By integrating these technologies with big data analytics, precision nutrition has the potential to provide personalised nutrition guidance for more effective prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. Despite these technological advances, much research is needed before precision nutrition can be widely used in clinical and public health settings. Currently, the field of precision nutrition faces challenges including a lack of robust and reproducible results, the high cost of omics technologies, and methodological issues in study design as well as high-dimensional data analyses and interpretation. Evidence is needed to support the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and additional benefits of precision nutrition beyond traditional nutrition intervention approaches. Therefore, we should manage unrealistically high expectations and balance the emerging field of precision nutrition with public health nutrition strategies to improve diet quality and prevent type 2 diabetes and its complications.",Wang DD; Hu FB,The lancet.

29107872,Inflammation and gut-brain axis link obesity to cognitive dysfunction: plausible pharmacological interventions.,"Obesity prevalence is increasing steadily throughout the world's population in most countries and in parallel the prevalence of metabolic disorders including cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes is also rising, but less is reported about excessive adiposity relationship with poorer cognitive performance, cognitive decline and dementia. Some human clinical studies have evidenced that obesity is related to the risk of the development of mild cognitive impairment, in the form of short-term memory and executive function deficits, as well as dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The precise mechanisms that underlie the connections between obesity and the risk of cognitive impairment are still largely unknown but potential avenues of further research include insulin resistance, the gut-brain axis, and systemic mediators and central inflammation processes. A common feature of metabolic diseases is a chronic and low-grade activation of the inflammatory system. This inflammation may eventually spread from peripheral tissue to the brain, and recent reports suggest that neuroinflammation is an important causal mechanism in cognitive decline. This inflammatory status could be triggered by changes in the gut microbiota composition. Consumption of diets high in fat and sugar influences the microbiota composition, which may lead to an imbalanced microbial population in the gut. Thus, it has recently been hypothesized that the gut microbiota could be part of a mechanistic link between the consumption of high fat and other unbalanced diets and impaired cognition, termed 'gut-brain axis'. The present review will aim at providing an integrative analysis of the effects of obesity and unbalanced diets on cognitive performance and discusses some of the potential mechanisms involved, namely inflammation and changes in gut-brain axis. Moreover, the review aims to analyze anti-inflammatory drugs that have been tested for the treatment of cognition and obesity, recently approved anti-obesity drugs that could also have an impact on central nervous system, and bioactive food compounds that modulate gut microbiota and could have an impact through the gut-brain axis. In this era of precision nutrition medicine, it is imperative to identify the various metabolic-neurocognitive phenotypes in order to understand the processes that drive these diseases so that targeted therapeutic strategies to prevent and successfully manage these complex, multifactorial diseases could be designed and developed.",Solas M; Milagro FI; Ramírez MJ; Martínez JA,Current opinion in pharmacology,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29107872/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28878180,Bariatric Surgery and Precision Nutrition.,"This review provides a literature overview of new findings relating nutritional genomics and bariatric surgery. It also describes the importance of nutritional genomics concepts in personalized bariatric management. It includes a discussion of the potential role bariatric surgery plays in altering the three pillars of nutritional genomics: nutrigenetics, nutrigenomics, and epigenetics. We present studies that show the effect of each patient's genetic and epigenetic variables on the response to surgical weight loss treatment. We include investigations that demonstrate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms with obesity phenotypes and their influence on weight loss after bariatric surgery. We also present reports on how significant weight loss induced by bariatric surgery impacts telomere length, and we discuss studies on the existence of an epigenetic signature associated with surgery outcomes and specific gene methylation profile, which may help to predict weight loss after a surgical procedure. Finally, we show articles which evidence that bariatric surgery may affect expression of numerous genes involved in different metabolic pathways and consequently induce functional and taxonomic changes in gut microbial communities. The role nutritional genomics plays in responses to weight loss after bariatric surgery is evident. Better understanding of the molecular pathways involved in this process is necessary for successful weight management and maintenance.",Nicoletti CF; Cortes-Oliveira C; Pinhel MAS; Nonino CB,Nutrients,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28878180/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28829397,Precision Nutrition: A Review of Personalized Nutritional Approaches for the Prevention and Management of Metabolic Syndrome.,"The translation of the growing increase of findings emerging from basic nutritional science into meaningful and clinically relevant dietary advices represents nowadays one of the main challenges of clinical nutrition. From nutrigenomics to deep phenotyping, many factors need to be taken into account in designing personalized and unbiased nutritional solutions for individuals or population sub-groups. Likewise, a concerted effort among basic, clinical scientists and health professionals will be needed to establish a comprehensive framework allowing the implementation of these new findings at the population level. In a world characterized by an overwhelming increase in the prevalence of obesity and associated metabolic disturbances, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, tailored nutrition prescription represents a promising approach for both the prevention and management of metabolic syndrome. This review aims to discuss recent works in the field of precision nutrition analyzing most relevant aspects affecting an individual response to lifestyle/nutritional interventions. Latest advances in the analysis and monitoring of dietary habits, food behaviors, physical activity/exercise and deep phenotyping will be discussed, as well as the relevance of novel applications of nutrigenomics, metabolomics and microbiota profiling. Recent findings in the development of precision nutrition are highlighted. Finally, results from published studies providing examples of new avenues to successfully implement innovative precision nutrition approaches will be reviewed.",de Toro-Martín J; Arsenault BJ; Després JP; Vohl MC,Nutrients,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28829397/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28387720,Gene-Diet Interaction and Precision Nutrition in Obesity.,"The rapid rise of obesity during the past decades has coincided with a profound shift of our living environment, including unhealthy dietary patterns, a sedentary lifestyle, and physical inactivity. Genetic predisposition to obesity may have interacted with such an obesogenic environment in determining the obesity epidemic. Growing studies have found that changes in adiposity and metabolic response to low-calorie weight loss diets might be modified by genetic variants related to obesity, metabolic status and preference to nutrients. This review summarized data from recent studies of gene-diet interactions, and discussed integration of research of metabolomics and gut microbiome, as well as potential application of the findings in precision nutrition.",Heianza Y; Qi L,International journal of molecular sciences,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28387720/,1,0,0,0,0,0
27286972,"Guide and Position of the International Society of Nutrigenetics/Nutrigenomics on Personalized Nutrition: Part 2 - Ethics, Challenges and Endeavors of Precision Nutrition.","Nutrigenetics considers the influence of individual genetic variation on differences in response to dietary components, nutrient requirements and predisposition to disease. Nutrigenomics involves the study of interactions between the genome and diet, including how nutrients affect the transcription and translation process plus subsequent proteomic and metabolomic changes, and also differences in response to dietary factors based on the individual genetic makeup. Personalized characteristics such as age, gender, physical activity, physiological state and social status, and special conditions such as pregnancy and risk of disease can inform dietary advice that more closely meets individual needs. Precision nutrition has a promising future in treating the individual according to their phenotype and genetic characteristics, aimed at both the treatment and prevention of disease. However, many aspects are still in progress and remain as challenges for the future of nutrition. The integration of the human genotype and microbiome needs to be better understood. Further advances in data interpretation tools are also necessary, so that information obtained through newer tests and technologies can be properly transferred to consumers. Indeed, precision nutrition will integrate genetic data with phenotypical, social, cultural and personal preferences and lifestyles matters to provide a more individual nutrition, but considering public health perspectives, where ethical, legal and policy aspects need to be defined and implemented.",Kohlmeier M; De Caterina R; Ferguson LR; Görman U; Allayee H; Prasad C; Kang JX; Nicoletti CF; Martinez JA,Journal of nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27286972/,0,0,0,0,0,0
