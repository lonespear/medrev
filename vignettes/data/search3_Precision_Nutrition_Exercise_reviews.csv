41515177,Thyroid-Microbiome Allostasis and Mitochondrial Performance: An Integrative Perspective in Exercise Physiology.,"Exercise acts as a physiological stimulus, requiring precise coordination among endocrine, microbial, and mitochondrial systems to maintain metabolic stability through allostatic regulation. The goal of the article is to integrate multidisciplinary evidence to characterize the thyroid-microbiome-mitochondrial axis as a key regulator of the allostatic state in athletic physiological response. During acute, chronic, and overload training phases, the thyroid-microbiome-mitochondrial axis operates bidirectionally, coupling microbial signaling with endocrine and mitochondrial networks to mediate metabolic response to exercise. This response shows interindividual variability driven by sex, age, genetics, and nutritional status, shaping the boundaries between adaptive efficiency and allostatic overload. Microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and secondary bile acids, modulate deiodinase activity, bile acid recycling, and mitochondrial biogenesis through AMPK-SIRT1-PGC1α signaling, optimizing substrate use and thermogenic capacity. Thyroid hormones reciprocally regulate gut motility, luminal pH, and bile secretion, maintaining microbial diversity and mineral absorption. Under excessive training load, caloric restriction, or inadequate recovery, this network becomes transiently unbalanced: SCFA synthesis decreases, D3 activity increases, and a reversible low-T<sub>3</sub>/high-rT<sub>3</sub> pattern emerges, resembling early Hashimoto- or Graves-like responses. Selenium-, zinc-, and iron-dependent enzymes form the redox link between microbial metabolism, thyroid control, and mitochondrial defense. In conclusion, the thyroid-microbiome-mitochondrial axis provides the physiological basis for the allostatic state, a reversible phase of dynamic recalibration that integrates training, nutrition, environmental stress, and circadian cues to sustain thyroid activity, mitochondrial efficiency, and microbial balance. This integrative perspective supports precision interventions to optimize recovery and performance in athletes.",Odriozola A; González A; Odriozola I; Corbi F; Álvarez-Herms J,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41515177/,1,0,0,0,0,0

41374076,"The Gut-Muscle-Immune Axis in Motion: Mechanistic Synergies of SCFA Metabolism, Exercise, and Microbial Cross-Feeding.","The gut microbiota plays a fundamental role in metabolic and immune homeostasis through the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). These metabolites influence mitochondrial biogenesis, muscle energetics, epithelial barrier stability, and inflammatory regulation via G-protein-coupled receptors, AMPK-PGC-1α signaling, and epigenetic remodeling. This review synthesizes current evidence on the gut-muscle-immune axis, emphasizing how dietary fermentable substrates, microbial cross-feeding interactions, and structured exercise modulate SCFA production and shape host physiological adaptation. We integrated findings from human and animal studies, multi-omic analyses, metabolomic and microbiome research, and exercise physiology to outline mechanistic links between microbial metabolism and systemic resilience. Key mechanistic pathways connecting dietary fiber fermentation to mitochondrial function, redox regulation, immune homeostasis, and metabolic plasticity are summarized. We further present the Targeted Gut Protocol 2.0, a conceptual 12-week framework combining fiber-diversity targets, lactate-guided exercise periodization, biomarker monitoring, and adaptive feedback mechanisms to enhance endogenous SCFA availability. SCFA-driven metabolic plasticity provides an integrative model through which lifestyle behaviors can modulate host physiology. Future research should prioritize standardized sampling approaches, causal inference methods, multi-omic integration, and AI-supported personalization to refine mechanistic understanding and strengthen translational potential.",Réka F; Zsófia B; Ádám B; Péter F,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41374076/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41373948,Personalized Nutritional Assessment and Intervention for Athletes: A Network Physiology Approach.,"Nutritional assessment and intervention in athletes, a central focus of sports medicine and healthcare, has increasingly shifted in recent years toward precision nutrition-an approach that individualizes dietary recommendations according to genetic profile, microbiome composition, lifestyle factors, and health status. Despite its promising potential, this approach faces significant limitations, including the challenge of integrating complex and dynamic interactions among multilevel indicators, and the relatively high costs associated with omics technologies. The aim of this paper is to propose a nutritional assessment and intervention model grounded in the Network Physiology of Exercise, an emerging scientific field that investigates the horizontal and vertical dynamic interactions among nested physiological levels and conceptualizes athletes as complex adaptive systems (CAS). The proposal integrates social, environmental, behavioral and psychobiological information, extracted particularly from semi-structured interviews based on CAS properties. Accordingly, the traditional dietary assessment tools are replaced by open and guided interviews that allow professionals and practitioners to co-construct meaningful insights and extract qualitative data through a reflexive thematic analysis. From a CAS perspective, the multidimensional and multi-timescale personal and environmental constrains affecting their eating behavior were integrated through a hierarchically nested organization. Eliciting the dynamics of emotional contexts, behavioral patterns, and psychophysiological states, the interviews become both a method of assessment and an intervention in itself.",Prieto A; Lizarraga MA; Balagué N,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41373948/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41314750,Personalized management of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dopaminergic neuron loss, α-synuclein aggregation, and oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. These contribute to motor symptoms like bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and postural instability, alongside non-motor issues such as cognitive decline and autonomic dysfunction. With rising global prevalence, especially in aging populations, understanding PD's complex pathophysiology is essential for advancing effective therapeutic strategies. This chapter offers a comprehensive overview of Parkinson's disease, covering its demographic trends, molecular mechanisms, symptoms, and current pharmacological treatments, including their mechanisms, classifications, benefits, and side effects. The central focus is on the emerging shift from standard symptomatic care to personalized, precision-based treatment strategies. These include gene-targeted therapies like RNA interference and CRISPR-Cas9, mitochondrial-based approaches, and stem cell innovations such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Pharmacogenetic profiling and biomarker-based interventions further support individualized therapeutic plans by predicting drug responses and tracking disease progression. This chapter explores patient-centric models like personalized neurorehabilitation, DBS, and cognitive-behavioral therapy, alongside advanced technologies such as AI, VR, AR, and wearable devices that enhance treatment, symptom monitoring, and real-time feedback through mobile applications. Lifestyle adaptations, including precision nutrition and customized exercise regimens, are highlighted as key components of comprehensive care. This chapter highlights a personalized, multi-dimensional approach to Parkinson's disease management, integrating molecular, technological, and lifestyle strategies to both ease symptoms and modify disease progression.",Chakraborty D; Roy PK; Das R; Mal C,Progress in brain research,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41314750/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41186329,Evaluating untargeted metabolomics pipelines for sports nutrition research: a review.,"Untargeted metabolomics has emerged as a transformative approach in sports nutrition research, offering an unbiased means to characterize the complex biochemical responses to exercise, training, and dietary interventions. Unlike targeted assays restricted to predefined metabolites, untargeted strategies capture broad metabolic perturbations across lipid, carbohydrate, amino acid, and nucleotide pathways, enabling the discovery of novel biomarkers and unanticipated physiological mechanisms. This review critically evaluates the design and application of untargeted metabolomic pipelines in the context of exercise and nutrition science, from pre-analytical sample handling and analytical platforms such as NMR, LC-MS, and GC-MS, to data processing using tools like XCMS, MZmine, and MS-DIAL, and subsequent statistical and bioinformatic interpretation. Key applications include delineating acute metabolic shocks induced by endurance exercise, identifying athlete-specific metabolic phenotypes shaped by chronic training, and assessing the impact of nutritional interventions such as fruit intake, amino acid supplementation, or polyphenol-rich foods on exercise recovery and oxidative stress. The integration of metabolomics with other omics, particularly microbiome metagenomics and lipidomics, highlights the potential for systems-level insights into host-microbe-diet interactions. Nonetheless, significant challenges remain, including the reproducibility of findings, difficulties in metabolite identification, and the translational gap between large datasets and actionable nutritional strategies. By synthesizing current strengths, limitations, and controversies, this review emphasizes that the future of sports metabolomics lies in methodological standardization, multi-omics integration, and validation of candidate biomarkers in independent cohorts. Collectively, these efforts position untargeted metabolomics as a cornerstone for advancing precision nutrition and personalized performance monitoring in athletes.",Liu Y; Liu X; Hu Y; Gao F; Yu W; Cheng F,Analytical methods : advancing methods and applications,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41186329/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41096907,"Dietary and Pharmacological Modulation of Aging-Related Metabolic Pathways: Molecular Insights, Clinical Evidence, and a Translational Model.","Advances in geroscience suggest that aging is modulated by molecular pathways that are amenable to dietary and pharmacological intervention. We conducted an integrative critical review of caloric restriction (CR), intermittent fasting (IF), and caloric restriction mimetics (CR-mimetics) to compare shared mechanisms, clinical evidence, limitations, and translational potential. Across modalities, CR and IF consistently activate AMP-activated protein kinase and sirtuins, inhibit mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) signaling, and enhance autophagy, aligning with improvements in insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, low-grade inflammation, and selected epigenetic aging measures in humans. CR-mimetics, such as metformin, resveratrol, rapamycin, and spermidine, partially reproduce these effects; however, long-term safety and efficacy in healthy populations remain incompletely defined. Methodological constraints-short trial duration, selective samples, intermediate (nonclinical) endpoints, and limited adherence monitoring-impede definitive conclusions on hard outcomes (frailty, disability, hospitalization, mortality). We propose the Active Management of Aging and Longevity (AMAL) model, a three-level biomarker-guided framework that integrates personalized diet, chrono-nutrition, exercise, and the selective use of CR-mimetics, along with digital monitoring and decision support. AMAL emphasizes epigenetic clocks, multi-omics profiling, inflammatory and microbiome metrics, and adaptive protocols to enhance adherence and clinical relevance. Overall, CR, IF, and CR mimetics constitute promising, complementary strategies to modulate biological aging; rigorous long-term trials with standardized biomarkers and clinically meaningful endpoints are needed to enable their scalable implementation.",Murillo-Cancho AF; Lozano-Paniagua D; Nievas-Soriano BJ,International journal of molecular sciences,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41096907/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40953839,Gut Microbiota-Targeted Polyphenol Interventions: A Novel Paradigm and Synergistic Strategies for Obesity Management.,"Obesity has emerged as a major metabolic disorder threatening global public health, with gut microbiota (GM) dysbiosis recognized as a key pathogenic driver. While existing reviews have explored associations between GM and obesity (e.g., the gut-liver axis), this review focuses specifically on polyphenols to establish a novel paradigm of ""GM-targeted polyphenol interventions."" Naturally occurring polyphenols exhibit unique advantages in obesity management; however, their systemic effects critically depend on GM-mediated biotransformation. Herein, we propose the ""Polyphenol-GM Axis"" as the core mechanism underpinning polyphenol efficacy against obesity, synthesizing and integrating current evidence. This comprehensive review elucidates how polyphenols from diverse sources ameliorate obesity through GM modulation: (1) remodeling gut-liver crosstalk via bile acid metabolism; (2) inhibiting lipogenesis through GM-derived metabolites; (3) restoring intestinal barrier integrity; (4) blocking inflammatory cascades. We elucidate causal relationships between polyphenol-induced GM shifts and host metabolic outcomes, revealing targeted pathways for bidirectional ""microbiota-host"" regulation. Critically, we propose that combining GM-targeted polyphenol interventions with lifestyle modifications (diet/exercise) enables precision nutrition. This paradigm provides a theoretical foundation for developing polyphenol-based therapeutics beyond nutritional supplements. Future research should prioritize personalized GM modulation and structural optimization of polyphenols to accelerate their translation from functional foods to clinical agents for obesity management.",Cai Y; Xu J; Wang B,Phytotherapy research : PTR,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40953839/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40946974,Selenium and brain aging: A comprehensive review with a focus on hippocampal neurogenesis.,"Brain aging is accompanied by progressive cognitive decline and increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases, with adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) playing a pivotal role in maintaining cognitive resilience. Selenium, an essential trace element, exerts significant neuroprotective and neurogenic effects predominantly through its incorporation into selenoproteins, which regulate oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and synaptic plasticity. This review synthesizes recent advances delineating selenium's metabolism, bioavailability, and its multifaceted roles in brain development, function, and aging, emphasizing mechanisms underpinning hippocampal neurogenesis. Key molecular pathways influenced by selenium include phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/Wingless/Integrated (Wnt) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) signaling pathways that promote neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. Selenium transport via selenoprotein P and its receptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 8 (LRP8) is critical for adequate selenium delivery to the hippocampus to support neurogenesis, with exercise demonstrated to potentiate this axis. Selenium also mitigates ferroptosis, preserves mitochondrial integrity, and modulates neuroimmune interactions by attenuating microglial activation and inflammasome signaling, fostering a neurogenic environment. Emerging evidence highlights selenium's regulatory effects on RNA expression, including microRNAs modifications, further influencing neuronal health. Despite promising preclinical and observational data, clinical translation remains limited by heterogeneous and short-term studies. Future research priorities include multi-omics investigations, longitudinal cohorts, and addressing global selenium intake disparities through policy initiatives and precision nutrition. By consolidating mechanistic insights with clinical perspectives, this review underscores selenium's potential as a modifiable factor to enhance AHN and cognitive health, advocating for integrated translational strategies to combat brain aging and neurodegeneration.",Daneshpour A; Leite MEN; Wagner KH; Sabico S; Al-Daghri NM; Aldisi D; König D; Gil JFL; Stubbs B,Ageing research reviews,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40946974/,1,0,0,0,0,1
40806058,Histamine Metabolism in IBD: Towards Precision Nutrition.,"Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) exhibit a dysregulated immune response that may be further exacerbated by bioactive compounds, such as histamine. Current dietary guidelines for IBD primarily focus on symptom management and flare-up prevention, yet targeted nutritional strategies addressing histamine metabolism remain largely unexplored. This narrative review aims to summarize the existing literature on the complex interplay between IBD and histamine metabolism and propose a novel dietary framework for managing IBD progression in patients with histamine intolerance (HIT). Relevant studies were identified through a comprehensive literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science. The proposed low-histamine diet (LHD) aims to reduce the overall histamine burden in the body through two primary strategies: (1) minimizing exogenous intake by limiting high-histamine and histamine-releasing foods and (2) reducing endogenous histamine production by modulating gut microbiota composition, specifically targeting histamine-producing bacteria. In parallel, identifying individuals who are histamine-intolerant and understanding the role of histamine-degrading enzymes, such as diamine oxidase (DAO) and histamine-N-methyltransferase (HNMT), are emerging as important areas of focus. Despite growing interest in the role of histamine and mast cell activation in gut inflammation, no clinical trials have investigated the effects of a low-histamine diet in IBD populations. Therefore, future research should prioritize the implementation of LHD interventions in IBD patients to evaluate their generalizability and clinical applicability.",Kanta D; Katsamakas E; Gudiksen AMB; Jalili M,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40806058/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40625617,The human gut microbiota is associated with host lifestyle: a comprehensive narrative review.,"The gut microbiota serves as a critical interface between lifestyle factors and host physiology. Despite extensive research on individual domains including diet, sleep, and exercise, an integrated understanding of their synergistic effects on microbial communities remains incomplete. This knowledge gap limits our ability to develop targeted microbiome-based interventions for metabolic and immune-related disorders. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of peer-reviewed literature from 2000 to present, identified through systematic searches of PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus using key terms related to gut microbiota and lifestyle interventions. Our analysis focused on studies incorporating microbiome profiling techniques, controlled lifestyle interventions, and multi-omics data integration. The review prioritized mechanistic insights from both clinical and preclinical investigations while critically assessing methodological approaches across the field. High-fiber dietary patterns consistently promoted the abundance of beneficial, short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria, though with notable inter-individual variation. Circadian rhythm disruption was associated with reduced microbial diversity and expansion of pro-inflammatory bacterial taxa, paralleling increases in systemic inflammation markers. Athletic populations demonstrated unique microbial signatures characterized by enhanced metabolic potential, with distinct taxonomic profiles emerging across different sport disciplines. This work synthesizes current evidence into a novel framework for understanding lifestyle-microbiota interactions, while identifying key challenges in study design and data interpretation. We propose standardized methodological approaches for future investigations and outline translational strategies for personalized microbiota modulation. These insights advance the potential for targeted microbial interventions to optimize metabolic and immune health outcomes.",Zeng Q; Feng X; Hu Y; Su S,Frontiers in microbiology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40625617/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40507171,Selenium and Skeletal Muscle Health in Sports Nutrition.,"Selenium is a trace element of fundamental importance to human health. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have been carried out in the field of skeletal muscle health and sports nutrition. Selenium functions in the human body through selenoproteins. Selenoproteins play an important role in maintaining skeletal muscle function by delaying exercise fatigue and muscle aging. They mainly regulate skeletal muscle by anti-oxidation, regulating signal pathways, and affecting protein metabolism. In this paper, we summarize the latest advancements in research regarding selenium and its impact on skeletal muscle health, along with its applications in sports nutrition.",Wang Q; Huang J; Zhu K; Zuo W,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40507171/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40438271,Exploration of Pathogenesis and Cutting-Edge Treatment Strategies of Sarcopenia: A Narrative Review.,"Sarcopenia a progressive and multifactorial musculoskeletal syndrome characterized by loss of muscle mass and function, poses a significant global health challenge, particularly in aging populations. Epidemiological studies reveal that sarcopenia affects approximately 5-10% of the general population, with prevalence rates escalating dramatically after age 60 to reach 10-27% in older adults. This age-associated increase contributes significantly to healthcare burdens by elevating risks of disability, frailty, and mortality. Despite its profound impact, current clinical approaches to sarcopenia remain limited. While resistance exercise and protein supplementation form the cornerstone of management, their efficacy is often constrained by poor long-term adherence and variable individual responses, highlighting the urgent need for more comprehensive and personalized treatment strategies. The pathogenesis of sarcopenia is complex and influenced by various factors, including aging, inflammation, nutritional deficits, physical inactivity, and mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying this condition are still not fully understood. Recent research has made significant strides in elucidating the intricate mechanisms contributing to sarcopenia, revealing novel insights into its molecular and cellular underpinnings. Notably, emerging evidence points to the pivotal role of mitochondrial dysfunction, altered myokine profiles, and neuromuscular junction degeneration in sarcopenia progression. Additionally, breakthroughs in stem cell therapy, exosome-based treatments, and precision nutrition offer promising avenues for clinical intervention. This review aims to synthesize the latest advancements in sarcopenia research, focusing on the novel contributions to its pathogenesis and treatment strategies. We explore emerging trends such as the role of cellular senescence, epigenetic regulation, and targeted therapeutic interventions that could reshape future approaches to managing sarcopenia. By highlighting recent breakthroughs and cutting-edge research, we hope to advance the understanding of sarcopenia and foster the translation of these findings into effective clinical therapies.",Gao Y; Liu D; Xiao Q; Huang S; Li L; Xie B; Zhou L; Qi Y; Liu Y,Clinical interventions in aging,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40438271/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40161281,Lifestyle Interventions and Innovative Approaches for the Management of Neurodegenerative Disorders in Older Adults-State-Of-The-Art and Future Directions.,"Aging increases the risk of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) like Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD), characterized by neuronal loss and cognitive decline. Potential preventive/therapeutic interventions also include lifestyle changes like nutrition & diet, exercise, leisure and social engagement. Here, we discuss several lifestyle interventions for healthy brain aging, and in older adults with NDs. Balanced diets like the Mediterranean and MIND diets can reduce cognitive decline during aging. Long-term use of specific nutrient combinations in medical food may also exert benefits on memory. Metabolic interventions like calorie restriction (CR) and intermittent fasting (IF) have shown potential benefits in aging. However, their effects on cognitive function in older adults were modestly explored and remain unclear. Clinical trials are ongoing to test the cognitive and health outcomes of CR/IF variants in older adults with AD or PD (associated or not with metabolic disorders). We also highlight the role of cognitive reserve (CoR) in delaying dementia symptoms. Engaging in diverse leisure activities like music and bilingualism may enhance CoR and reduce AD risk. Finally, we outline future directions for promoting healthy brain aging through lifestyle interventions (e.g., personalized diets, precision nutrition, synergistic lifestyle approaches, AI-based technologies to monitor the effectiveness of lifestyle practices).",Popescu I; Lenain M; Rovini E; Ruthsatz M,American journal of lifestyle medicine,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40161281/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39882755,Precision nutrition-based interventions for the management of obesity in children and adolescents up to the age of 19 years.,"Precision nutrition-based methods develop tailored interventions and/or recommendations accounting for determinants of intra- and inter-individual variation in response to the same diet, compared to current 'one-size-fits-all' population-level approaches. Determinants may include genetics, current dietary habits and eating patterns, circadian rhythms, health status, gut microbiome, socioeconomic and psychosocial characteristics, and physical activity. ​​​​In this systematic review, we examined the evidence base for the effect of interventions based on precision nutrition approaches on overweight and obesity in children and adolescents to help inform future research and global guidelines. To examine the impact of precision nutrition-based interventions for the management of obesity in children and adolescents in all their diversity. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science Core Collection, BIOSIS Previews, Global Index Medicus (all regions), IBECS, SciELO, PAHO, PAHO IRIS, WHO IRIS, WHOLIS, Bibliomap, and TRoPHI, as well as the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov. We last searched the databases on 23 July 2024. We did not apply any language restrictions. We included randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that evaluated precision nutrition-based interventions (accounting for 'omics' such as phenotyping, genotyping, gut microbiome; clinical data, baseline dietary intake, postprandial glucose response, etc., and/or including artificial intelligence such as machine learning methods) compared to general or one-size-fits-all interventions or no intervention in children and adolescents aged 0 to 9 years or 10 to 19 years with overweight or obesity. Two review authors independently conducted study screening, data extraction, and risk of bias and GRADE assessments. We used fixed-effect analyses. Our outcomes of interest were physical and mental well-being, physical activity, health-related quality of life, obesity-associated disability, and adverse events associated with the interventions as defined or measured by trialists, and weight change (reduction, stabilisation or maintenance). Two studies (3 references, 105 participants) conducted in Ukraine and Greece met our eligibility criteria. One study reported nonprofit funding sources, whilst the other did not report funding, and the certainty of evidence ranged from very low to low across outcomes (all measured at endpoint). Only one trial (65 participants) contributed data on our primary outcomes of interest. Precision nutrition-based intervention versus one-size-fits-all intervention or standard of care In children 0 to 9 years of age, evidence is very uncertain about the effect of a precision nutrition-based intervention (a computerised Decision Support Tool (DST) that incorporates a variety of participant data and provides personalised diet recommendations based on decision-tree algorithms) on body mass index (BMI) (mean difference (MD) -1.40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.48 to 0.68; 1 study, 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and on weight (MD -2.60 kg, 95% CI -8.42 to 3.22; 1 study, 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence) compared with a one-size-fits-all control intervention. In children and adolescents 10 to 19 years of age, evidence is very uncertain about the effect of a precision nutrition-based intervention (computerised DST) on BMI (MD 3.00 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95% CI -0.26 to 6.26; 1 study, 30 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and on weight (MD 11.40 kg, 95% CI -0.47 to 23.27; 1 study, 30 participants; very low-certainty evidence) compared with a one-size-fits-all control intervention. Based on data from two small studies with a total of 105 participants, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of precision nutrition-based interventions on body weight or BMI. This review was limited by the number of available randomised controlled trials in this relatively nascent field. Given these limitations, the two studies do not provide sufficient evidence to adequately inform practice. Future research should report participant outcome data, including outcomes related to mental, emotional, and functional well-being, in addition to biochemical and physical measures, stratified by World Health Organization-defined age groups (children (0 to 9 years), and children and adolescents (10 to 19 years)). Future studies should also report methods related to randomisation, blinding, and compliance, as well as include prespecified analysis plans.",Huey SL; Mehta NH; Steinhouse RS; Jin Y; Kibbee M; Kuriyan R; Finkelstein JL; Mehta S,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39882755/,0,1,0,1,0,0
39811913,A menu for microbes: unraveling appetite regulation and weight dynamics through the microbiota-brain connection across the lifespan.,"Appetite, as the internal drive for food intake, is often dysregulated in a broad spectrum of conditions associated with over- and under-nutrition across the lifespan. Appetite regulation is a complex, integrative process comprising psychological and behavioral events, peripheral and metabolic inputs, and central neurotransmitter and metabolic interactions. The microbiota-gut-brain axis has emerged as a critical mediator of multiple physiological processes, including energy metabolism, brain function, and behavior. Therefore, the role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in appetite and obesity is receiving increased attention. Omics approaches such as genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics in appetite and weight regulation offer new opportunities for featuring obesity phenotypes. Furthermore, gut-microbiota-targeted approaches such as pre-, pro-, post-, and synbiotic, personalized nutrition, and fecal microbiota transplantation are novel avenues for precision treatments.

39769203,Beyond Calories: Individual Metabolic and Hormonal Adaptations Driving Variability in Weight Management-A State-of-the-Art Narrative Review.,"The global rise in obesity underscores the need for effective weight management strategies that address individual metabolic and hormonal variability, moving beyond the simplistic ""calories in, calories out"" model. Body types-ectomorph, mesomorph, and endomorph-provide a framework for understanding the differences in fat storage, muscle development, and energy expenditure, as each type responds uniquely to caloric intake and exercise. Variability in weight outcomes is influenced by factors such as genetic polymorphisms and epigenetic changes in hormonal signaling pathways and metabolic processes, as well as lifestyle factors, including nutrition, exercise, sleep, and stress. These factors impact the magnitude of lipogenesis and myofibrillar protein synthesis during overfeeding, as well as the extent of lipolysis and muscle proteolysis during caloric restriction, through complex mechanisms that involve changes in the resting metabolic rate, metabolic pathways, and hormonal profiles. Precision approaches, such as nutrigenomics, indirect calorimetry, and artificial-intelligence-based strategies, can potentially leverage these insights to create individualized weight management strategies aligned with each person's unique metabolic profile. By addressing these personalized factors, precision nutrition offers a promising pathway to sustainable and effective weight management outcomes. The main objective of this review is to examine the metabolic and hormonal adaptations driving variability in weight management outcomes and explore how precision nutrition can address these challenges through individualized strategies.",Theodorakis N; Kreouzi M; Pappas A; Nikolaou M,International journal of molecular sciences,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39769203/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39611279,Why protein-energy wasting leads to faster progression of chronic kidney disease.,"Protein-energy wasting (PEW) is increasingly more prevalent as chronic kidney disease (CKD) progresses to more advanced stages. There is a global recognition of the importance of preventing and mitigating PEW in the CKD population not on dialysis given the goal of extending dialysis-free time and delaying dialysis initiation and growing evidence of the clinical consequences of PEW which include the risk of death, hospitalization and clinical conditions such as infections. We reviewed the association of PEW and the malnutrition characteristics indicative of PEW on CKD progression. Studies show the association between low serum albumin levels, low BMI, and diets with inadequate dietary energy and protein intake and CKD progression. Limited studies suggest low muscle mass impacts CKD progression. Optimizing nutrition by dietary management, including a moderately low protein (0.6-0.8 g/kg/day) and plant-based (>50% of protein source, known as PLADO) diet and as needed with supplementation [e.g. during acute kidney injury (AKI) event] administrated orally, enterally, or parenterally are the basis for the prevention and treatment of PEW in CKD and delaying CKD progression. Furthermore, other therapeutic methods such as treating or avoiding comorbidities and AKI, ensuring appropriate exercise and incremental transition to dialysis treatment may help ameliorate and prevent PEW development in CKD patients. Using tailored precision nutrition approaches and nutritional supplementation with or without other beneficial strategies may help prevent and treat PEW and its consequent occurrence of CKD progression.",Narasaki Y; Rhee CM; Kalantar-Zadeh K; Rastegar M,Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39611279/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39283705,A Systematic Review of the Effect of Gene-Lifestyle Interactions on Metabolic-Disease-Related Traits in South Asian Populations.,"Recent data from the South Asian subregion have raised concern about the dramatic increase in the prevalence of metabolic diseases, which are influenced by genetic and lifestyle factors. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the contemporary evidence for the effect of gene-lifestyle interactions on metabolic outcomes in this population. PubMed, Web of Science, and SCOPUS databases were searched up until March 2023 for observational and intervention studies investigating the interaction between genetic variants and lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity on obesity and type 2 diabetes traits. Of the 14 783 publications extracted, 15 were deemed eligible for inclusion in this study. Data extraction was carried out independently by 3 investigators. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Appraisal Tool for Cross-Sectional Studies (AXIS), the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I), and the methodological quality score for nutrigenetics studies. Using a narrative synthesis approach, the findings were presented in textual and tabular format. Together, studies from India (n = 8), Pakistan (n = 3), Sri Lanka (n = 1), and the South Asian diaspora in Singapore and Canada (n = 3) reported 543 gene-lifestyle interactions, of which 132 (∼24%) were statistically significant. These results were related to the effects of the interaction of genetic factors with physical inactivity, poor sleep habits, smoking, and dietary intake of carbohydrates, protein, and fat on the risk of metabolic disease in this population. The findings of this systematic review provide evidence of gene-lifestyle interactions impacting metabolic traits within the South Asian population. However, the lack of replication and correction for multiple testing and the small sample size of the included studies may limit the conclusiveness of the evidence.

38956322,Towards nutrition with precision: unlocking biomarkers as dietary assessment tools.,"Precision nutrition requires precise tools to monitor dietary habits. Yet current dietary assessment instruments are subjective, limiting our understanding of the causal relationships between diet and health. Biomarkers of food intake (BFIs) hold promise to increase the objectivity and accuracy of dietary assessment, enabling adjustment for compliance and misreporting. Here, we update current concepts and provide a comprehensive overview of BFIs measured in urine and blood. We rank BFIs based on a four-level utility scale to guide selection and identify combinations of BFIs that specifically reflect complex food intakes, making them applicable as dietary instruments. We discuss the main challenges in biomarker development and illustrate key solutions for the application of BFIs in human studies, highlighting different strategies for selecting and combining BFIs to support specific study designs. Finally, we present a roadmap for BFI development and implementation to leverage current knowledge and enable precision in nutrition research.",Cuparencu C; Bulmuş-Tüccar T; Stanstrup J; La Barbera G; Roager HM; Dragsted LO,Nature metabolism,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38956322/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38428435,Transforming the cardiometabolic disease landscape: Multimodal AI-powered approaches in prevention and management.,"The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized various scientific fields, particularly in medicine, where it has enabled the modeling of complex relationships from massive datasets. Initially, AI algorithms focused on improved interpretation of diagnostic studies such as chest X-rays and electrocardiograms in addition to predicting patient outcomes and future disease onset. However, AI has evolved with the introduction of transformer models, allowing analysis of the diverse, multimodal data sources existing in medicine today. Multimodal AI holds great promise in more accurate disease risk assessment and stratification as well as optimizing the key driving factors in cardiometabolic disease: blood pressure, sleep, stress, glucose control, weight, nutrition, and physical activity. In this article we outline the current state of medical AI in cardiometabolic disease, highlighting the potential of multimodal AI to augment personalized prevention and treatment strategies in cardiometabolic disease.",Muse ED; Topol EJ,Cell metabolism,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38428435/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38316343,Potential Mechanisms of Precision Nutrition-Based Interventions for Managing Obesity.,"Precision nutrition (PN) considers multiple individual-level and environmental characteristics or variables to better inform dietary strategies and interventions for optimizing health, including managing obesity and metabolic disorders. Here, we review the evidence on potential mechanisms-including ones to identify individuals most likely to respond-that can be leveraged in the development of PN interventions addressing obesity. We conducted a review of the literature and included laboratory, animal, and human studies evaluating biochemical and genetic data, completed and ongoing clinical trials, and public programs in this review. Our analysis describes the potential mechanisms related to 6 domains including genetic predisposition, circadian rhythms, physical activity and sedentary behavior, metabolomics, the gut microbiome, and behavioral and socioeconomic characteristics, i.e., the factors that can be leveraged to design PN-based interventions to prevent and treat obesity-related outcomes such as weight loss or metabolic health as laid out by the NIH 2030 Strategic Plan for Nutrition Research. For example, single nucleotide polymorphisms can modify responses to certain dietary interventions, and epigenetic modulation of obesity risk via physical activity patterns and macronutrient intake have also been demonstrated. Additionally, we identified limitations including questions of equitable implementation across a limited number of clinical trials. These include the limited ability of current PN interventions to address systemic influences such as supply chains and food distribution, healthcare systems, racial or cultural inequities, and economic disparities, particularly when designing and implementing PN interventions in low- and middle-income communities. PN has the potential to help manage obesity by addressing intra- and inter-individual variation as well as context, as opposed to ""one-size fits all"" approaches though there is limited clinical trial evidence to date.",Mehta NH; Huey SL; Kuriyan R; Peña-Rosas JP; Finkelstein JL; Kashyap S; Mehta S,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38316343/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38281958,A genomics perspective of personalized prevention and management of obesity.,"This review discusses the landscape of personalized prevention and management of obesity from a nutrigenetics perspective. Focusing on macronutrient tailoring, we discuss the impact of genetic variation on responses to carbohydrate, lipid, protein, and fiber consumption. Our bioinformatic analysis of genomic variants guiding macronutrient intake revealed enrichment of pathways associated with circadian rhythm, melatonin metabolism, cholesterol and lipoprotein remodeling and PPAR signaling as potential targets of macronutrients for the management of obesity in relevant genetic backgrounds. Notably, our data-based in silico predictions suggest the potential of repurposing the SYK inhibitor fostamatinib for obesity treatment in relevant genetic profiles. In addition to dietary considerations, we address genetic variations guiding lifestyle changes in weight management, including exercise and chrononutrition. Finally, we emphasize the need for a refined understanding and expanded research into the complex genetic landscape underlying obesity and its management.",Gkouskou KK; Grammatikopoulou MG; Lazou E; Vasilogiannakopoulou T; Sanoudou D; Eliopoulos AG,Human genomics,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38281958/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38143595,Beyond Diet and Exercise: The Impact of Gut Microbiota on Control of Obesity.,"Obesity, a widespread health concern characterized by the excessive accumulation of body fat, is a complex condition influenced by genetics, environment, and social determinants. Recent research has increasingly focused on the role of gut microbiota in obesity, highlighting its pivotal involvement in various metabolic processes. The gut microbiota, a diverse community of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, interacts with the host in a myriad of ways, impacting energy metabolism, appetite regulation, inflammation, and the gut-brain axis. Dietary choices significantly shape the gut microbiota, with diets high in fat and carbohydrates promoting the growth of harmful bacteria while reducing beneficial microbes. Lifestyle factors, like physical activity and smoking, also influence gut microbiota composition. Antibiotics and medications can disrupt microbial diversity, potentially contributing to obesity. Early-life experiences, including maternal obesity during pregnancy, play a vital role in the developmental origins of obesity. Therapeutic interventions targeting the gut microbiota, including prebiotics, probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, bacterial consortium therapy, and precision nutrition, offer promising avenues for reshaping the gut microbiota and positively influencing weight regulation and metabolic health. Clinical applications of microbiota-based therapies are on the horizon, with potential implications for personalized treatments and condition-based interventions. Emerging technologies, such as next-generation sequencing and advanced bioinformatics, empower researchers to identify specific target species for microbiota-based therapeutics, opening new possibilities in healthcare. Despite the promising outlook, microbiota-based therapies face challenges related to microbial selection, safety, and regulatory issues. However, with ongoing research and advances in the field, these challenges can be addressed to unlock the full potential of microbiota-based interventions.",Kamal FD; Dagar M; Reza T; Karim Mandokhail A; Bakht D; Shahzad MW; Silloca-Cabana EO; Mohsin SN; Chilla SP; Bokhari SFH,Cureus,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38143595/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37558243,Temporal patterns in taste sensitivity.,"Individuals vary in their ability to taste, and some individuals are more sensitive to certain tastes than others. Taste sensitivity is a predictor of various factors, such as diet, eating behavior, appetite regulation, and overall health. Furthermore, taste sensitivity can fluctuate within an individual over short to long periods of time: for example, in daily (diurnal) cycles, monthly (menstrual) cycles (in females), and yearly (seasonal) cycles. Understanding these temporal patterns is important for understanding individual eating habits and food preferences, particularly in the context of personalized and precision nutrition. This review provides a summary of the literature on taste sensitivity patterns across 3 temporal dimensions: daily, monthly, and yearly. Good evidence for diurnal patterns has been observed for sweet taste and fat taste, although the evidence is limited to rodent studies for the latter. Obese populations showed limited variation to sweet and fat taste sensitivities over a day, with limited variation in sweet taste sensitivity being linked to insulin resistance. There were mixed observations of temporal variation in sensitivity to sour and umami tastes, and there were no patterns in sensitivity to bitter taste. Menstrual patterns in sweet taste sensitivity were consistent with patterns in food intake. Other taste modality investigations had mixed findings that had little agreement across studies. Hormonal changes in females influence taste sensitivity to some degree, although the overall patterns are unclear. Seasonal patterns have been less well studied, but there is weak evidence that sweet, salty, and bitter taste sensitivities change across seasons. Differences in seasonal taste patterns have been observed in subgroups susceptible to mental health disorders, requiring further investigation. Patterns of taste sensitivity are evident across multiple temporal dimensions, and more research is needed to determine the influence of these patterns on food intake. Dysregulation of these patterns may also be a marker of certain diseases or health conditions, warranting further investigation. Notably, the alimentary tastes (umami, fat, and carbohydrate) are underrepresented in this research area and require additional investigation.",Costanzo A,Nutrition reviews,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37558243/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37458175,"Nutrition strategies to counteract sarcopenia: a focus on protein, LC <i>n</i>-3 PUFA and precision nutrition.","Diminished skeletal muscle strength and size, termed sarcopenia, contributes substantially to physical disability, falls, dependence and reduced quality of life among older people. Physical activity and nutrition are the cornerstones of sarcopenia prevention and treatment. The optimal daily protein intake required to preserve muscle mass and function among older adults is a topic of intense scientific debate. Older adults require protein intakes about 67 % higher than their younger counterparts to maximally stimulate postprandial muscle protein synthesis rates. In addition, evidence suggests a possible benefit of increasing protein intake above the population reference intake (0⋅83 g/kg/d) on lean mass and, when combined with exercise training, muscle strength. In addition to protein quantity, protein quality, the pattern of protein intake over the day and specific amino acids (i.e. leucine) represent key considerations. Long-chain <i>n</i>-3 PUFA (LC <i>n-</i>3 PUFA) supplementation has been shown to enhance muscle protein synthesis rates, increase muscle mass and function and augment adaptations to resistance training in older adults. Yet, these effects are not consistent across all studies. Emerging evidence indicates that an older person's dietary, phenotypic and behavioural characteristics may modulate the efficacy of protein and LC <i>n</i>-3 PUFA interventions for promoting improvements in muscle mass and function, highlighting the potential inadequacy of a 'one-size-fits-all' approach. The application of personalised or precision nutrition to sarcopenia represents an exciting and highly novel field of research with the potential to help resolve inconsistencies in the literature and improve the efficacy of dietary interventions for sarcopenia.",Murphy CH; McCarthy SN; Roche HM,The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37458175/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37432488,Effect of High Fat Diet on Disease Development of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and Lifestyle Intervention Strategies.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent endocrine and metabolic disorder that affects premenopausal women. The etiology of PCOS is multifaceted, involving various genetic and epigenetic factors, hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian dysfunction, androgen excess, insulin resistance, and adipose-related mechanisms. High-fat diets (HFDs) has been linked to the development of metabolic disorders and weight gain, exacerbating obesity and impairing the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. This results in increased insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and the release of inflammatory adipokines, leading to heightened fat synthesis and reduced fat breakdown, thereby worsening the metabolic and reproductive consequences of PCOS. Effective management of PCOS requires lifestyle interventions such as dietary modifications, weight loss, physical activity, and psychological well-being, as well as medical or surgical interventions in some cases. This article systematically examines the pathological basis of PCOS and the influence of HFDs on its development, with the aim of raising awareness of the connection between diet and reproductive health, providing a robust approach to lifestyle interventions, and serving as a reference for the development of targeted drug treatments.",Han Y; Wu H; Sun S; Zhao R; Deng Y; Zeng S; Chen J,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37432488/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37335395,Behavioral and Psychological Factors Affecting Weight Loss Success.,"There is a large variability between individuals in the weight loss response to any given diet treatment, which fuels interest into personalized or precision nutrition. Although most efforts are directed toward identifying biological or metabolic factors, several behavioral and psychological factors can also be responsible for some of this interindividual variability. There are many factors that can influence the response to dietary weight loss interventions, including factors related to eating behavior (emotional eating, disinhibition, restraint, perceived stress), behaviors and societal norms related to age and sex, psychological and personal factors (motivation, self-efficacy, locus of control, self-concept), and major life events. The success of a weight loss intervention can be influenced by many psychological and behavioral constructs and not merely by physiological factors such as biology and genetics. These factors are difficult to capture accurately and are often overlooked. Future weight loss studies should consider assessing such factors to better understand the underlying reasons for the large interindividual variability to weight loss therapy.",Pigsborg K; Kalea AZ; De Dominicis S; Magkos F,Current obesity reports,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37335395/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37334485,Cultural adaptations and tailoring of public health nutrition interventions in Indigenous peoples and ethnic minority groups: opportunities for personalised and precision nutrition.,"Indigenous peoples and ethnic minority groups often experience poor diet quality and poor health outcomes. Such inequities may be partially due to nutrition interventions not meeting the unique cultural and linguistic needs of these population groups, which could be achieved using co-creation and/or personalised approaches. Cultural adaptation or tailoring of nutrition interventions has shown promise in improving some aspects of dietary intake, but this requires careful consideration to ensure it does not inadvertently exacerbate dietary inequities. The aim of this narrative review was to examine examples of cultural adaptations and/or tailoring of public health nutrition interventions that improved the dietary intake and to consider implications for the optimal design and implementation of personalised and precision nutrition interventions. This review identified six examples of cultural adaptation and/or tailoring of public health nutrition intervention in Indigenous peoples and ethnic minority groups across Australia, Canada and the US. All studies used deep socio-cultural adaptations, such as the use of Indigenous storytelling, and many included surface-level adaptations, such as the use of culturally appropriate imagery in intervention materials. However, it was not possible to attribute any improvements in dietary intake to cultural adaptation and/or tailoring <i>per se</i>, and the minimal reporting on the nature of adaptations limited our ability to determine whether the interventions used true co-creation to design content or were adapted from existing interventions. Findings from this review outline opportunities for personalised nutrition interventions to use co-creation practices to design, deliver and implement interventions in collaboration with Indigenous and ethnic minority groups.",Livingstone KM; Love P; Mathers JC; Kirkpatrick SI; Olstad DL,The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37334485/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36369942,Sialic acid and food allergies: The link between nutrition and immunology.,"Food allergies (FA), a major public health problem recognized by the World Health Organization, affect an estimated 3%-10% of adults and 8% of children worldwide. However, effective treatments for FA are still lacking. Recent advances in glycoimmunology have demonstrated the great potential of sialic acids (SAs) in the treatment of FA. SAs are a group of nine-carbon α-ketoacids usually linked to glycoproteins and glycolipids as terminal glycans. They play an essential role in modulating immune responses and may be an effective target for FA intervention. As exogenous food components, sialylated polysaccharides have anti-FA effects. In contrast, as endogenous components, SAs on immunoglobulin E and immune cell surfaces contribute to the pathogenesis of FA. Given the lack of comprehensive information on the effects of SAs on FA, we reviewed the roles of endogenous and exogenous SAs in the pathogenesis and treatment of FA. In addition, we considered the structure-function relationship of SAs to provide a theoretical basis for the development of SA-based FA treatments.",Liu G; Hao M; Zeng B; Liu M; Wang J; Sun S; Liu C; Huilian C,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36369942/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35639552,Comparison of dietary and physical activity behaviors in women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 39 471 women.,"Lifestyle (dietary and/or physical activity [PA]) modification is recommended as first-line therapy to manage polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Current recommendations are based on healthy lifestyle practices for the general public since evidence for unique lifestyle approaches in PCOS is limited and low quality. We aimed to synthesize evidence on dietary and PA behaviors between women with PCOS and those without PCOS. Primary outcomes were overall diet quality, total energy intake and total PA, and secondary outcomes included macronutrients, micronutrients, food groups, foods, glycemic indices, sedentary time and sitting levels. We conducted this work to identify any unique lifestyle behaviors in women with PCOS that could underlie the propensity of weight gain and obesity in PCOS and be targeted for precision nutrition and PA interventions. These findings could be used to inform future practice recommendations and research that more effectively address complications (weight gain, obesity, diabetes, infertility, cardiovascular disease and mental health) in this high-risk population. Databases of MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus and CINAHL were searched until 15 February 2022 to identify observational studies documenting dietary and PA behaviors between women with PCOS and without PCOS (Controls). Studies on children, adolescents (&lt;18 years), pregnant or menopausal-aged women (&gt;50 years) were excluded. Data were pooled by random-effects models and expressed as (standardized) mean differences (MD) and 95% CIs. The risk of bias was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). Fifty-four studies (N = 39 471 participants; [n = 8736 PCOS; 30 735 Controls]) were eligible (96%; [52/54] NOS scores ≥ 7). Women with PCOS had higher cholesterol (MD: 12.78, 95% CI: 1.48 to 24.08 mg/day; P = 0.03; I2 = 19%), lower magnesium (MD: -21.46, 95% CI: -41.03 to -1.91 mg/day; P = 0.03; I2 = 76%), and a tendency for lower zinc (MD: -1.08, 95% CI: -2.19 to -0.03 mg/day; P = 0.05; I2 = 96%) intake, despite lower alcohol consumption (MD: -0.95, 95% CI: -1.67 to 0.22 g/day; P = 0.02; I2 = 0%) versus Controls. Also, women with PCOS had lower total PA (standardized mean difference: -0.38, 95% CI: -0.72 to 0.03; P = 0.03; I2 = 98%). Conversely, energy, macronutrients (carbohydrate, fat, protein, fiber), micronutrients (folic acid, iron, calcium, sodium), glycemic index and glycemic load were similar (all: P ≥ 0.06). Most eligible studies reported lower total adherence to healthy eating patterns or poorer consumption of major food groups (grains, fruits, vegetables, proteins, seeds, nuts, dairy) in women with PCOS, as described narratively since variable study methodology did not permit meta-analyses. Collective evidence supports that women with PCOS have a lower overall diet quality, poorer dietary intakes (higher cholesterol, lower magnesium and zinc) and lower total PA, despite lower alcohol consumption versus those without PCOS. Considerable heterogeneity among studies reinforces the need for research to address any relative contributions of other factors (e.g. genetic, metabolic or sociodemographic) to the observed differences. These clarifications may contribute to future evidence-based guideline recommendations on monitoring and managing PCOS in the era of precision lifestyle medicine.",Kazemi M; Kim JY; Wan C; Xiong JD; Michalak J; Xavier IB; Ganga K; Tay CT; Grieger JA; Parry SA; Moran LJ; Lujan ME,Human reproduction update,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35639552/,0,1,0,1,0,0
35612976,Contribution of Biological Age-Predictive Biomarkers to Nutrition Research: A Systematic Review of the Current Evidence and Implications for Future Research and Clinical Practice.,"The global population is living longer; however, not everyone ages at the same rate with regard to their physical and cognitive abilities and their vulnerability to certain diseases and death. This review aimed to synthesize the contribution of biological age-predictive biomarkers to nutrition research and highlight the implications for future research and clinical practice. MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Cochrane CENTRAL were systematically searched on 30 September 2021 for randomized controlled trials and cross-sectional studies examining the association between nutrition and biological age in older adults reporting on genetic, clinical, or molecular biomarkers of biological aging. Cochrane's ROB 2 and ROBINS-I were used to assess the quality of included studies. Synthesis was undertaken narratively. Of 1245 records identified from the search, 13 studies from 8 countries and territories, involving 5043 participants, were included. Seven studies assessed associations between nutrient food intake and telomere attrition, reporting protective effects for branched-chain amino acids, calcium and vitamin D, and a diet of a lower inflammatory index; whereas they found shorter telomeres in people consuming more processed foods and arachidonic acid and other proinflammatory compounds. Five studies examined the associations between plasma nutrition biomarkers and cognitive function, and found a protective effect for HDL cholesterol, lycopene, carotenoids, ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids, and vitamins B, C, D, and E; whereas trans fatty acids and fibrinogen correlated with a decline in cognitive function. One study used Horvath's clock and reported the epigenetic rejuvenation effect of a Mediterranean diet. In conclusion, biological aging was negatively associated with an anti-inflammatory diet. However, a few studies did not control for the confounding effect of other lifestyle factors. Future research should address this and also assess the synergistic effect of different nutrients, their combinations, and evaluate their dose-response relations. Nutrition practice can incorporate updated screening procedures for older people that include relevant biological aging nutrition markers, leading to anti-aging precision nutrition therapy. The methodology of this systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021288122).",Siopis G; Porter J,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35612976/,0,1,0,0,0,0
35174475,The Niche of n-of-1 Trials in Precision Medicine for Weight Loss and Obesity Treatment: Back to the Future.,"The n-of-1 clinical trials are considered the epitome of individualized health care. They are employed to address differences in treatment response and adverse events between patients, in a comparative effectiveness manner, extending beyond the delivery of horizontal recommendations for all. The n-of-1 design has been applied to deliver precision exercise interventions, through eHealth and mHealth technologies. Regarding personalized and precision medical nutrition therapy, few trials have implemented dietary manipulations and one series of n-of-1 trials has applied comprehensive genetic data to improve body weight. With regard to anti-obesity medication, pharmacogenetic data could be applied using the n-of-1 trial design, although none have been implemented yet. The n-of-1 clinical trials consist of the only tool for the delivery of evidence-based, personalized obesity treatment (lifestyle and pharmacotherapy), reducing non-responders, while tailoring the best intervention to each patient, through ""trial and error"". Their application is expected to improve obesity treatment and mitigate the epidemic.",Grammatikopoulou MG; Gkouskou KK; Gkiouras K; Bogdanos DP; Eliopoulos AG; Goulis DG,Current nutrition reports,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35174475/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35108358,A Systematic Review of Literature on the Representation of Racial and Ethnic Minority Groups in Clinical Nutrition Interventions.,"The racial and ethnic disparities in diet-related chronic diseases are major concerns. This systematic review examines the extent to which diet-induced changes in health outcomes, such as cardiometabolic, inflammation, cancer, bone health, and kidney function outcomes, etc., have been reported and discussed by race or ethnicity in randomized trials with 2 or more diet arms that recruited both minority and non-Hispanic White groups. Databases (i.e., PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) were searched up to August 2021. Thirty-four studies that discussed effects of defined dietary interventions on health outcomes by racial or ethnic minority group compared with non-Hispanic Whites were included in the systematic review (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021229256). Acute trials and those with 1 diet arm that accounted for race or ethnicity in their analyses and studies that focused on a single racial or ethnic group were discussed separately. Most studies were conducted in Black compared with White adults testing effects of energy restriction, macronutrient modification, sodium reduction, or variations of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on cardiometabolic outcomes. There was limited focus on other minority groups. Evidence suggests greater blood pressure reduction for Black adults compared with Whites particularly with DASH (or similar) diets. Overall, there was limited consideration for group-specific eating patterns and diet acceptability. Overall risk of bias was low. With emerging precision nutrition initiatives that aim to optimize metabolic responses in population subgroups through tailored approaches, it is imperative to ensure adequate representation of racial and ethnic subgroups for addressing health disparities. Factors that help explain variability in responses such as socioecological context should be included and adequately powered. Given the racial and ethnic disparities in chronic diseases, studying the adoption, maintenance, and effectiveness of dietary interventions on health outcomes among different groups is critical for developing approaches that can mitigate diet-related health disparities.",Dhillon J; Jacobs AG; Ortiz S; Diaz Rios LK,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35108358/,0,1,0,0,0,0
35025088,Metabotyping for Precision Nutrition and Weight Management: Hype or Hope?,"Precision nutrition requires a solid understanding of the factors that determine individual responses to dietary treatment. We review the current state of knowledge in identifying human metabotypes - based on circulating biomarkers - that can predict weight loss or other relevant physiological outcomes in response to diet treatment. Not many studies have been conducted in this area and the ones identified here are heterogeneous in design and methodology, and therefore difficult to synthesize and draw conclusions. The basis of the creation of metabotypes varies widely, from using thresholds for a single metabolite to using complex algorithms to generate multi-component constructs that include metabolite and genetic information. Furthermore, available studies are a mix of hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating studies, and most of them lack experimental testing in human trials. Although this field of research is still in its infancy, precision-based dietary intervention strategies focusing on the metabotype group level hold promise for designing more effective dietary treatments for obesity.",Pigsborg K; Magkos F,Current nutrition reports,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35025088/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34970584,"Multiomics Approach to Precision Sports Nutrition: Limits, Challenges, and Possibilities.","Most sports nutrition guidelines are based on group average responses and professional opinion. Precision nutrition for athletes aims to improve the individualization of nutrition practices to optimize long-term performance and health. This is a 2-step process that first involves the acquisition of individual-specific, science-based information using a variety of sources including lifestyle and medical histories, dietary assessment, physiological assessments from the performance lab and wearable sensors, and multiomics data from blood, urine, saliva, and stool samples. The second step consists of the delivery of science-based nutrition advice, behavior change support, and the monitoring of health and performance efficacy and benefits relative to cost. Individuals vary widely in the way they respond to exercise and nutritional interventions, and understanding why this metabolic heterogeneity exists is critical for further advances in precision nutrition. Another major challenge is the development of evidence-based individualized nutrition recommendations that are embraced and efficacious for athletes seeking the most effective enhancement of performance, metabolic recovery, and health. At this time precision sports nutrition is an emerging discipline that will require continued technological and scientific advances before this approach becomes accurate and practical for athletes and fitness enthusiasts at the small group or individual level.

34836203,A Multidisciplinary Perspective of Ultra-Processed Foods and Associated Food Processing Technologies: A View of the Sustainable Road Ahead.,"Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are negatively perceived by part of the scientific community, the public, and policymakers alike, to the extent they are sometimes referred to as not ""real food"". Many observational surveys have linked consumption of UPFs to adverse health outcomes. This narrative synthesis and scientific reappraisal of available evidence aims to: (i) critically evaluate UPF-related scientific literature on diet and disease and identify possible research gaps or biases in the interpretation of data; (ii) emphasize the innovative potential of various processing technologies that can lead to modifications of the food matrix with beneficial health effects; (iii) highlight the possible links between processing, sustainability and circular economy through the valorisation of by-products; and (iv) delineate the conceptual parameters of new paradigms in food evaluation and classification systems. Although greater consumption of UPFs has been associated with obesity, unfavorable cardiometabolic risk factor profiles, and increased risk for non-communicable diseases, whether specific food processing techniques leading to ultra-processed formulations are responsible for the observed links between UPFs and various health outcomes remains elusive and far from being understood. Evolving technologies can be used in the context of sustainable valorisation of food processing by-products to create novel, low-cost UPFs with improved nutritional value and health potential. New paradigms of food evaluation and assessment should be funded and developed on several novel pillars-enginomics, signalling, and precision nutrition-taking advantage of available digital technologies and artificial intelligence. Research is needed to generate required scientific knowledge to either expand the current or create new food evaluation and classification systems, incorporating processing aspects that may have a significant impact on health and wellness, together with factors related to the personalization of foods and diets, while not neglecting recycling and sustainability aspects.

34574696,Hypothesizing Nutrigenomic-Based Precision Anti-Obesity Treatment and Prophylaxis: Should We Be Targeting Sarcopenia Induced Brain Dysfunction?,"<b>Background:</b> The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates a total obesity rate of 30% for 12 states and a 20% obesity rate nationwide. The obesity epidemic continues to increase in spite of preventative measures undertaken worldwide. Pharmacological treatments promise to reduce total fat mass. However, medications may have significant side effects and can be potentially fatal. <b>Data Retrieval</b>: This brief review, based on a PUBMED search of the key terms ""Obesity"" and"" Sarcopenia,"" will present evidence to corroborate the existence of Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) in obesity and the involvement of catecholaminergic pathways in substance seeking behavior, particularly as it relates to carbohydrates cravings. <b>Expert Opinion:</b> The genetic basis and future genetic testing of children for risk of aberrant generalized craving behavior are considered a prevention method. Here we present evidence supporting the use of precursor amino acid therapy and modulation of enkephalinase, <b><i>MOA</i></b>, and <b><i>COMT</i></b> inhibition in key brain regions. Such treatments manifest in improved levels of dopamine/norepinephrine, GABA, serotonin, and enkephalins. We also present evidence substantiating insulin sensitivity enhancement via Chromium salts, which affect dopamine neuronal synthesis regulation. We believe our unique combination of natural ingredients will influence many pathways leading to the promotion of well-being and normal healthy metabolic functioning. Sarcopenia has been shown to reduce angiogenesis and possible cerebral blood flow. Exercise seems to provide a significant benefit to overcome this obesity-promoting loss of muscle density. <b>Conclusion:</b> Utilization of proposed nutrigenomic formulae based on coupling genetic obesity risk testing promotes generalized anti-craving of carbohydrates and can inhibit carbohydrate bingeing, inducing significant healthy fat loss and relapse prevention.",Blum K; Gold MS; Llanos-Gomez L; Jalali R; Thanos PK; Bowirrat A; Downs WB; Bagchi D; Braverman ER; Baron D; Roy AK; Badgaiyan RD,International journal of environmental research and public health,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34574696/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34462020,The Mediterranean diet and physical activity: better together than apart for the prevention of premature mortality.,"Diet and physical activity (PA) have been studied extensively in epidemiology as single or combined lifestyle factors; however, their interaction has not been studied thoroughly. Studying potential synergisms between lifestyle components with a comprehensive interaction analysis, including additive measures of interaction, provides key insights into the nature of their joint effect and helps target interventions more effectively. First, a comprehensive review was conducted to assess the potential research gap regarding reported interaction analyses conducted in studies assessing the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) in combination with PA on all-cause mortality. Thereafter, we prospectively assessed the joint association of the MedDiet with PA on all-cause mortality in the <i>Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra</i> (SUN) cohort, followed by both multiplicative and additive interaction analyses. The conjoint effect of low adherence to the MedDiet and low PA observed an increased risk greater than the individual risk factors, suggesting a potential additive interaction or synergism between both exposures, with relative risk due to interaction (RERI) and (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI)) = 0·46 (–0·83 to 1·75) and attributable proportion (95 % CI) due to interaction of 36 % (–0·62, 1·34). No multiplicative interaction was detected. Studying interactions between lifestyle factors, such as the MedDiet and PA, is particularly relevant given the current research gaps in studying the complexities of combined aspects of lifestyle in comparison with isolated behaviours. Our findings underline the important public health message of adhering to both the MedDiet and PA for the prevention of premature mortality.",Hershey MS; Martínez-González MÁ; Álvarez-Álvarez I; Martínez Hernández JA; Ruiz-Canela M,The British journal of nutrition,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34462020/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34422879,Memorable Food: Fighting Age-Related Neurodegeneration by Precision Nutrition.,"Healthcare systems worldwide are seriously challenged by a rising prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), which mostly, but not exclusively, affect the ever-growing population of the elderly. The most known neurodegenerative diseases are Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but some viral infections of the brain and traumatic brain injury may also cause NDD. Typical for NDD are the malfunctioning of neurons and their irreversible loss, which often progress irreversibly to dementia and ultimately to death. Numerous factors are involved in the pathogenesis of NDD: genetic variability, epigenetic changes, extent of oxidative/nitrosative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and DNA damage. The complex interplay of all the above-mentioned factors may be a fingerprint of neurodegeneration, with different diseases being affected to different extents by particular factors. There is a voluminous body of evidence showing the benefits of regular exercise to brain health and cognitive functions. Moreover, the importance of a healthy diet, balanced in macro- and micro-nutrients, in preventing neurodegeneration and slowing down a progression to full-blown disease is evident. Individuals affected by NDD almost inevitably have low-grade inflammation and anomalies in lipid metabolism. Metabolic and lipid profiles in NDD can be improved by the Mediterranean diet. Many studies have associated the Mediterranean diet with a decreased risk of dementia and AD, but a cause-and-effect relationship has not been deduced. Studies with caloric restriction showed neuroprotective effects in animal models, but the results in humans are inconsistent. The pathologies of NDD are complex and there is a great inter-individual (epi)genetic variance within any population. Furthermore, the gut microbiome, being deeply involved in nutrient uptake and lipid metabolism, also represents a pillar of the gut microbiome-brain axis and is linked with the pathogenesis of NDD. Numerous studies on the role of different micronutrients (omega-3 fatty acids, bioactive polyphenols from fruit and medicinal plants) in the prevention, prediction, and treatment of NDD have been conducted, but we are still far away from a personalized diet plan for individual NDD patients. For this to be realized, large-scale cohorts that would include the precise monitoring of food intake, mapping of genetic variants, epigenetic data, microbiome studies, and metabolome, lipidome, and transcriptome data are needed.",Milošević M; Arsić A; Cvetković Z; Vučić V,Frontiers in nutrition,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34422879/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33333960,Miracle Berry as a Potential Supplement in the Control of Metabolic Risk Factors in Cancer.,"The increased incidence of chronic diseases related to altered metabolism has become a social and medical concern worldwide. Cancer is a chronic and multifactorial disease for which, together with genetic factors, environmental factors are crucial. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), up to one third of cancer-related deaths could be prevented by modifying risk factors associated with lifestyle, including diet and exercise. Obesity increases the risk of cancer due to the promotion of low-grade chronic inflammation and systemic metabolic oxidative stress. The effective control of metabolic parameters, for example, controlling glucose, lipid levels, and blood pressure, and maintaining a low grade of chronic inflammation and oxidative stress might represent a specific and mechanistic approach against cancer initiation and progression. Miracle berry (MB) (<i>Synsepalum dulcificum)</i> is an indigenous fruit whose small, ellipsoid, and bright red berries have been described to transform a sour taste into a sweet one. MB is rich in terpenoids, phenolic compounds, and flavonoids, which are responsible for their described antioxidant activities. Moreover, MB has been reported to ameliorate insulin resistance and inhibit cancer cell proliferation and malignant transformation in vitro. Herein, we briefly summarize the current knowledge of MB to provide a scientific basis for its potential use as a supplement in the management of chronic diseases related to altered metabolism, including obesity and insulin resistance, which are well-known risk factors in cancer. First, we introduce cancer as a metabolic disease, highlighting the impact of systemic metabolic alterations, such as obesity and insulin resistance, in cancer initiation and progression. Next, as oxidative stress is closely associated with metabolic stress, we also evaluate the effect of phytochemicals in managing oxidative stress and its relationship with cancer. Finally, we summarize the main biological activities described for MB-derived extracts with a special focus on the ability of miraculin to transform a sour taste into a sweet one through its interaction with the sweet taste receptors. The identification of sweet taste receptors at the gastrointestinal level, with effects on the secretion of enterohormones, may provide an additional tool for managing chronic diseases, including cancer.",Gómez de Cedrón M; Wagner S; Reguero M; Menéndez-Rey A; de Molina AR,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33333960/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33231704,"Epigenetic signatures underlying inflammation: an interplay of nutrition, physical activity, metabolic diseases, and environmental factors for personalized nutrition.","Emerging translational evidence suggests that epigenetic alterations (DNA methylation, miRNA expression, and histone modifications) occur after external stimuli and may contribute to exacerbated inflammation and the risk of suffering several diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurological disorders. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the harmful effects of high-fat/high-sugar diets, micronutrient deficiencies (folate, manganese, and carotenoids), obesity and associated complications, bacterial/viral infections, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, sleep deprivation, chronic stress, air pollution, and chemical exposure on inflammation through epigenetic mechanisms. Additionally, the epigenetic phenomena underlying the anti-inflammatory potential of caloric restriction, n-3 PUFA, Mediterranean diet, vitamin D, zinc, polyphenols (i.e., resveratrol, gallic acid, epicatechin, luteolin, curcumin), and the role of systematic exercise are discussed. Original and review articles encompassing epigenetics and inflammation were screened from major databases (including PubMed, Medline, Science Direct, Scopus, etc.) and analyzed for the writing of the review paper. Although caution should be exercised, research on epigenetic mechanisms is contributing to understand pathological processes involving inflammatory responses, the prediction of disease risk based on the epigenotype, as well as the putative design of therapeutic interventions targeting the epigenome.",Ramos-Lopez O; Milagro FI; Riezu-Boj JI; Martinez JA,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

31362802,Sex matters: a focus on the impact of biological sex on metabolomic profiles and dietary interventions.,"The metabolomic profile of a biofluid can be altered by dietary intake, exercise and disease processes and, thus provides an important tool for the study of many physiological processes. However, in addition to perturbation due to disease, the metabolomic profile of urine and plasma has also been shown to vary due to many intrinsic physiological factors such as age, sex, hormonal status and diurnal variation. Characterisation of this normal degree of variation in the metabolomic profiles of human biofluids is a necessary and important step in the development of metabolomics for use in nutrition-related research. The current review focuses on the impact of sex on the metabolomic profile. A number of studies have reported that sex impacts metabolites such as amino acids, lipids, sugars and keto acids. Furthermore, we examine the effect of the menstrual cycle on the metabolomic profile. Responses to dietary interventions can also differ between the sexes and highlighting this is important for the development of the field of precision nutrition.",Brennan L; Gibbons H,The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31362802/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30646166,Association of Levels of Physical Activity With Risk of Parkinson Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"The association between physical activity and the risk of Parkinson disease (PD) has been increasingly recognized. However, to our knowledge, a comprehensive assessment of the quantitative dose-response association between physical activity and PD risk has not been performed previously. To quantify the dose-response association between physical activity and the risk of developing PD. PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were systematically searched for peer-reviewed articles published through February 2018 reporting the association between physical activity and PD risk. Prospective studies that examined the association between physical activity and PD risk were included. Data were extracted independently by 2 investigators. Adjusted risk estimates were extracted and pooled using a random-effects model. The study adhered to Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) reporting guidelines. The main outcome was the incidence of PD diagnoses confirmed by the treating neurologists or the authoritative medical records. Eight prospective studies totaling 544 336 participants included 2192 patients with PD with a median (range) follow-up period of 12 (6.1-22.0) years were identified. A significantly reduced risk of PD was associated with the highest levels of either total physical activity (relative risk, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.68-0.91) or moderate to vigorous physical activity (relative risk, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58-0.87), with stronger associations among men than among women. In contrast, light physical activity was not associated with PD risk (relative risk, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.60-1.23). The dose-response analysis revealed that for each 10 metabolic equivalent of task-hours/week increase in total or moderate to vigorous physical activity, the risk of PD among men decreased by 10% and 17%, respectively. No linear dose-response association was found between physical activity and PD risk among women. This analysis revealed an inverse dose-response association between physical activity and PD risk among men; importantly, even moderate exercise was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of PD. Future studies with quantified measurements of physical activity will help identify the precise relative risk estimates for various levels of activity with respect to PD risk.",Fang X; Han D; Cheng Q; Zhang P; Zhao C; Min J; Wang F,JAMA network open,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30646166/,0,1,0,1,0,1
30070117,"[Nutrigenetics, nutrigenomics and Mediterranean diet: a new vision for gastronomy].","Both nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics are disciplines that form part of what is known as Nutritional Genomics, which, in the widest sense, provides the framework for integrating different omics with food and nutrition sciences. After decades of nutrigenetic and nutrigenomic studies, there is a large enough amount of knowledge to consider its application in so-called precision nutrition. This new discipline seeks to take into account the particular characteristics of the individual in order to provide the best diet for preventing or treating a disease. Omic markers are considered to be of importance to that personalization. There are many foods, nutrients and dietary patterns that have been researched in nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics, including the Mediterranean Diet pattern. Despite heterogeneity in defining the Mediterranean Diet, there are various studies that show that the Mediterranean Diet can interact with the genome, so reducing the risk of disease in the most genetically susceptible individuals. Likewise, several studies have recently been revealing the mechanisms through which the Mediterranean Diet may exercise this protective effect. Understanding genetic susceptibility, epigenetic mechanisms, the influence of the metabolome and other omics in more detail may be important in gastronomy, understood as the practice of selecting, cooking and eating food. This omic influence can not only be found in health-disease phenotypes, but also in food taste and smell perception and preferences for certain dishes. Considering all of these together may contribute to an increase in enjoying and at the same time pursuing healthy eating.",Corella D; Barragán R; Ordovás JM; Coltell Ó,Nutricion hospitalaria,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30070117/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28829397,Precision Nutrition: A Review of Personalized Nutritional Approaches for the Prevention and Management of Metabolic Syndrome.,"The translation of the growing increase of findings emerging from basic nutritional science into meaningful and clinically relevant dietary advices represents nowadays one of the main challenges of clinical nutrition. From nutrigenomics to deep phenotyping, many factors need to be taken into account in designing personalized and unbiased nutritional solutions for individuals or population sub-groups. Likewise, a concerted effort among basic, clinical scientists and health professionals will be needed to establish a comprehensive framework allowing the implementation of these new findings at the population level. In a world characterized by an overwhelming increase in the prevalence of obesity and associated metabolic disturbances, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, tailored nutrition prescription represents a promising approach for both the prevention and management of metabolic syndrome. This review aims to discuss recent works in the field of precision nutrition analyzing most relevant aspects affecting an individual response to lifestyle/nutritional interventions. Latest advances in the analysis and monitoring of dietary habits, food behaviors, physical activity/exercise and deep phenotyping will be discussed, as well as the relevance of novel applications of nutrigenomics, metabolomics and microbiota profiling. Recent findings in the development of precision nutrition are highlighted. Finally, results from published studies providing examples of new avenues to successfully implement innovative precision nutrition approaches will be reviewed.",de Toro-Martín J; Arsenault BJ; Després JP; Vohl MC,Nutrients,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28829397/,1,0,0,0,0,0
