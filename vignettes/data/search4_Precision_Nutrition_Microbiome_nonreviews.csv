41606844,A comparative study of the effects of high protein diets of soy and dairy on healthy aging by integrating multi-omics approaches.,"The global aging population necessitates optimal dietary protein strategies to mitigate age-related decline. However, few studies have linked soy and dairy protein intake to aging. This study investigated soy and dairy protein impacts on aging through epidemiological and animal analysis. Epidemiological data linked higher soy (not dairy) protein intake with slower biological aging. In animal experiments, the effects of 15 % and 30 % (protein energy supply ratios) casein diet (CPD) and soy protein diet (SPD) on aging-related health outcomes, aging phenotypes and its molecular mechanisms in middle-aged rats were explored. After 27 weeks feeding, compared to 15 % SPD, 30 % SPD significantly reduced adiposity, improved lipid profiles, enhanced memory and muscle performance, while 30 % CPD failed to demonstrate comparable improvements. Also, 30 % SPD alleviated liver and kidney impairment, decreased aging markers (p53, p16, p21) levels and SASP factors. Mechanically, 30 % SPD suppressed mTORC1 activation via decreased serum branched-chain amino acids. Furthermore, gut microbiota analysis revealed that SPD reshaped gut microbiota composition, enriched beneficial taxa such as Akkermansia and Duncaniella, and decreased pathogenic bacteria Fusobacterium, compared with CPD. Metabolomics further found that SPD specifically reduced phospholipid metabolites such as LPC 22:4-SN1, O-phosphatecholine, which were strongly correlated with behavioral index and SASP factors. Integrative analysis identified significant associations between SPD-enriched microbiota (Prevotellaceae_UCG-001 and Defluviitaleaceae_UCG-011) and metabolites and aging phenotypes. Collectively, soy protein exerts superior anti-aging effects over casein through coordinated suppression of mTORC1 driven senescence and modulation of gut microbiota-metabolite. This study provides a basis for prioritizing soy protein in healthy aging dietary strategies.",Tian Z; Xu J; Song Y; Ao X; Sun X; Fu Z; Chen Y; Hou W; Sun C,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41606844/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41539802,Molecular weight-engineered lentinan fractions as prebiotic modulators: Steering gut microbiota for precision obesity intervention.,"Lentinus edodes polysaccharides are widely recognized for their potential contributions to human health, in part due to their interactions with the gut microbiota. In this study, three molecular weight (Mw) fractions of water-soluble lentinan (WSL)-WSL-40 (2.19 × 10<sup>6</sup> Da), WSL-60 (2.96 × 10<sup>5</sup> Da), and WSL-80 (1.70 × 10<sup>4</sup> Da), derived from Lentinula edodes cultivated in Zhejiang, were systematically investigated using an in vitro fermentation model to assess their regulatory effects on gut microbiota from healthy and obese individuals. In healthy microbiota, WSL demonstrated diet-induced obesity prevention potential via Mw-dependent regulation: WSL-80 reached a total sugar glycolysis equilibrium the earliest, with maximal butyric acid production, and specifically promoted the growth of Parabacteroides (p < 0.05). In obese microbiota, WSL alleviated dysbiosis and enhanced the proliferation of beneficial genera, with Mw-gradient-dependent effects demonstrated by a progressive reduction in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio as Mw decreased. Higher abundances of Phascolarctobacterium, Klebsiella, and Parabacteroides were observed with WSL-80. Elevated Bacteroides were noted in WSL-60 and WSL-80, and maximal Weissella abundance was observed in WSL-40. This establishes lentinan's Mw gradient as a directional regulator of functional microbiota, thereby providing a theoretical basis for precision nutrition interventions against obesity.",Yan X; Shen Y; Tao Q; Shi P; Zhang Q; Qi Y; Zhou Q; Lu Q; Liang H,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41539802/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41475244,The study of functional properties of kiwifruit peel dietary fiber and the bioactivity as well as synergetic prebiotic effects of bound phenolics in it during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion and colonic fermentation.,"The structure, functional performance of soluble and insoluble Kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis Planch) peel dietary fiber (KPDF) as well as abundant bound phenolics (BPs) in them were systematically investigated. It turned out that KPDF conserved outstanding capacities in adsorption and cation exchange. 23 BPs were identified in KPDF, most of which were inaccessible during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion but up to 27.10 % and 57.89 % BPs were released form insoluble and soluble KPDF after 24 h and 12 h colonic fermentation, respectively. Meanwhile, KPDF promoted the reproduction of beneficial bacteria such as Prevotella, Dialister, Faecalibacterium, while reducing the abundances of harmful bacteria such as Collinsella, Dorea, and Gemmiger with BPs contributing to such features. Such results reflected the promoting effects of BPs in the prebiotic effects of functional KPDF, providing theoretical foundation for the further exploration of KPDF as functional nutritional factors in health promotion.",Hou C; Yu J; Ji M; Chen Y; Liu C; Zhang W; Yu H; Xu C; Zhou X; Sun L; Liu X; Wang Y,Food chemistry,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41475244/,0,0,0,0,0,0

41418521,Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway attenuates the acute toxic effects of copper exposure in Penaeus vannamei.,"Copper (Cu) toxicity in aquaculture poses significant ecological and economic risks. Up to now, the underlying mechanisms by which Cu exposure exerts adverse effects remain unclear. In this study, the relation between Wnt/β-catenin pathway and acute Cu exposure in Penaeus vannamei were investigated from the aspects of Cu bioaccumulation, hepatopancreatic histology, antioxidant capacity, and intestinal microbiota, using P. vannamei exposed by Cu and injected by the Wnt/β-catenin pathway activator (TWS119) or inhibitor (IWR1). The results showed that Cu exposure activated the activities of GSK3β and the expression of gsk3β and axin, while inhibiting the expression of β-catenin, pangolin, and c-myc, indicating suppression of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Cu exposure increased Cu accumulation and bioaccumulation factor (BAF) in the muscle of P. vannamei, and suppression of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway further promoted these increases. Treatment with TWS119 alleviated the Cu-induced suppression of the signaling pathway, reduced ROS accumulation, and mitigated hepatopancreatic damage, whereas IWR1 exacerbated these effects. In addition, Cu exposure significantly altered the diversity and composition of the intestinal microbiota, promoting the proliferation of potential pathogens such as Vibrio, while inhibiting the beneficial taxa (e.g., Tateyamaria, Ralstonia). The activation and inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin pathway alleviate or enhance the effects. Functional prediction via Tax4Fun revealed distinct shifts in microbial metabolic pathways by Cu exposure and the modulation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway. In sum, these findings suggest that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway contributes to the protection of hepatopancreatic health in P. vannamei under Cu exposure by regulating antioxidant system and maintaining intestinal microbiota homeostasis.",Zheng Y; Li G; Derrick A; Xue Z; Luo X; Fu Z; Shi L; Zhang S,The Science of the total environment,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41418521/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41373364,Economic Impact of a Precision Nutrition Digital Therapeutic on Employer Health Costs: A Multi-Employer and Multi-Year Claims Analysis.,"<b>Background:</b> Obesity, gastrointestinal disorders, and mental health conditions are major drivers of employer healthcare expenditures, yet nutrition-focused interventions are infrequently reimbursed by health insurance. Precision nutrition, which integrates genetic, gut microbiome, biometric, and behavioral data to guide personalized dietary and lifestyle changes, may offer a scalable approach to reducing costs associated with diet-responsive conditions. <b>Objectives:</b> To evaluate the impact of a precision nutrition digital therapeutic on employer medical spending for diet-responsive conditions in self-insured U.S. health plans. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a retrospective cohort study of medical claims from January 2022 to December 2024 across seven U.S. self-insured employers. Employees enrolled in a precision nutrition digital therapeutic (n = 258) were compared with never-enrolled peers (n = 8268). We estimated treatment effects using a two-stage difference-in-differences model with member and calendar-month fixed effects and clustered standard errors, focusing on per-member-per-year (PMPY) employer-paid medical spending overall and for predefined diet-responsive condition categories. PMPY estimates were defined conditional on months with positive employer-paid spending and therefore reflect changes in the intensity of spending among members generating claims rather than unconditional per-capita costs. <b>Results:</b> Enrollment in the precision nutrition digital therapeutic was associated with a -$3012 PMPY reduction in diet-responsive medical spending (<i>p</i> = 0.021) relative to non-enrolled peers on this conditional basis. The largest relative reductions were observed for digestive disorders (-$9240 PMPY; <i>p</i> = 0.029) and obesity (-$4884 PMPY; <i>p</i> = 0.007), with a smaller reduction for anxiety-related conditions (-$1356 PMPY; <i>p</i> = 0.043). Total medical spending decreased by -$4044 PMPY but this change did not reach statistical significance (<i>p</i> = 0.09). <b>Conclusions:</b> In this multi-employer claims analysis, participation in a precision nutrition digital therapeutic was associated with lower employer-paid medical expenditures for diet-responsive conditions, particularly digestive disorders and obesity. These findings suggest that precision nutrition digital therapeutics may represent a scalable strategy for employers to address the economic burden of chronic disease within self-insured health plans by reducing the intensity of medical spending among members.",Pedroso I; Saravanan SK; Kumbhare SV; Sharma G; Almonacid DE; Sinha R,"Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41373364/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41365911,Microbiome-dependent functional responses to structurally distinct oligosaccharides revealed by metaproteomics.,"Dietary oligosaccharides are prebiotics that fuel gut microbes, but individual microbiomes may respond differently depending on oligosaccharide structures as well as microbiome composition and function. The extent to which specific gut microbial communities exhibit personalized functional responses to distinct oligosaccharides remains underexplored. We applied a standardized ex vivo microbiome culture, called RapidAIM, coupled with metaproteomics to examine how six structurally diverse oligosaccharides affect the gut microbiota functional response. Our study shows that while human gut microbiomes share some commonalities in utilizing oligosaccharides (e.g. prioritizing dietary fibers over mucin), the fine-scale metabolic and taxonomic responses are highly individualized. Such findings underscore the importance of considering personal microbiome profiles when predicting the outcome of prebiotic interventions. In a broader context, our metaproteomic approach provides a framework for identifying optimal prebiotic choices tailored to individual microbiomes. Ultimately, understanding these personalized responses could inform precision nutrition strategies.",Zhang A; Wu Q; Mayne J; Ning Z; Qin H; Dewar A; Figeys D,NPJ biofilms and microbiomes,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41365911/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41354681,Tissue-resident microbiota impacts colorectal cancer progression and prognosis.,"To deepen the understanding of tissue-resident microbiota in colorectal cancer (CRC), we analyzed whole-genome and transcriptome data from 937 patients. We identified 249 genera and 361 species commonly present in both tumors and adjacent normal tissues (NATs). Distinct microbial signatures were associated with anatomical location, tumor stages, hypermutation status, mutations in CRC driver and DNA damage repair genes, as well as consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs). Notably, the presence of the pks island and elevated abundance of Enterobacteriaceae were linked to poor prognosis specifically in CMS2 tumors. Finally, microbial risk scores derived from taxa present in tumor or NATs predicted patient prognosis independently of established clinico-molecular factors. Prognostic taxa were strongly associated with tumor transcriptomic pathways related to hypoxia, immune response, and metabolic status. These findings revealed the heterogeneity of tissue-resident microbiota and their critical role in CRC progression, highlighting potential avenues for targeted intervention.",Shi Z; Ren H; Lin C; Li F; Wu M; Yang F; Luo T; Nunes L; Isaksson A; Hammarström K; Zhu T; Zhu S; Zhong Y; Ljuslinder I; Uhlén M; Palmqvist R; Glimelius B; Wu K; Sjöblom T; Zhong H,Nature communications,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41354681/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41352811,Low-cholesterol egg yolk lipids alleviated the development of atherosclerosis in ApoE <sup>-/-</sup> mice by regulating bile acid metabolism and gut microbiota.,"Atherosclerosis (AS), a major cardiovascular disease driver, can be caused by high levels of serum cholesterol. Eggs are the main source for dietary cholesterol, and although epidemiological studies reported no association between egg intakes and cardiovascular diseases, dietary cholesterol intake is still restricted for individuals with dyslipidemia. This study evaluated the effects of egg yolk lipids isolated from low-cholesterol (LC) and normal eggs (NC) on the progression of AS using the ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice at doses corresponding to one (L) or two (H) eggs daily in human. After the 8-weeks' intervention with LC, the aortic plaque areas were significantly reduced, along with the alleviation of oxidative stress by elevating aortic SOD activity. Serum contents of TC and LDL-C were significantly decreased in LC-H group, as well as the pro-inflammatory TNF-α, IL-1β and relative expression of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1). Lipidomics revealed that PE contents in LC significantly increased while PC decreased compared with NC, leading to the increases in serum contents of DHA-rich PE. LC intervention inhibited hepatic cholesterol synthesis by upregulating LDLR and CYP7A1, enhanced LDL-C clearance and conversion to bile acids, with a significantly increase in UDCA and TUDCA while decrease in LCA and DCA. These bioactivities of LC were related to the enrichment of Lactobacillus and Akkermansia and decrease of Rikenella and Faecalimonas. Our studies first give direct evidence for evaluating the health effects of eggs, especially eggs with reduced contents of cholesterol, which laid a theoretical foundation for defining the target populations of low-cholesterol eggs.",Cheng L; Zhang M; Wu F; Dong J; Wang Y; Dong L; Ma Y; Zheng C; Wang Z; Li Y; Wang R; Ren F; Fang B,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41352811/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41338497,Gut microbiota and metabolomic: The potential mechanism underlying the female-specific protective effects of Craterellus cornucopioides polysaccharide against chemotherapy-induced intestinal injury.,"Chemotherapy agents, including cyclophosphamide (CTX), frequently induce severe intestinal injury characterized by oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, and microbiota dysbiosis, particularly in females who exhibit heightened immune and metabolic sensitivity. This investigation assessed the protective properties of Craterellus cornucopioides polysaccharide (CCP) against CTX-induced intestinal injury, with a focus on their impact on women's health through modulation of the gut microbiota and metabolic pathways. CCP significantly improved antioxidant and immune biomarkers (sIgA, SOD, CAT, T-AOC) while reducing pro-inflammatory markers (TNF-α, MDA) in mice treated with CTX. Histological analysis showed CCP restored intestinal barrier integrity by boosting the levels of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Claudin-1) and promoting intestinal stem cell repair. Additionally, CCP modulated gut microbiota, increasing beneficial taxa (Lactobacillus, Dubosiella), while decreasing pathogenic genus (Bacteroides), thereby re-establishing microbial balance. Metabolomic analysis indicates that the differential involvement of steroid hormone biosynthesis, bile acid metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism in the observed regulatory effects. This underscored its role in restoring intestinal integrity and overall physiological balance. These findings establish a foundation for the development of female-specific adjunctive therapies to enhance gut health during chemotherapy.",Wang F; Li Y; Feng X; Shu Y; Zhang C; Li L; Guo M,International journal of biological macromolecules,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41338497/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41332831,Mechanistic insights into microbiome-dependent and personalized responses to dietary fibre in a randomized controlled trial.,"Dietary fiber supplementation can reduce cardiometabolic risk, but its effective use is limited by incomplete understanding of fibre-microbiome interactions and highly individualized responses. We tested acacia gum (AG; fermentable fibre), resistant starch type 4 (RS4; fermentable fibre), and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC; non-fermentable control fibre) in a six-week randomized trial in adults with excess body weight. Multi-omics profiling revealed distinct, structure-specific microbiota and short-chain fatty acid shifts with AG and RS4, which were not directly linked to physiological outcomes. Improvements in inflammation, gut barrier function, and satiety occurred across all arms, indicating fermentation-independent effects. AG reduced plasma ghrelin, linked to microbial carbohydrate-active enzyme genes targeting its structures. Machine-learning models predicted individualized, fiber-specific effects on blood pressure (AG) and C-reactive protein (RS4) from microbial pathways and fecal bile acids.

41327482,Butyrate-producing commensal bacteria confers colon immune defense function via enhancing H4K31 Crotonylation of macrophages.,"The mechanisms by which microbiota from disease-resistant populations or animals improve intestinal immune defense remain incompletely elucidated. Tibetan pig, a renowned disease-resistant breed, serve as a valuable research subject for the health of humans and economic animals. In this study, fecal microbiota transplantation from Tibetan piglets into mice conferred enhanced resistance to C. rodentium DBS100. Further microbiota profiling and metabolomics analysis showed this protection may be partly ascribed to C. butyricum SLZX19-05 in recipients' colon. Administration of C. butyricum SLZX19-05 to germ-free mice resulted in the significantly increased lysozyme expression within colonic macrophages, subsequently bolstering the resistance to C. rodentium infection. In mice and piglets, this C. butyricum similarly elevated the lysozyme level in colon and decreased diarrhea incidence. Conversely, lyz1-knockout heightened mice's susceptibility to C. rodentium, highlighting lysozyme's critical role in immune defense. Mechanistically, this study systematically revealed that C. butyricum enhanced lysozyme expression by inhibiting mTORC1-HDAC3/8 pathway, leading to the increased H4K31 Crotonylation (H4K31Cr) and openness of an upstream region of lyz1 promoter via butyrate in macrophages. Additionally, H4K31-mutant mice showed the leukopenia, further validating the significance of H4K31Cr in immune regulation. Collectively, mTORC1-HDAC3/8-H4K31Cr pathway is a key mechanism by which butyrate-producing commensal bacteria enhance immune defense in gut. This discovery provides a novel foundation for the screening and application of the next generation of butyrate-producing probiotics.

41305606,<i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> Lp20 Alleviates High Fat Diet-Induced Obesity in Mice via Its Bile Salt Hydrolase Activity.,"<b>Background:</b> Obesity is a highly prevalent chronic disease characterized by excessive weight gain and fat accumulation. There is growing evidence that <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> strains with bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity are effective in preventing and alleviating obesity. <b>Methods:</b> Initially, we screened bacterial strains with high hydrolytic activity against glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GDCA), and constructed an isogenic bsh1 knockout mutant. Subsequently, male C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) were randomly assigned to receive daily gavage of either the wild-type Lp20 (Lp20-WT) or the bsh1-deficient mutant (Lp20-<i>Δbsh1</i>) for 8 weeks. Serum cholesterol levels and histopathological changes in liver sections were monitored. Hepatic gene expression was quantified by RT-qPCR, and fecal bacterial communities were analyzed via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. These comprehensive assessments aimed to evaluate metabolic improvements and uncover the potential mechanisms behind the observed effects. <b>Results:</b><i>L. plantarum</i> Lp20 hydrolyzed 91.62% of GDCA, exhibiting the highest bile-salt hydrolase (BSH) activity among tested isolates. Whole-genome sequencing and in-silico analyses mapped this activity to <i>bsh1</i>; gene deletion of <i>bsh1</i> confirmed the role of <i>bsh1</i> in GDCA hydrolysis. Daily gavage of the wild-type strain (Lp20-WT) to diet-induced obese mice markedly attenuated weight gain, reduced inguinal white adipose tissue and mesenteric fat mass, and lowered serum TC and LDL-C by 20.8% and 33.3%, respectively, while decreasing ALT and AST levels and reversing hepatic steatosis. In contrast, the bsh1-null mutant (Lp20-<i>Δbsh1</i>) failed to elicit any measurable metabolic benefit. Mechanistically, Lp20-WT upregulated rate-limiting bile-acid synthetic enzymes CYP7A1 and CYP27A1, thereby accelerating the catabolism of cholesterol into bile acids. Concurrently, it activated hepatic TGR5 and FXR signaling axes to modulate hepatic metabolism. Moreover, Lp20-WT restructured the gut microbiota by notably enhancing the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as <i>norank_f__Muribaculaceae</i>, <i>Akkermansia</i>, and <i>Alistipes</i>, while reducing the abundance of potentially harmful taxa, including <i>norank_f__Desulfovibrionaceae</i>, <i>Dubosiella</i>, and <i>Mucispirillum</i>. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study provides direct evidence of BSH's anti-obesity effects through gene deletion. Specifically, BSH lowers cholesterol by modulating hepatic bile-acid metabolism-related gene expression and altering the gut microbiota composition. However, the study is limited by a small sample size (<i>n</i> = 6), the use of male mice only, and its preclinical stage, indicating a need for further validation across diverse strains and human populations.",Bai X; Lu F; Jing Y; Wang H; Qian H; Zhang M; Zhai Z; Hao Y,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41305606/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41289287,Body mass index distinctly modulates the associations between Alistipes and CRP/IL-6 in metabolic and lupus inflammatory features.,"Several investigations have documented relationships between body mass index (BMI) and gut microbiota composition in the context of inflammation. However, the precise interaction between BMI and gut microbiota influencing inflammatory markers is still unclear, presenting a challenge for personalized interventions. This study aimed to analyze anthropometric, biochemical and inflammatory variables of participants with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) compared to those with low-grade metabolic inflammation (MI), as well as to elucidate the impact of gut microbiota composition, particularly Alistipes, in relation to adiposity, as assessed by BMI, on inflammatory markers within the METAINFLAMATION cohort. A total of 127 adults diagnosed with both diseases, categorized according to the WHO definition of obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) and phenotypically analyzed by 16S sequencing of fecal samples. The results showed that patients with low-grade MI had higher anthropometric values, glycosylated hemoglobin and triglyceride levels. On the other hand, patients with SLE and high BMI showed elevated insulin, CRP, and fibrinogen levels, alongside significant changes in Alistipes abundance. Notably, CRP levels were influenced by both BMI and Alistipes, particularly in lupus individuals with higher BMI, and elevated IL-6 was associated with higher CRP in this subgroup. CRP levels are influenced by BMI and Alistipes shahii abundance, especially in lupus individuals with higher BMI. In addition, elevated IL-6 concentrations are significantly associated with more elevated CRP levels in SLE individuals with higher BMI. These findings showed that CRP levels are influenced by BMI and Alistipes, particularly in lupus individuals with higher BMI and highlight the need for personalized approaches based on body composition, inflammatory markers and gut microbiota in patients with lupus and obesity for improving clinical management and outcomes.",Chero-Sandoval L; Higuera-Gómez A; de Cuevillas B; Castejón R; Martínez-Urbistondo M; Mellor-Pita S; Moreno-Torres V; de Luis D; Cuevas-Sierra A; Martínez JA,PloS one,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41289287/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41267246,Exploring the rare and abundant bacterial community structures and their metabolic differences in various types of qula cheese.,"Qula is a fermented cheese-like product made from yak milk. Although the bacterial communities in qula have been well documented, the diversity and functions of both abundant and rare bacterial subcommunities are still unclear. Here, our study examines the community structures of abundant and rare taxa, as well as their metabolite profiles, in the distinct qula samples from Tibet, China, employing high-throughput sequencing and untargeted metabolomics. Our results indicate that rare bacterial taxa account for 98.15 % of total operational taxonomic units and 48 % of total sequences. Dominant bacteria from abundant taxa consist of Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, and Acetobacter, while rare taxa contain Prevotella, Ruminococcus, and Butyrivibrio. Furthermore, we show that stochastic processes predominantly influence bacterial assembly in qula microbial communities. Specifically, stochastic processes have a more significant impact on community assembly for rare taxa, while deterministic processes are more important for abundant taxa. Moreover, we evaluate the contributions of rare taxa to network complexity and community stability, identifying potential keystone species. By analyzing metabolic profiles, we further compared the differences in metabolic functions between rare and abundant taxa in the qula microbiome. Our study shows that, along with abundant taxa, rare taxa in the qula microbiome play a significant role in community assembly and interactions, offering valuable insights into the microbial ecosystems of traditional fermented foods.",Huang X; Li R; Zhang L; Chen X; Gong X; Kang J,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41267246/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41239457,"Modulating effects of microbiota on synbiotic intervention outcomes for microbiota-derived trimethylamine, trimethylamine N-oxide and indoxyl sulfate in healthy young medical students: insights from a 12-week randomized clinical trial.","Microbiota-derived metabolites, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) and indoxyl sulfate (IS), have been implicated in cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic diseases. Synbiotic interventions are a promising strategy to modulate these metabolites, but their efficacy may vary depending on host-microbial characteristics. This study investigated whether a multi-strain synbiotic could reduce serum concentrations of trimethylamine (TMA), TMAO, and IS in healthy young adults, and whether baseline characteristics of the gut microbiota influence individual responses to the intervention. In a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 38 healthy young medical students received either a synbiotic or placebo. Serum levels of TMA, TMAO, and IS were measured at baseline, 6 weeks, and week 12, two hours after consuming two eggs. Gut microbiota composition and function were assessed using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and predicted through metagenomic profiling (PICRUSt2). Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was applied to identify groups of co-occurring bacterial taxa (ASVs) and functional orthologous groups - KEGG Orthologs (KOs). The synbiotic intervention did not produce significant changes in TMA, TMAO, or IS levels across the entire study population. There were no significant changes in alpha diversity or microbiota composition during the intervention. However, baseline microbiota-related factors influenced individual responses to synbiotic therapy. Two taxonomic WGCNA modules, containing Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae, were associated with greater reductions in IS levels in participants receiving synbiotics. Also, a module containing Lachnospirales and Oscillospirales showed a potential modulatory effect on TMA levels. A KO module enriched in genes involved in bacterial secretion systems, sulfur metabolism, and methanogenesis pathways - including K14083 (mttB) and K14084 (mttC), both implicated in the conversion of TMA to methane - was significantly associated with reductions in TMA. In this randomized, placebo-controlled trial in healthy young adults, the synbiotic did not produce a significant arm-wide effect on post-challenge serum TMA, TMAO, or indoxyl sulfate over 12 weeks. Exploratory moderation analyses suggest that baseline gut-microbiota features, taxonomic and functional, may modulate individual responses, particularly for IS and TMA, supporting a precision-nutrition framework. The translational significance of this study stems from the observation that primary prevention, which is particularly important in metabolic diseases, should be individualised based on the function of the microbiota.",Kaczmarczyk M; Kędzierska-Kapuza K; Skonieczna-Żydecka K; Surówka A; Drożdżal S; Lechowicz K; Buszman M; Szkudlarek U; Cembrowska-Lech D; Podsiadło K; Samborowska E; Łoniewski I; Ciechanowski K,Journal of translational medicine,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41239457/,0,0,0,0,1,0
41237511,Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway alleviates the toxic effects of cadmium acute exposure on Penaeus vannamei.,"Penaeus vannamei has been studied as a bioindicator for monitoring heavy metal pollution. Heavy metals exposure can lead to disease by disrupting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Cadmium (Cd), a common contaminant in aquatic environments, has been investigated for its toxic effects on P. vannamei. To date, the underlying mechanisms by which Cd exposure exerts adverse effects remain unclear. In this study, the relation between Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and Cd acute exposure in P. vannamei were investigated from the aspects of Cd bioaccumulation, hepatopancreatic histology, antioxidant capacity, and intestinal microbiota, using P. vannamei exposed by Cd and injected by the Wnt/β-catenin pathway activator (TWS119) and inhibitor (IWR1). The results showed that Cd exposure heightened GSK3β activity and transcription of gsk3β and axin, while simultaneously dampening β-catenin, pangolin, and c-myc expression, collectively revealing marked attenuation of the Wnt/β-catenin signalling cascade. Consequently, Cd accumulated in shrimp muscle and the bioaccumulation factor rose after Cd exposure, which accumulated was further amplified when the Wnt/β-catenin pathway remained suppressed. TWS119 restoration reversed Cd-imposed signalling repression, curtailed reactive oxygen species, and alleviated hepatopancreatic injury, whereas IWR1 intensified these detrimental outcomes. Furthermore, Cd exposure significantly decreased the intestinal microbiota α-diversity (Sobs, Shannon, Simpson, pielou, and pd) of P. vannamei, while the simpson, pielou, and pd indices were elevated of P. vannamei by injecting TWS119. Otherwise, Cd exposure disturbing the endocrine system, while the modulating of Wnt/β-catenin pathway was associated with endocrine and metabolic disorders.

41188726,A lightweight single-view contrastive learning hypergraph neural network for food-microbe-disease association prediction.,"Identifying potential associations among food, gut microbiota and disease is fundamental for elucidating interaction mechanisms and advancing personalized healthy dietary strategies. While computational methods have been extensively applied to predict microbiota-disease associations, methods on predicting food-microbiota relationships remain limited, particularly regarding higher-order food-microbiota-disease interactions. In this work, we construct a food-microbe-disease (FMD) database encompassing 190 food items, 219 gut microbiota species, and 163 disease entities, resulting in 17,065 FMD associations. We then propose a lightweight single-view contrastive learning hypergraph neural network (LSCHNN) for FMD association prediction on the sparse FMD dataset. LSCHNN formulates ternary FMD interactions as a hypergraph, in which foods, microbes, and diseases are represented by nodes and FMD triplets are represented by hyperedges, and leverages the biological features of foods, microbes, and diseases as node attributes. Subsequently, a hypergraph neural network is designed to learn the embeddings of foods, microbes, and diseases from the hypergraph and predict potential ternary FMD associations. Additionally, we incorporate a single-view contrastive learning mechanism that enhances the model's ability to extract discriminative features and improves generalization on sparse data. Comprehensive comparison experiments demonstrate that LSCHNN outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of the precision of predicting ternary FMD associations and discovering more potential FMD associations. Case studies on two microbes further confirm the effectiveness of LSCHNN in identifying potential FMD associations. A novel computational model, LSCHNN, is proposed, marking the first integration of hypergraph neural networks with lightweight single-view contrastive learning for ternary FMD association prediction, providing a groundbreaking framework for precision nutrition and personalized dietary interventions.",Hu J; Hu M; Wu Y; Mu S; Huang D; Wang B; Gao Y; Gu S; Zhu J,BMC bioinformatics,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41188726/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41183487,Lactobacillus gasseri TF08-1 ameliorates high-fat diet induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and regulates gut microbiota in mice.,"This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of Lactobacillus gasseri TF08-1, a gut bacterium isolated from healthy adolescents, in alleviating high-fat diet (HFD)-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This followed our discovery of lipid metabolism-related genes in its complete genome. The high-precision complete genome map of L. gasseri TF08-1 was constructed for the first time, revealing enriched lipid metabolism pathways, including bile salt hydrolase activity and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. After supplementing L. gasseri TF08-1 for 8 weeks in mice fed with a high-fat diet, the serum triglyceride (TG) level decreased by 41.95%, the hepatic total cholesterol (TC) level decreased by 35.09%, and the TNF-α level decreased by 42.91%. Meanwhile, the NAS score decreased by 3.66 points. The treatment significantly reduced hepatic lipid accumulation, lowered proinflammatory cytokines, and improved steatosis scores. Metagenomic analyses showed L. gasseri TF08-1 restored gut microbiota balance, significantly increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Phocaeicola vulgatus, while also enriching fatty acid degradation pathways. Lactobacillu gasseri TF08-1 demonstrates probiotic efficacy against NAFLD through dual mechanisms: direct metabolic modulation and gut microbiota restoration. The lipid metabolism capacity encoded by its genome likely contributes to therapeutic effects.",Xu Q; He N; Tian Y; Wu Z; Wang H; Liu B; Yang Z; Zhang H; Luo Q; Zhong Y; Xiao L; Li S; Zou Y,Journal of applied microbiology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41183487/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41178129,SCFAs-Enriching Kiwifruit-Derived Synbiotic Reprograms Microbiota to Suppress XOD and Promote Urate Clearance.,"Gut dysbiosis contributes to hyperuricemia (HUA), yet plant-based synbiotics that boost short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are underexplored. We developed a kiwifruit-derived synbiotic combining <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> LP220 with kiwifruit powder and evaluated its effects in <i>vitro</i> and in an adenine and potassium oxonate mouse HUA model (8 weeks). In <i>vitro</i>, LP220 produced propionate 2.528 ± 0.369 μg/10<sup>9</sup> CFU/mL and butyrate 36.06 ± 2.353 μg/10<sup>9</sup> CFU/mL. In <i>vivo</i>, the synbiotic lowered serum uric acid by 62.27% versus untreated HUA (<i>P</i> < 0.01) and outperformed LP220 or kiwifruit alone, increasing fecal/serum and urinary/serum uric acid ratios by 242.99 and 117.49% (<i>P</i> < 0.01). Fecal and serum propionate and butyrate rose 38.01-129.34% (<i>P</i> < 0.01), accompanied by reduced systemic inflammation (serum LPS - 38.81%; IL-1β - 23.74%). Mechanistically, the synbiotic decreased hepatic xanthine oxidase activity and upregulated ABCG2 expression in colon and kidney, with recovery of gut diversity and enrichment of SCFAs-producers. These results indicate the kiwifruit synbiotic suppresses urate synthesis and promotes excretion via SCFA-mediated microbiota-host interactions, suggesting a microbiota-targeted nutritional strategy for HUA.",Wang Q; Pu X; Song Y; Lv Z; Hao J; Yuan T; Wang Y; Liu X; Guo R; Liu Z,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41178129/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41174377,Microwave treatment modulates in vitro dynamic gastrointestinal migration of sorghum polyphenols and influences gut microbiota metabolism.,"Gastrointestinal digestion is indispensable for the utilization of polyphenols from the diet. Polyphenol migration in the gastrointestinal tract, potential antioxidant activity, colonic accumulation, and regulation of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by polyphenols were systematically explored in steamed sorghum (NorS) and microwaved steamed-sorghum (Mic-S). Relatively rapid gastric emptying and fragmented chyme of Mic-S liberated higher polyphenols (8.06 mg GAE/g DW) and antioxidant activity in the intestinal supernatant. Compared with the stomach, the bioaccessibility of intestinal polyphenols was significantly higher. Flavones, isoflavones, and flavanones were enriched in intestinal supernatant of Mic-S, while chyme was richer in phenolic acids and flavone glycosides (o-glucoside and c-glucoside). Moreover, fecal fermentation revealed higher bioaccessibility in Mic-S, which was attributed to the lower-size chyme that facilitated the extensive metabolism of Bifidobacterium, Megamonas, and Segatella. The hydroxybenzoic, hydroxycinnamic, and monomeric flavones enriched in the colon were correlated with Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides. Additionally, these low-molecular polyphenols indirectly regulated the production of SCFAs through amino acid metabolism and glucose metabolism pathways. The above findings suggested the enhancing effect of microwave treatment on the gastrointestinal accessibility of food-derived polyphenols, and provided theoretical support for the development of grain foods related to precision nutrition and intestinal health.",Xu L; Dai L; Yao D; Hu Y; Zhao W; Song X; Li Z,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41174377/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41137385,Gut Microbiota-Modulating Diets Attenuate Cardiovascular-Kidney-Metabolic Syndrome via Inflammatory Mediation: Insights From NHANES and Machine Learning Model.,"The role of gut microbiota-modulating diets in cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome progression is poorly understood. This study investigated associations between the dietary index for gut microbiota (DI-GM) and advanced CKM risk, with a focus on inflammatory mediation. Cross-sectional data from 12,068 NHANES participants (2007-2020) were analyzed. Advanced CKM stages (3-4) were classified using American Heart Association (AHA) criteria. DI-GM scores were derived from 14 dietary components, and inflammatory biomarkers (e.g., dietary inflammatory index [DII], neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio [NLR], systemic inflammation response index [SIRI]) were assessed. Multivariable logistic regression, mediation analysis, and machine learning (XGBoost, SHAP) evaluated associations and predictive performance. High DI-GM adherence (≥6) was associated with a 25% reduction in advanced CKM risk, while each unit increase was associated with a 7% lower risk. Inflammatory biomarkers mediated 42.88% (DII) to 5.59% (neutrophils) of this association. XGBoost identified coffee, refined grains, and fat as top risk predictors. This cross-sectional study underscores the protective role of DI-GM against CKM progression, mediated substantially by inflammation suppression. While these results highlight promising associations, the cross-sectional design necessitates caution in inferring causality. Machine learning underscores the importance of dietary synergy over isolated components, advocating for integrated dietary-microbiota interventions in precision CKM management. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: What is currently known about this topic? Cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome, formally defined in 2023, affects over 25% of US adults, yet evidence linking gut microbiota-targeted dietary patterns to advanced CKM risk remains limited. What is the key research question? Higher dietary index for gut microbiota (DI-GM) scores-characterized by fiber-rich, fermented, and plant-based components-are inversely associated with advanced CKM risk, particularly in males sedentary and hypertension subgroups. How might this study influence clinical practice? Inflammatory biomarkers mediate 42.88% of the association between DI-GM and CKM progression, with machine learning identifying coffee, refined grains, and dietary fat as key contributors to risk stratification, supporting microbiota-driven precision nutrition strategies.",Yan Z; Xu Y; Du X,Journal of food science,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41137385/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41135167,"Precise nutritional diagnosis in digestive system malignancies based on blood nutrients, inflammatory makers, intestinal function indicators and body composition.","Malnutrition is one of the major factors leading to adverse clinical outcomes in cancer. The persistence of malnutrition, inflammatory responses, and intestinal dysfunction form a vicious cycle throughout the disease course in cancer patients. Consequently, simple nutritional therapy alone often has limited clinical efficacy. This study aims to explore precision nutrition diagnosis in patients by examining plasma nutrients, inflammatory markers and intestinal function indicators combined with body composition. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 140 patients with digestive system malignancies, including 87 patients with severe malnutrition (study group: patient-generated subjective global assessment (PG-SGA) ≥ 9) and 53 patients with good nutritional status (control group: PG-SGA ≤3). Plasma untargeted metabolomics were analyzed using Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry. Simultaneously, inflammatory markers and intestinal mucosal barrier function markers were detected. Whole genome sequencing was utilized to examine gut microbiota in fecal samples. A total of 129 differential plasma nutrients were discerned. Clinically concerned metabolites included essential amino acids, essential fatty acids, ketone bodies, nucleotides, vitamins and their metabolites, as well as microbiota metabolites were further analyzed. Among them, severely malnourished patients exhibited significant reductions in l-tryptophan, uridine, vitamin A, and pyrocatechol sulfate compared to the control group. Conversely, levels of lysine, l-phenylalanine, N-lactoyl methionine, arachidonic acid, docosapentaenoic acid, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, and 4-pyridoxic acid were elevated. Compared to the control group, the study group showed significantly higher levels of all inflammatory markers (p < 0.01). Additionally, d-lactate levels were notably increased in the study group (p < 0.001). Microbiota analysis demonstrated significant abnormalities in the gut microbiota at both the phylum and genus levels (LAD>2.5) between the two groups. Furthermore, body mass index (BMI) was remarkable lower in severely malnourished patient (p < 0.05). Based on these differential indicators, six key markers (l-tryptophan, uridine, vitamin A, catechol sulfate, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and BMI) were ultimately selected to establish a precision nutrition diagnostic model, achieving an AUC value of 0.979 (95 % CI: 0.961-0.998) with a Youden index of 0.866, indicating high diagnostic accuracy. The study demonstrate significant abnormalities in blood nutrient levels, inflammatory factor, and intestinal function indicator among patients with severe malnutrition.

41047001,Phenome-wide associations of coffee intake in the human phenotype project.,"Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages globally and has been linked to favorable health outcomes. However, its system-wide relationships with human biology and the underlying mechanisms remain poorly characterized. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between coffee consumption and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) metrics and other biological systems in healthy adults. In the Human Phenotype Project, 8666 generally healthy Israeli adults provided two weeks of real-time dietary logs, from which coffee intake was estimated. Participants wore CGM devices throughout this period, and multimodal data spanning 11 additional systems (e.g., gut microbiome, serum lipidomics, and body composition) were collected. We employed machine learning approaches to quantify the extent to which each system reflected coffee intake. We performed linear regression to identify individual traits associated with coffee intake, with false discovery rates < 0.05 considered significant. This cross-sectional study identified continuously-monitored glucose regulation and gut microbial composition as the most reflective systems of coffee intake, with further analyses revealing favorable glycemic profiles spanning diverse aspects of glucose regulation with increasing coffee intake, and Clostridium phoceensis (i.e., Lawsonibacter asaccharolyticus) as the most significant species positively associated with coffee intake. Additionally, coffee intake was favorably associated with traits across body composition, serum lipidomics, and hepatic, hematopoietic, and renal systems. This study found that habitual coffee intake was linked to multifaceted favorable glucose control captured by CGM and favorable profiles across multiple biological systems, providing mechanistic insights that may guide precision nutrition strategies for diabetes prevention.",Dai J; Dai W; Heianza Y; Qi L,Metabolism: clinical and experimental,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41047001/,0,0,0,0,0,0

41025824,A comprehensive reference catalog of human skin DNA virome reveals novel viral diversity and microenvironmental influences.,"Human skin serves as a dynamic habitat for a diverse microbiome, including a complex array of viruses whose diversity and roles are not fully understood. A total of 2,760 skin metagenomes from 6 published skin studies were collected. A skin virome catalog was constructed using standard methods in the viromics field. Viral characteristics were identified through cross-cohort meta-analysis and used to characterize viral features across different skin environments. We identified 20,927 viral sequences, which clustered into 2,873 viral operational taxonomic units (vOTUs), uncovering a substantial breadth of viral diversity on human skin. The results also highlight significant differences in viral communities that are associated with varying skin microenvironments. The oily skin is enriched in <i>Papillomaviridae</i>, the dry skin area is enriched in <i>Autographiviridae</i> and <i>Inoviridae</i>, and the moist skin is enriched in <i>Herelleviridae</i>. We also investigated the relationship between bacteriophages and bacteria on the skin surface. We found that skin bacteria such as <i>Pseudomonas</i>, <i>Klebsiella</i>, and <i>Staphylococcus</i> are predicted to be infected by phages from the class <i>Caudoviricetes</i>. This comprehensive skin DNA viral catalog significantly advances our understanding of the virome's role within the skin ecosystem. This study presents a comprehensive reference catalog of the human skin DNA virome, constructed from 2,760 metagenomic datasets collected globally. It identified 20,927 viral sequences, with 90.85% representing previously unknown viruses, greatly expanding our understanding of skin viral diversity. The findings reveal significant differences in viral communities between distinct skin microenvironments (oily, dry, and moist) and highlight close interactions between bacteriophages and their bacterial hosts, suggesting a potential role for the virome in maintaining microbial balance and skin health.

Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol compound from grapes, berries and peanuts, is known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This study investigated the effects of resveratrol in a murine model of <i>Citrobacter rodentium</i>-induced colitis. Resveratrol ameliorated disease symptoms, body weight loss, colon shortening, and increased intestinal permeability. Histological and immunofluorescence analyses revealed that resveratrol improved intestinal barrier integrity by increasing goblet cells, upregulating MUC-2 expression, reducing crypt hyperplasia, and suppressing epithelial cell apoptosis. Resveratrol significantly decreased the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Interleukin-22 (IL-22), while restoring the percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup> cells to normal levels. It also attenuated oxidative stress by enhancing the activities of key antioxidant enzymes, including catalase (CAT), total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). Furthermore, resveratrol reshaped the gut microbiota by increasing the abundance of obligate anaerobes <i>Clostridium</i> and decreasing the abundance of facultative anaerobes Enterobacteriaceae. The abundance of <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Dubosiella</i> was also significantly increased by resveratrol. In summary, these findings demonstrate that resveratrol supplementation may serve as a promising nutritional strategy to ameliorate <i>C. rodentium</i> colitis by inhibiting CD4<sup>+</sup> cell activation and remodeling the gut microbiota.",Li J; Feng X; Jing Y; Qian H; Ji Y; Hao Y; Zhai Z,Food & function,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41017361/,0,0,0,0,0,0

The molecular mechanisms by which vitamin D influences the intestinal function in aging remain poorly understood. To address this, a 16 week dietary intervention using a vitamin D<sub>3</sub>-withdraw diet (VDD) combined with d-galactose treatment was conducted in mice. We assessed the gut barrier integrity, immune response, and changes in microbiota composition. In the context of d-galactose-induced aging, VDD significantly reduced serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> levels and exacerbated intestinal permeability and downregulation of ZO-1 and Occludin. VDD led to transcriptional suppression of antiviral defense and antigen presentation pathways in the colon, which correlated with decreased expression of the vitamin D receptor. Additionally, VDD caused detrimental shifts in the gut microbiota, characterized by a decline in beneficial genera including <i>Lactobacillus</i> and an increase in pathogenic genera including <i>Allobaculum</i>. These findings highlight the essential role of vitamin D in maintaining intestinal barrier function, antiviral immunity, and microbiota homeostasis during aging.",Feng X; Li J; Meng Y; Jing Y; Qian H; Zhang W; Liu R; Wang D; Zhang W; Hao Y; Gan D; Shi W,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40966548/,0,0,0,0,0,0

The chemical complexity and anti-colitis activities of these polyphenols remain uncharacterized. This study aimed to systematically elucidate the composition, anti-colitis efficacy, and mechanisms of action of walnut septum polyphenols (WSP). WSP was extracted and purified from the walnut septum, and its components were systematically characterized. The therapeutic efficacy of WSP against ulcerative colitis was evaluated in a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced mouse model, with assessments including body weight, disease activity index (DAI) scores, colon length, serum inflammatory markers, immunohistochemical analysis, Alcian blue staining, and 16S rRNA sequencing for microbiota analysis. Integrated network pharmacology and molecular docking revealed novel core targets, and western blot analysis validated the mechanistic pathways involved in UC amelioration. We identified 259 phenolic compounds in WSP, with 34 recognized as bioactive candidates. WSP restored intestinal barrier integrity and suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines in DSS-treated mice. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed WSP's ability to rebalance gut microbiota by enriching Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Lactobacillus and suppressing the abundance of Escherichia-Shigella and Enterococcus, which correlated with enhanced quorum sensing and amino acid metabolism. Western blotting further confirmed WSP-mediated suppression of the PI3K-AKT pathway. WSP was found to exert anti-colitis effects by regulating the structure and function of intestinal microbiota and alleviating inflammatory damage by inhibiting the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. These findings indicated that walnut septum, as a low-cost by-product, can potentially be used as a functional food ingredient.",Hong Z; Chen J; Shi C; Bai Y; Hu X; Pan Y; Dai J; Sheng J; Xie J; Tian Y,Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40916236/,0,0,0,0,0,0

The current study was designed to test the effects of methanotroph (<i>Methylococcus capsulatus</i>) bacteria meal (MBM) on hybrid grouper growth and intestinal health outcomes. Five iso-nitrogenous and iso-lipidic diets were formulated, comprising a control diet (MBM0) with 400 g/kg fish meal (FM) as the main protein source, and four experimental diets, in which FM was replaced at 5% (MBM2), 10% (MBM4), 20% (MBM8) and 30% (MBM12) with 20, 40, 80 and 120 g/kg of MBM, respectively. The 450 healthy juvenile hybrid grouper (initial weight 28.84 ± 0.05 g) were randomly allocated into five groups, with three replicates in each group and 30 fish in each replicate. They were fed for eight weeks prior to being sampled for transcriptome and microbiome research. The final body weight (FBW, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and weight gain rate (WGR, <i>P</i> < 0.001) were obviously enhanced in MBM2 and MBM8 groups compared to MBM0 group, and the specific growth rate (SGR) in the MBM2 and MBM8 groups were significantly enhanced compared to MBM0 group (<i>P</i> < 0.001). The condition factor (CF) in MBM4 and MBM8 groups were considerably reduced than that in MBM0 group (<i>P</i> = 0.008).

A total of 336 Hy-line brown layer hens aged 55 weeks were randomly assigned to three groups using a completely randomized design: control group (Con, basal diet), ADY group (1 g ADY/kg diet), and ADY-BS combination group ([1 g ADY + 0.1 g BS]/kg diet). Compared with the Con group, ADY-BS group significantly improved egg production (<i>P =</i> 0.024) and reduced feed conversion ratio (<i>P =</i> 0.034), while also significantly increasing feed intake compared to the ADY group (<i>P =</i> 0.020). Additionally, both ADY and ADY-BS significantly enhanced eggshell-breaking strength compared to untreated hens (<i>P <</i> 0.001), with ADY-BS further notably increasing lysozyme levels (<i>P =</i> 0.031), antibody titers against avian influenza H5 and H9 subtypes (<i>P</i> = 0.008 and <i>P</i> = 0.001, respectively), and calcium content in serum (<i>P =</i> 0.021). Analysis of the ileal microbiota revealed significant modifications, as evidenced by reduced richness (Chao1 index: <i>P</i> = 0.016 and <i>P</i> = 0.008 for the ADY and ADY-BS groups, respectively) and improved evenness (Simpson index: <i>P</i> = 0.032 for both groups).

40892695,Integrative Genomics and Phenotypic Profiling Reveal Lacticplantibacillus plantarum BGI-N6 as a Multifunctional Candidate for Dermatological Probiotic Development.,"Probiotics and postbiotics are recognized for their potential to benefit skin health, and complete genome analysis serves as a pivotal tool to accelerate the exploration of probiotic functionalities. To investigate this relationship, this study aimed to elucidate the skin-promoting potential of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum BGI-N6 (BGI-N6) through integrated genomic analysis and phenotypic analysis. Results indicated that the high-precision complete genome of BGI-N6 comprises 3 257 641 bases with a 45% GC content and 3030 CDSs, involving multiple genes related to carbon source fermentation, gastrointestinal tolerance, and environmental adaptability. Notably, BGI-N6 possessed several bacteriostatic, antioxidant, and enzyme activity inhibition-related genes, which could encode the biosynthetic pathways of bacteriocins, glutathione/thioredoxin antioxidant systems, NADH peroxidase, catalase, and various organic acids. Supporting these genomic insights, in vitro experiments comparative evaluation revealed that BGI-N6 exhibited superior capabilities relative to Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 299v (299v) in antioxidant activity, inhibition of cutaneous pathogens growth, and suppression of skin-damaging enzyme (e.g., collagenase and elastase) activity. These effects were correlated with the production of lactic acid, 6-hydroxyhexanoate, coumarins, and other bioactive compounds by BGI-N6. The evidence from integrated genomic analysis and in vitro experiments established a critical theoretical foundation for the development of BGI-N6 as a candidate for probiotic and postbiotic applications targeting skin health.",Wang J; Xu X; Wen Y; Wei B; Chen J; Cai S; Wang M; Wu Z; Liu Y; Zhang H; Zhong Y; Zou Y,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40892695/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40890565,Ketogenic Diet Modulates Gut Microbiota-Brain Metabolite Axis in a Sex- and Genotype-Specific Manner in APOE4 Mice.,"The apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), associated with early brain metabolic dysfunction and gut microbiome alterations. Targeting these early changes through dietary interventions may reduce AD risk in asymptomatic carriers. This study evaluated whether a ketogenic diet (KD) could reshape the gut microbiome and enhance key brain metabolite levels in young APOE4 mice, using APOE3 mice as a neutral-risk comparison. Male and female APOE3 and APOE4 mice were fed either a control diet or KD for 16 weeks, starting at 12 weeks of age. We used shotgun metagenomics and targeted brain metabolomics to identify microbe-metabolite signatures linked to neuroprotection. KD increased beneficial species such as Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lactobacillus reuteri while reducing pathogenic Bacteroides intestinalis. These microbial shifts correlated with improved brain metabolites related to mitochondrial function, neurotransmitter balance, redox homeostasis, and lipid metabolism. Notably, Lactobacillus species and B. intestinalis exhibited inverse correlations with key brain metabolite levels, suggesting their roles as both modulators and biomarkers of brain health. APOE4 females showed the greatest benefits, including restored microbiome diversity and normalization of brain metabolite levels. In contrast, APOE3 mice showed microbiome changes but limited brain metabolic responses. These findings highlight KD's potential to reprogram the gut-brain axis in a genotype- and sex-dependent manner, supporting its use as a precision nutrition strategy to reduce AD risk, particularly in asymptomatic female APOE4 carriers.",Ivanich K; Yackzan A; Flemister A; Chang YH; Xing X; Chen A; Yanckello LM; Sun M; Aware C; Govindarajan M; Kramer S; Ericsson A; Lin AL,Journal of neurochemistry,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40890565/,0,0,0,0,0,0

40840291,"Selenium-enriched Lactobacillus coryniformis H8 alleviates LPS-induced jejunal injury in chicks by modulating antioxidant activity, inflammation, selenoprotein genes, and gut microbiota.","Intestinal inflammation in chicks remains a prevalent health concern, highlighting the importance of developing effective alternatives to conventional antibiotics. This study aimed to investigate the effect of selenium-enriched Lactobacillus coryniformis H8 (Se-H8) in alleviating lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced intestinal inflammation in chicks and the related mechanisms. 252 1-day-old White Leghorn chicks (n = 6 cages/treatment, 6 chicks/cage) were randomly divided into seven groups (Control, LPS, H8, Se-H8, H8-Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub>, and ENR). After 14 days of continuous gavage, a 3-day LPS intraperitoneal stress injection was performed. Serum, jejunum, and cecal faeces were collected for analysis of selenium levels, inflammatory factors, antioxidant status, gene expression, and microbial composition. Compared to the other treatment groups, Se-H8 exhibited the most pronounced alleviation of LPS-induced intestinal damage. This superior efficacy was reflected in significantly improved jejunal morphology, elevated serum selenium levels (P < 0.05), enhanced antioxidant capacity (increased GPX and SOD activities, decreased MDA levels; P < 0.05), and modulated inflammatory responses (reduced IL-1β and TNF-α, increased IL-10; P < 0.05). Furthermore, Se-H8 altered the expression of 23 selenoprotein genes in the jejunum and suppressed mRNA expression of key genes (TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-10) in the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway compared to the LPS group. Additionally, cecal microbiological analyses showed that Se-H8 increased the abundance of seven beneficial microorganisms, including Eubacterium_oxidoreducens_group, Eisenbergiella, Enorma, Catenibacillus, Merdibacter, Lachnospiraceae_FCS020_group, and GCA-900066575. In conclusion, Se-H8 alleviates LPS-induced jejunal injury by regulating antioxidant status, inflammation levels, selenoprotein genes expression, and gut microbial homeostasis. These findings highlight the potential of selenium-enriched microorganisms like Se-H8 as viable antibiotic alternatives for managing enteritis in poultry.",Xu ZJ; Xiao D; Chen K; Han JH; Zhu KD; Liu CM; Wang LS; Yu ZQ; Huang JQ,Poultry science,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40840291/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40838083,ACE trial design: Equol targeting estrogen receptor-β in vascular and cognitive aging.,"Equol, a gut microbiome-derived metabolite of soy isoflavone daidzein, functions as a selective estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) agonist. In preclinical studies, it has demonstrated vascular protective and antioxidant effects, with emerging evidence suggesting potential neuroprotective properties. However, its role in preventing vascular aging and cognitive decline in humans remains unexplored. The Arterial Stiffness, Cognition, and Equol (ACE) trial investigates whether daily equol supplementation can slow the progression of arterial stiffness, brain white matter lesions, and cognitive decline in older adults without dementia. ACE is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted at the University of Pittsburgh, Wake Forest University, and Emory University. Community-dwelling adults aged 65 to 85 years without dementia were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to receive either 10 mg/day of equol or placebo for 24 months. The primary outcome is arterial stiffness assessed by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. Secondary outcomes include white matter lesions detected on the brain magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive function as assessed by the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite. Power calculations were based on a planned sample size of 400 participants, accounting for an anticipated 20% attrition rate. A total of 1783 individuals were pre-screened, and 764 underwent in-person eligibility assessment. Of these, 369 participants were randomized into two groups: Arm A (<i>n</i> = 185) and Arm B (<i>n</i> = 184). The randomized sample self-reported as 52% women and 22% Black/African American participants. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were well balanced between the two arms, indicating successful randomization. ACE successfully enrolled a racially diverse population of older adults and achieved near-target recruitment. ACE is the first large-scale trial to evaluate whether equol, a selective ERβ agonist, can impact vascular and cognitive aging, paving the way for precision nutrition strategies in dementia prevention. We detail the first randomized controlled trial of equol, an estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) agonist, for vascular and cognitive aging.The study tested equol's effects on arterial stiffness, white matter lesions, and cognition.The multisite trial enrolled 369 self-reported White and Black older adults aged 65 to 85 years.The trial investigated a novel dietary metabolite targeting ERβ pathways.",Sekikawa A; Wharton W; Murray-Krezan C; Wu M; Chang Y; Snitz BE; Coccari M; Yang S; Love ML; Cusick D; Wang R; Li M; Park C; Li J; DeConne TM; Smith C; Verble DD; Lancet MQ; Foroud T; Kim T; Nadkarni NK; Mettenburg JM; Zamora E; Lopez OL; Hughes TM,"Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N.

40832781,Ameliorating Effect of Bifidobacterium breve CM02-09T on High-Fat Diet-Induced Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Mice.,"Evidences have demonstrated that the regulation of gut microbiota by probiotics can be utilized to prevent nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); Bifidobacterium was widely used as a potential therapeutic alternative for metabolic diseases. In this study, the probiotic functions of Bifidobacterium breve CM02-09T and its effects on NAFLD were investigated through genome annotation and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mouse model. The genome of B. breve CM02-09T consists of a single circular chromosome of 2 372 890 bp. Eighteen male C57BL/6J mice were fed a normal chow diet (NCD), a high-fat diet, and a high-fat diet (HFD) with B. breve CM02-09T separately for 12 weeks. Histopathology, lipid content, biochemical markers in the liver and blood, and metagenomics were assessed and compared. Our results indicate that supplementation with B. breve CM02-09T alleviated liver damage, reduced fat accumulation in the liver and epididymal adipose tissue, decreased TNF-α concentration, and improved NAFLD activity scores. Metagenomic analysis revealed that administration of B. breve CM02-09T promoted a decreased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio (F/B), an increase in beneficial bacteria, and enhanced lipid metabolism functions. Correlation analysis between the differential species and NAFLD-related indicators suggested that the anti-NAFLD effect of B. breve CM02-09T is related to the gut microbiota. Therefore, B. breve CM02-09T attenuates NAFLD by modulating the gut microbiota and could be used as an alternative therapeutic strategy.",Tian Y; Xu Q; Wu Z; Wang H; Hu X; He N; Li H; Liu B; Zhong Y; Zhang H; Wang M; Xiao L; Li S; Zou Y,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40832781/,0,0,0,0,0,0

40785783,Effectiveness of personalized granola tailored to the gut microbiota for improving gut environment and mood states.,"The gut microbiota plays a critical role in host metabolism, immunity, and mental health. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), produced through the gut microbial fermentation of dietary fibers, are essential metabolites influencing host physiology. Previous studies have suggested that dietary interventions impact SCFA production, but individual responses vary owing to gut microbiota composition. This study sought to investigate whether personalized granola, formulated based on an individual's gut microbiota, enhances SCFA production and improves metabolic and mental health outcomes. A single-arm, single-blind, before-and-after study was conducted on 99 participants. Personalized granola (BodyGranola<sup>®</sup>, Calbee, Inc.) was tailored to the gut microbiota composition of each individual by incorporating three prebiotic ingredients selected from six options. Participants consumed 50 g of granola daily for 8 weeks. Fecal samples were collected at baseline, week 4, and week 8 for gut microbiota and intestinal metabolite analysis via 16S rRNA gene sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Mood and defecation were assessed using the Profile of Mood States Second Edition (POMS2), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), and defecation questionnaires. Personalized granola consumption tended to increase SCFAs, including acetic acid and caproic acid. The relative abundance of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> also increased. POMS2 assessments indicated improvements in vitality and total mood disturbance scores. Stool volume increased, but bloating and gas accumulation worsened. Microbiota-type-specific variations in metabolite production were observed. Personalized granola enhances SCFA production and improves mood, suggesting that dietary interventions tailored to gut microbiota composition may optimize health outcomes. Future studies should explore gut microbiota-based precision nutrition in larger, controlled trials.",Sasaki H; Masutomi H; Yamauchi Y; Ishihara K; Fukuda S,Frontiers in microbiology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40785783/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40746318,Characteristic alterations of gut microbiota and metabolites in patients with perianal abscess: a multi-omics analysis.,"Various studies have highlighted the important associations between perianal abscess (PA) and gut microbiota and related metabolites. Nevertheless, the establishment of causal relationships between these associations remains to be determined. This study aimed to provide direct evidence and a comprehensive understanding of gut microbiota disturbance in children with PA through combined 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomic analysis. Thirty three children with PA and 16 healthy controls (HC) were continuously enrolled, and the demographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects were collected. First, 16S rRNA sequencing was used to evaluate differences in the gut microbiota between children with PA and the HC group, and 10 children with PA and 10 children in the HC group were randomly selected for non-targeted metabolomic analysis. There were significant differences in the gut microbiota diversity and composition between children with PA and HC. Comprehensive analyses revealed an elevation of the genus <i>Enterococcus</i> and a depletion of the phylum <i>Firmicutes</i> as well as <i>Eubacterium_hallii_group</i>, <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Blautia</i>, and <i>Fusicatenibacter</i> at the genus level in children with PA. Non-targeted metabolomics detected 1168 different metabolites between children with PA and HC. Functional analysis of the gut microbiota and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of differential metabolites between the PA and HC groups corroborated that the pathways of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, and pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis were down-regulated in children with PA, while the pathways of ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis, tyrosine metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism were up-regulated in children with PA. The correlation analysis highlighted meaningful associations between the altered microbiota and specific metabolic profiles, further underscoring the complex interplay between microbial composition and metabolic function in the pathogenesis of PA in children. This study provides new evidence of the pathogenesis of PA. There are significant differences in the gut microbiota, metabolites, and metabolic pathways between HC and children with PA, and the differences in metabolites are related to specific changes in bacterial abundance. These findings provide a foundation for future studies aimed at exploring targeted microbiome-based therapeutic strategies for managing PA in pediatric populations.",Ma H; Fang J; Li M; Qin Y; Wang Y; Kang SG; Huang K; Tong T,Frontiers in microbiology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40746318/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40745546,"Association between a low-carbohydrate diet and macronutrient intake with the gut microbiome, and their interaction with dyslipidemia among Korean adults.","The prevalence of dyslipidemia has increased in recent years; however, it remains a modifiable condition through diet and gut microbiome modulation. Yet, evidence from population-based studies remains limited. This study aimed to investigate the relationships among a low-carbohydrate diet (LCD), macronutrient intake, and the gut microbiome, and to evaluate their interaction effects on dyslipidemia in a Korean population. Data were drawn from two population-based studies: the Korean Microbiome Study (KMS) and the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). We included 2,178 participants aged 20–80 years from the KMS (2017–2019) and 12,938 participants from the KNHANES (2017–2019). The LCD score and percentage of energy intake from macronutrients were calculated using either a food frequency questionnaire or a 24-hour dietary recall. Dyslipidemia was assessed based on fasting blood tests. Gut microbiota was profiled by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene in the KMS. Multivariate logistic regression models including interaction terms were used to evaluate the joint effects of diet and the gut microbiome on dyslipidemia. A higher LCD score was associated with lower odds of atherogenic dyslipidemia and low high–density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterolemia in both studies. Although both studies showed a positive trend for fat intake and a negative trend for carbohydrate intake in relation to hypercholesterolemia, the level of significance differed slightly. We identified 38 microbial genera associated with LCD score and macronutrient intake. Notably, fat intake showed beneficial associations with triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levels in individuals carrying <i>Bifidobacterium</i> (p for interaction = 0.0017) and <i>Lachnospiraceae UCG–</i>004 (p for interaction = 0.0482), respectively. In contrast, low carbohydrate intake was associated with increased odds of hypercholesterolemia in individuals harboring <i>Lachnoclostridium</i> (odds ratio: 3.79; 95% confidence interval: 2.01–7.17; p for interaction < 0.0001). No significant associations were observed in individuals lacking these genera. Similar interaction effects were observed at the amplicon sequence variant level for <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and <i>Lachnospiraceae UCG–004</i>. These findings provide population-based evidence for the interactive role of fat and carbohydrate intake with gut microbiota in influencing dyslipidemia among Koreans.

40732984,Gut Microbiota Shifts After a Weight Loss Program in Adults with Obesity: The WLM3P Study.,"The gut microbiota is increasingly recognized as a key modulator in obesity management, influencing host energy balance, lipid metabolism, and inflammatory pathways. With obesity prevalence continuing to rise globally, dietary interventions that promote beneficial microbial shifts are essential for enhancing weight loss outcomes and long-term health. This study investigated the effects of the multicomponent Weight Loss Maintenance 3 Phases Program (WLM3P), which integrates caloric restriction, a high-protein low-carbohydrate diet, time-restricted eating (10h TRE), dietary supplementation (prebiotics and phytochemicals), and digital app-based support on gut microbiota composition compared to a standard low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) in adults with obesity. The analysis focused exclusively on the 6-month weight loss period corresponding to Phases 1 and 2 of the WLM3P intervention. In this sub-analysis of a randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04192357), 58 adults with obesity (BMI 30.0-39.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were randomized to the WLM3P (<i>n</i> = 29) or LCD (<i>n</i> = 29) groups. Stool samples were collected at baseline and 6 months for 16S rRNA sequencing. Alpha and beta diversity were assessed, and genus-level differential abundance was determined using EdgeR and LEfSe. Associations between microbial taxa and clinical outcomes were evaluated using regression models. After 6-month, the WLM3P group showed a significant increase in alpha diversity (<i>p</i> = 0.03) and a significant change in beta diversity (<i>p</i> < 0.01), while no significant changes were observed in the LCD group. Differential abundance analysis revealed specific microbial signatures in WLM3P participants, including increased levels of <i>Faecalibacterium</i>. Notably, higher <i>Faecalibacterium</i> abundance was associated with greater reductions in fat mass (kg, %) and visceral adiposity (cm<sup>2</sup>) in the WLM3P group compared to LCD (<i>p</i> < 0.01). These findings suggest a potential microbiota-mediated mechanism in weight loss, where <i>Faecalibacterium</i> may enhance fat reduction effectiveness in the context of the WLM3P intervention.",Pereira V; Cuevas-Sierra A; de la O V; Salvado R; Barreiros-Mota I; Castela I; Camelo A; Brandão I; Santo CE; Faria A; Calhau C; Silvestre MP; Moreira-Rosário A,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40732984/,0,0,0,0,1,0
40732463,Towards Precision Nutrition: A Novel Smartphone-Connected Biosensor for Point-of-Care Detection of β-Hydroxybutyrate in Human Blood and Saliva.,"Precision nutrition is an emerging approach that tailors dietary recommendations based on an individual's unique genetic, metabolic, microbiome, and lifestyle factors. β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB) is a key ketone body produced during fat metabolism, especially in states of fasting, low-carbohydrate intake, or prolonged exercise. Therefore, monitoring β-HB levels provides valuable insights into an individual's metabolic state, making it an essential biomarker for precision and personalized nutrition. A smartphone-connected electrochemical biosensor for single-use, rapid, low-cost, accurate, and selective detection of β-HB in whole blood and saliva at the Point-of-Care (POC) is reported. A graphite screen-printed carbon electrode modified with potassium ferricyanide (Fe(III)GSPE) was used as an electrode platform for the deposition of β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidized form (NAD<sup>+</sup>), and chitosan nanoparticles (ChitNPs). An outer poly(vinyl) chloride (PVC) diffusion-limiting membrane was used to protect the modified electrode. The biosensor showed a linear range in the clinically relevant range, between 0.4 and 8 mM, with a detection limit (LOD) of 0.1 mM. The biosensor was tested on human blood and saliva samples, and the results were compared to those obtained with a commercial ketone meter, showing excellent agreement.",Tortolini C; Caprio M; Gianfrilli D; Lenzi A; Antiochia R,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40732463/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40609948,Pickering emulsion gels stabilized by sardine protein/konjac glucomannan complexes delivering astaxanthin for alleviating inflammatory bowel disease.,"Astaxanthin (AXT) alleviates inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by reducing inflammation, blocking NF-κB pathway, and modulating gut microbiota. However, the poor solubility and low bioavailability of AXT limit its applications in food. In this study, sardine protein (SDP)/konjac glucomannan (KGM)-stabilized Pickering emulsion gels (SKEGs) were developed for AXT delivery for IBD intervention. Initially, the primary interactions between SDP and KGM were identified as hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. The addition of KGM effectively enhanced the interfacial adsorption capacity and wettability of SDP. Notably, at a KGM concentration of 1.2 %, the formed Pickering emulsion exhibited a more uniform and denser microstructure, with an oil droplet size of 7.12 ± 0.14 μm. Furthermore, the incorporation of konjac glucomannan (KGM) significantly improved the emulsion stability under the conditions of high temperature, high ionic strength and long-term storage. After 14 h of ultraviolet irradiation and heating, the retention rate of AXT in SKEGs was markedly higher than that of free AXT. Simulated digestion experiments revealed that SKEGs improved the bioavailability of AXT by reducing the release of AXT in stomach. In vivo mouse experiments demonstrated that the AXT-loaded SKEGs effectively alleviated weight loss and colon shortening induced by dextran sodium sulfate, and protected the integrity of colon tissue by regulating inflammatory factor levels s and restoring the expression of tight junction proteins including ZO-1 and occludin. Additionally, the AXT-loaded SKEGs restored the gut microbiota composition in IBD mice by reducing harmful bacteria and enriching beneficial species. This study presented a novel strategy for improving the biological accessibility of AXT in functional food formulations, simultaneously facilitating the efficient utilization of ocean resources.",Liang J; Ma J; Sun Y; Su W; Cheng S,International journal of biological macromolecules,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40609948/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40599091,A Moderately High-Protein Diet During the Critical Development Period Protects Hepatic Functional Integrity and Improves Metabolic Health in Middle-Aged Offspring via the Gut-Liver Axis.,"A high-protein diet (HP) in early life has long-term effects on the metabolism and liver health of offspring. However, few studies focus on the impact of early nutritional status on the more disease-susceptible midlife period. Here, we elucidate a moderately HP during critical development and the underlying mechanisms for liver function and metabolic health in middle-aged offspring. Pregnant Wistar rats are given a 6-week dietary intervention with a control diet and a moderately HP during gestation and lactation. The maternal high-protein diet (mHP) group increases energy expenditure, preventing liver fat accumulation and alleviating systemic inflammation of middle-aged offspring. Additionally, the mHP group reshapes offspring gut microbiota, significantly increasing the abundance of Clostridia_vadinBB60_group, Ruminococcaceae_UBA1819, Flavonifractor, and Butyricicoccaceae_UCG-009. Metabolomics and transcriptomics reveal that mHP maintains energy homeostasis in middle-aged offspring by altering serum amino acid, organic acid, and fatty acid profiles and activating the hepatic AMPK/SREBP-1c pathway to preserve liver integrity via the gut-liver axis. We also demonstrate in the Drosophila model that mHP increases AMPK levels and alleviates lipid accumulation in the gut and fat body of middle-aged flies. These findings provide valuable insights into the pivotal role of prenatal nutrition in offspring's long-term health.",Li Y; Xu W; Kong X; Dong Y; An M; Guan Y; Wang R; Huang H; Hu S; Cai L; Niu Y,Molecular nutrition & food research,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40599091/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Each cluster had a distinct topological structure within the microbial interaction network, underscoring its diverse roles in maintaining microbial communities. Cluster II, predominated by Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium, was consistently found across individuals and centrally located within the microbial interaction network. Cluster III, mainly composed of Oscillospira and Coprococcus, and IV, dominated by Enterobacteriaceae and Bacteroides fragilis, demonstrated mutually exclusive relationships, reflecting affinities for host clusters with varied dietary patterns and microbial diversity. Clusters V and VI linked different microbial clusters, and cluster I had separate subcommunities.

40593990,The effects of candidate probiotic strains on the gut environment in dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis mouse.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition characterized by intestinal inflammation and dysbiosis, with limited treatment options and significant challenges in long-term management. This study investigated the therapeutic potential of novel strains belonging to Bifidobacterium longum and Limosilactobacillus species, in a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced mouse model of colitis. In this study, our primary objective was to determine whether ingestion of these strains alleviates colitis symptoms and, if so, to elucidate how they restored gut microbial balance and modulated microbial metabolic functions. In most probiotic-treated groups, colitis disease activity index scores were significantly improved and colon length was preserved, with strains CBA7106 and BBH exhibiting efficacy comparable to that of the Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (used as a positive control). Moreover, histological analyses confirmed reduced inflammation and enhanced mucosal integrity. Microbial diversity assessments demonstrated a marked restoration of gut microbial composition, highlighted by increased abundances of beneficial taxa such as Lactobacillus and Akkermansia. Metabolomic profiling identified key anti-inflammatory metabolites, including 6-hydroxycaproic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, and choline, which were significantly elevated in the probiotic-treated groups. Notably, functional analyses using PICRUSt2 revealed a sustained decrease in the siderophore biosynthesis pathway (ko01053), suggesting that these candidate probiotic strains may inhibit siderophore production-a pivotal mechanism by which pathogenic bacteria aggravate intestinal inflammation. Taken together, these findings indicate that the candidate probiotic strains CBA7106 and BBH effectively mitigate DSS-induced colitis by modulating the gut microbiota, promoting the production of anti-inflammatory metabolites, and suppressing siderophore biosynthesis.

40592152,Zearalenone induces intestinal damage and flora disturbance in rats by triggering ferroptosis via the system Xc<sup>-</sup>-GSH-GPX4 signaling pathway.,"Zearalenone (ZEA) is a mycotoxin commonly found in contaminated grains. The colon, a primary site of ZEA exposure, serves as a barrier to prevent its systemic entry. Ferroptosis signaling in intestinal epithelial cells is associated with increased intestinal inflammation. However, the role of ferroptosis in ZEA-induced gut injury is unclear. This study examined the effects of ZEA on ferroptosis signaling in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (5 mg/kg body weight, gavage for three weeks) and Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells (20 μM, 24-hour treatment). ZEA exposure significantly increased intestinal permeability in rats and reduced transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in Caco-2 cells. The mRNA expression analysis and protein analyses revealed a marked reduction in tight junction protein expression and increased pro-inflammatory cytokines. ZEA treatment also led to significant iron accumulation in both rat colonic tissue and Caco-2 cells, accompanied by mitochondrial shrinkage and cristae reduction, indicating ferroptosis induction. Further analysis showed that ZEA suppressed system Xc<sup>-</sup> (SLC7A11 and SLC3A2) expression, reducing glutathione (GSH) levels and down-regulating GPX4, thereby impairing lipid peroxidation clearance. Additionally, ZEA exposure altered gut microbiota composition by decreasing beneficial bacteria and increasing harmful ones, with these microbial changes correlating with ferroptosis markers. In conclusion, ZEA induces colonic ferroptosis by disrupting the system Xc<sup>-</sup>-GSH-GPX4 axis, and gut microbiota alterations may contribute to this process.",Huangfu B; Li J; Xu T; Ren X; Zhang R; Chen Y; Wang J; Huang K; He X,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40592152/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40591436,The Role of Precision Nutrition in Kidney Disease.,"Precision nutrition uses an individualized approach in which dietary interventions are tailored according to patients' genetic, biologic, and environmental factors. There are various nutritional guidelines specific to patients with CKD, and while rigorous, they provide generalized recommendations that may not fully address the unique nutritional needs of individual patients. For example, while guidelines endorse prescription of low-protein diets among people with metabolically stable stages 3-5 non-dialysis-dependent CKD to reduce kidney disease progression, these recommendations do not fully account for the genetic, metabolic, or physiologic factors that affect how different patients respond to specific dietary interventions. Furthermore, older patients with CKD may require different levels of protein intake compared with younger individuals, given that aging affects protein metabolism. In contrast to conventional nutritional management approaches, which typically use a one-size-fits-all model, precision nutrition and personalized nutrition use an individualized approach. Although the terms precision nutrition and personalized nutrition are sometimes used interchangeably, there are nuanced differences in their definitions such that precision nutrition is more data-driven and uses precise information ( e.g ., genetic, microbiome, and metabolic) to inform management, whereas personalized nutrition encompasses a broader approach that also takes into consideration factors such as lifestyle, environment, and patients' preferences. Precision nutrition is evolving rapidly with advances in data collection, deep data analysis, and modeling with application of artificial intelligence, while personalized nutrition is what we practice today leveraging available data and guidelines to meet each individual patient's needs. Numerous advancements have led to a growing armamentarium of tools in precision nutrition, including nutrigenetics, nutrigenomics, microbiome profiling, metabolomics, and proteomics, which can be leveraged to guide dietary recommendations according to an individual's unique characteristics. In this review, we examine the role of precision nutrition in CKD, tools used in precision medicine, and practical application of these approaches in treating patients with kidney disease.",Narasaki Y; Rhee CM; Li Z,Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40591436/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40586597,A three-country analysis of the gut microbiome indicates taxon associations with diet vary by taxon resolution and population.,"Emerging research suggests that diet plays a vital role in shaping the composition and function of the gut microbiota. Although substantial efforts have been made to identify general patterns linking diet to the gut microbiome, much of this research has been concentrated on a small number of countries. Additionally, both diet and the gut microbiome have highly complex and individualized configurations, and there is growing evidence that tailoring diets to individual gut microbiota profiles may optimize the path toward improving or maintaining health and preventing disease. Using fecal metagenomic data from 1,177 individuals across three countries, we examine the relationship between diet and bacterial genera, focusing on <i>Prevotella</i> and <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, which have gained significant attention for their potential roles in human health and strong associations with dietary patterns. We find that these two genera in particular show significant associations with many aspects of diet but these associations vary in scale and direction, depending on the level of metagenomic resolution (i.e., genus level by reads and strain level by metagenome-assembled genomes) and the contextual population. These results highlight the growing importance of building metagenomic data sets that are standardized, comprehensive, and representative of diverse populations to increase our ability to tease apart the complex relationship between diet and the microbiome. An analysis of fecal microbiome data from individuals in the United States, United Kingdom, and Mexico shows that associations with dietary components vary both by country and by level of resolution (i.e., genus and strain). Our work sheds light on why there may be conflicting reports regarding microbial associations with diet, disease, and health.",Khatib L; Song SJ; Dilmore AH; Sanders JG; Brennan C; Hernandez AR; Myers T; Oles R; Farmer S; Cowart C; Birmingham A; Diaz EA; Nizet O; Gilbert K; Litwin N; Das P; Nowinski B; Bryant M; Tribelhorn C; Sanders-Bodai K; Chaumont S; Knol J; Roeselers G; Laiola M; Shetty SA; Veiga P; Tap J; Derrien M; Koutnikova H; Cotillard A; Lay C; Tovar AR; Torres N; Arteaga L; González A; McDonald D; Bartko A; Knight R,mSystems,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40586597/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40582206,Parishin from Gastrodia elata ameliorates DSS induced colitis and anxiety-like behavior in mice by regulating intestinal barrier function and microviota-gut-brain axis.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including colitis, are commonly associated with dysfunctional intestinal barriers and dysregulated gut microbiota. Moreover, current medications for IBD cause serious side effects with prolonged use. Parishin, a phenolic glucoside isolated from Gastrodia elata, is known for its medicinal value in anti-aging properties. However, the therapeutic effects of Parishin on colitis and the underlying mechanisms remain largely unexplored. The aim of this study was to examine the protective effects of Parishin on colitis and related anxiety mood disorder in mice, as well as to explore its potential mechanisms. This study employed a DSS-induced colitis mouse model to evaluate Parishin's therapeutic effects. Mice were divided into control, model, and Parishin treatment groups, followed by DAI, histopathology, inflammatory cytokines, gut barrier proteins, gene expression, behavioral changes, and gut microbiota composition. We demonstrated that Parishin alleviated symptoms such as weight loss, a colon shortening, and a high disease activity index in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model. Parishin strengthened the intestinal barrier by increasing the expression of tight junction proteins and mucin. Furthermore, Parishin significantly reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum, colon and spleen of mice with DSS. Notably, Parishin treatment attenuated DSS-induced anxiety-like behavior by activating GABA receptors and regulating the FKBP5 level. Gut microbiota analysis showed that Parishin restored the DSS-disturbed microbiota of the mice. These findings demonstrate that Parishin may attenuate DSS-induced colitis and anxiety-like behavior by enhancing the intestinal barrier and regulating the gut microbiota, supporting the development of a Parishin-based strategy for IBD prevention or treatment.",Liu X; Zhou H; Yang N; Yang LJ; Zi ZY; Han YL; He J; Su LY,Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40582206/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Shi improve high-fat diet-induced obesity in mice by inhibiting lipid accumulation and regulating the gut microbiota.,"Obesity is a complex disease associated with poor dietary habits and the gut microbiota. <i>Rosa sterilis</i> S. D. Shi contains abundant flavonoids, which have significant antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-obesity effects. Flavonoids from <i>Rosa sterilis</i> S. D. Shi (FRS) are bioactive compounds with multiple activities. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether and how the FRS can alleviate high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity in mice. Our results suggested that there are significant reductions in obesity-related phenotypes after 12 weeks of FRS intervention in HFD-induced mice. FRS significantly reduced weight gain, minimized liver damage, and restored liver and epididymal fat morphology in mice with HFD. Furthermore, FRS increased the population of beneficial bacteria <i>Akkermansia</i>, which helped counteract obesity, thereby improving glucose homeostasis and reducing lipid accumulation by modulating the gut microbiota composition. In conclusion, as a non-toxic and biologically active natural ingredient, FRS has the potential to prevent obesity and related metabolic disorders, and is expected to become a functional ingredient for researching anti-obesity and improving consumer health. This study provides a theoretical foundation and technical support for developing functional FRS products and underscores the importance of FRS in anti-obesity research and the advanced utilization of <i>Rosa sterilis</i> S.

40550677,[Development of a dietary factor evaluation method based on the gut microbiota health index].,"The gut microbiota is closely related to human health, and various gut microbiota health indices have been developed to assist in evaluating the health of the gut microbiota and even the overall health of the human body. Diets are one of the main factors that regulate the gut microbiota, while there is still no good method for evaluating the regulatory effects of dietary factors. To assess the regulatory effects of dietary factors on the gut microbiota of overweight individuals, we conducted an <i>in vitro</i> fermentation experiment based on 17 dietary factors, and developed an evaluation method for the regulatory effects of dietary factors based on the health index with principal component analysis (hiPCA). The results showed that most dietary factors had positive regulatory effects on the gut microbiota of overweight individuals. Galactooligosaccharides (GOS) and puerarin were the most significant dietary factors in regulating the gut microbiota of overweight individuals. The analysis of the contribution of species to the hiPCA indicated that GOS and puerarin might inhibit the activities of bacteria associated with overweight by regulating <i>Eubacterium dolichum</i>, <i>Lactobacillus salivarius</i>, <i>Clostridium clostridioforme</i>, <i>Clostridium citroniae</i>, and Lachnospiraceae bacterium 9_1_43BFAA. In addition, GOS may further enhance the inhibition of these activities by regulating Lachnospiraceae bacterium 6_1_63FAA, thereby reducing the gut health risks in overweight individuals. In summary, this study evaluated the health effects of dietary factors based on the hiPCA and specifically analyzed the role of different dietary factors in regulating the gut microbiota of overweight individuals. This provides new ideas and methods for improving gut microbiota health and has potential applications in the field of precision nutrition.",Yang Z; Xie H; Zhu J; Wang H; Lu W,Sheng wu gong cheng xue bao = Chinese journal of biotechnology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40550677/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Vitamins B1 and B2 may influence these outcomes by modulating gut microbiota. This study aimed to examine the relationships among mental health indicators, gut microbiota, and levels of vitamins B1 and B2. <i>Methods</i>: This study conducted a cross-sectional analysis to explore associations between mental health status, gut microbiota composition and function, and circulating vitamin B1/B2 levels. Ten representative microbes were selected for analysis. Mediation models were used to assess whether gut microbiota mediate the effects of vitamins on mental health. <i>Results:</i> Vitamin B1 and B2 levels were significantly associated with stress, sleep quality, and sleepiness (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The abundance of specific gut microbiota also showed significant inter-correlations (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Specific gut microbiota abundances are correlated with host anxiety, stress, sleep, and sleepiness levels (<i>p</i> < 0.05). We did not observe significant differences in the abundance of specific gut microbiota associated with different vitamin B1 and B2 nutritional levels in the host (<i>p</i> > 0.05). Gut microbial diversity and composition varied notably between different vitamin level groups and anxiety, stress, sleep quality, and sleepiness groups. Although both vitamin B2 and <i>Bacteroides</i> had significant direct effects on sleep quality (<i>p</i> < 0.05), no mediating effect of <i>Bacteroides</i> was observed (<i>p</i> > 0.05). <i>Conclusions:</i> These findings suggest potential associations between vitamins B1 and B2 and mental health, as well as between gut microbiota and host psychological outcomes; no significant mediating effect of the microbiota was observed.

40507144,In Search of Healthy Ageing: A Microbiome-Based Precision Nutrition Approach for Type 2 Diabetes Prevention.,"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and in Spain, particularly in the elderly population, affecting healthy ageing. Nutritional strategies are key to its prevention. The gut microbiota is also implicated in T2D and can be modulated by nutrition. We hypothesize that precision nutrition through microbiota modulation may help prevent T2D. This article aims to (1) describe a gut microbiota bacterial profile associated with T2D prevention, (2) provide precision nutrition tools to optimize this profile, (3) analyze how overweight influences the microbiota composition and precision nutrition response, and (4) address the technical challenges of microbiome-based precision nutrition clinical implementation to prevent T2D. <b>Methods</b>: A review of gut microbiota associated with T2D prevention was conducted. 13 healthy Spanish participants over 62 with optimal blood glucose levels (7 normal weight and 6 overweight) underwent a 3-month precision nutrition intervention to optimize T2D-preventive gut microbiota using a bioinformatics food recommendation system, Phymofood (EP22382095). Fecal microbiota was analyzed pre- and post-intervention using full-length 16S rRNA gene amplification, MinION sequencing, and NCBI taxonomic classification. <b>Results</b>: 31 potentially preventive bacteria against T2D were selected. The intervention increased the relative abundance of beneficial genera (<i>Butyrivibrio</i> and <i>Faecalibacterium</i>) and species (<i>Eshraghiella crossota</i>, and <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i>). The overweight influenced microbiota composition and intervention response. <b>Conclusions</b>: A gut microbiota profile associated with T2D prevention was identified, and precision nutrition could increase the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria. Confounding factors such as overweight should be considered when designing microbiome-based precision nutrition interventions.

40482732,Effect of viable and inactivated Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG administration on the prevention of diet-induced obesity in rats: Implication of white and brown adipose tissue and influence of bacterial viability.,"Obesity is one of the most prevalent chronic metabolic alterations worldwide being highly related to an increased risk for further associated co-morbidities. Current evidence indicates that subjects with obesity have a distinct gut microbiota signature, emphasizing gut microbiota composition as a potential mediating factor. The aim of this research is to evaluate the potential effects of viable and heat-inactivated Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in the prevention of diet-induced obesity in a rat model. The administration of the probiotic or its heat-inactivated postbiotic partially prevented diet-induced WAT increase in a similar manner. While viable probiotic administration resulted in a reduced lipid uptake (LPL) and de novo lipogenesis (FAS), along with enhanced lipolysis (ATGL) in WAT, its heat-inactivated postbiotic mainly acted reducing de novo lipogenesis. Additionally, the obtained results demonstrated that probiotic administration enhanced thermogenesis (UCP1) and fatty acid oxidation (CPT-1b) on BAT, as well as upregulated several markers involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (p38 MAPK, NRF1 and CS). By contrast, despite the administration of the postbiotic upregulated thermogenesis and fatty acid oxidation in a comparable manner as the probiotic, these results were not accompanied by changes in mitochondrial biogenesis markers. These results indicate that under the specific experimental conditions tested, both the administration of viable and heat-inactivated Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG present valuable potential for preventing diet-induced WAT mass increase in rats. While both treatments exerted similar effects on WAT and BAT, subtle differences that may derive from bacterial viability were observed in the involved mechanisms of action.",Arellano-García L; Portillo MP; Martínez JA; Krisa S; Milton-Laskibar I,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40482732/,0,0,0,0,0,0

40374164,"Three decades of the Mediterranean diet pyramid: A narrative review of its history, evolution, and advances.","The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) pyramid was officially published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 1995. Since then, our understanding of the role of the MedDiet and its role in reducing risk of chronic diseases has grown substantially. This article aims to provide a narrative review of the historical context of the MedDiet and its environmental impact, summarize health-related evidence from the past 3 decades, and explore its practical applications and cultural adaptations. Relevant studies were identified through searches of PubMed and other major databases. We prioritzed publications from the past 3 decades, while also including influential earlier studies where appropriate. Evidence was synthesized qualitatively to summarize key findings and identify gaps for future research. A large body of evidence from prospective cohort studies, randomized controlled trials, and mechanistic studies consistently supports the benefits of the MedDiet for the prevention of chronic diseases, particularly cardiometabolic diseases and the improvement of healthy aging. Growing evidence demonstrates that the MedDiet promotes favorable changes in circulating metabolites and gut microbiome composition, providing novel insights into biological mechanisms underlying its health benefits and informing the development of precision nutrition strategies. The MedDiet aligns with the principles of the planetary health diet recommended by the EAT-Lancet Commission, which aims to promote both human health and environmental sustainability. The development of the MedDiet pyramid 30 y ago inspired the creation of the Asian, African, and Latin-American heritage diet pyramids. Over the past 3 decades, substantial evidence has accumulated to strongly support the benefits of the MedDiet in preventing chronic diseases and promoting healthy aging.

Gut microbiota significantly influences obesity, yet causal relationships and underlying pathways remain elusive. The objective of the study was to investigate causal relationships between gut microbiota, metabolites, and obesity; elucidate potential pathways mediating obesity onset; identify novel genes; and explore the impact of plasma proteins on obesity risk. Bidirectional and two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) were used to explore causal relationships. Mediation analyses identified mechanisms linking gut microbiota, metabolites, and obesity. Pathway analyses and protein-protein interaction assessed genetic and protein associations. The MR analysis results identified 11 gut microbiota species with causal associations with obesity, 69 metabolites that were significantly causally related to obesity, and seven bacteria with causal relationships, mediated by metabolites. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)-related gene set enrichment analysis revealed clustering in a concentration of genes enriched for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB/AKT) and plasma membrane-related signaling pathways. Fms-related receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT1), growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), and SLIT and NTRK-like family member 1 (SLITRK1) plasma proteins had protective effects against obesity. This study revealed causal links between gut bacteria, metabolites, and obesity, and identified potential therapeutic targets. Findings deepen understanding of obesity's complex mechanisms and suggest novel prevention and treatment strategies, emphasizing the gut microbiota and treatment targets. This study pioneered the use of genetic approaches and mediator analyses to confirm the causal relationship between gut microbiota, metabolites, and obesity, and also explored how these factors work together to promote obesity through specific signaling pathways and protein interactions.

40369689,Milk phospholipid-coated lipid droplets modulate the infant gut microbiota and metabolome influencing weight gain.,"The supramolecular structure and composition of milk fat globules in breast milk is complex. Lipid droplets in formula milk are typically smaller compared to human milk and differ in their lipid and protein composition. These droplets play an important role in gut and immune maturation, and their components possess antimicrobial and antiviral properties. Here, the influence of a concept infant formula (IF) containing large milk phospholipid-coated lipid droplets on the maturation of the infant microbiota, metabolome, and weight gain in the first year of life was investigated. Formula-fed infants were randomized to receive either a standard IF (Control) or a Test formula containing large milk phospholipid-coated lipid droplets (Test) until 17 weeks of age. A breast-fed Reference group was also investigated. At 3 months of age, several taxa identified as opportunistic pathogens (e.g., Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Streptococcus) were less abundant in the Test stools compared to Control, while an enrichment of the butyrate-producing Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae was observed. These findings indicate that the Test formula resulted in gut microbiota maturation trajectories more comparable to healthy breast-fed infants. This was accompanied by variation in several fecal and plasma metabolites at 3 months of age related to gut microbial metabolism including bile acids, hippurate, phenylacetylglycine, trimethylamine, and various lipids and fatty acids. At 12 months, measures of subcutaneous fat and body mass index (BMI) were significantly higher in infants receiving standard IF compared to those receiving breast milk. However, this weight gain and adiposity was attenuated in the Test group infants. The presence of large phospholipid-coated lipid droplets in formula milk positively influenced the development of the infants' gut microbiota, their metabolomic profiles, and their body composition to more closely resemble breast-fed infants compared to standard IF. These droplets may further enhance the restriction of pathogenic bacteria seen with standard infant formula and suggest a potential impact on infant metabolic programming that may contribute to physiological development.

40362727,Effects of Celastrol-Enriched Peanuts on Metabolic Health and the Development of Atherosclerosis.,"Celastrol, a pentacyclic triterpenoid active component isolated from the root bark of the traditional medicinal plant Tripterygium wilfordii, displays significant anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory properties. However, its clinical application remains limited due to inadequate bioavailability. Regarding these issues, we innovatively developed a novel peanut cultivar (cel-peanut) enriched with celastrol through distant hybridization combined with metabolomics screening. Guided by the research concept of ""natural anti-inflammatory diets for metabolic disease management"", we established a high-fat diet-induced <i>ApoE</i><sup>-/-</sup> atherosclerotic mouse model to systematically evaluate the anti-atherosclerosis effects and mechanisms of cel-peanut. Our results revealed that cel-peanut significantly reduced serum levels of triglycerides (TGs) and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Concurrently, cel-peanut markedly decreased the atherosclerotic lesion area and enhanced collagen content within plaques. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that cel-peanut reduced serum malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and suppressed the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in atherosclerotic lesions. Furthermore, cel-peanut promoted intestinal health by modulating the composition and functionality of gut microbiota, thereby attenuating atherosclerosis progression. Overall, these findings indicate that cel-peanut exerts therapeutic effects against atherosclerosis through its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and gut microbiota-modulating properties.

40328731,Timing of unsaturated fat intake improves insulin sensitivity via the gut microbiota-bile acid axis: a randomized controlled trial.,"The timing of dietary total fat intake influences glucose homeostasis, however, the impact of unsaturated fat (USFA) intake has yet to be explored. This 12-week, double-blind, randomized, controlled, 2 × 2 factorial-designed feeding trial investigated the effects of timing (lunch or dinner) and types of dietary USFA (high monounsaturated fat or polyunsaturated fat diet) intake on glucose metabolism in seventy prediabetes participants (mean age, 57 years). Sixty participants with completed fecal samples were included in the final analysis (n = 15 for each group). Postprandial serum glucose was first primary outcome, postprandial insulin levels and insulin sensitivity indices were co-primary outcomes Secondary outcomes were continuous glucose levels, serum fatty acid profile, gut microbiome (metagenomic sequencing) and fecal metabolites. Results showed no significant differences in postprandial glucose between groups. However, USFA intake at lunch (vs. dinner) improved insulin sensitivity and reduced postprandial insulin and serum free saturated fatty acid (P<sub>timing</sub> < 0.05, P<sub>type</sub> > 0.05, P<sub>interaction</sub> > 0.05), which was associated with alterations in gut microbiome and bile acid metabolism, regardless of USFA type.

40320851,Development of a Korean Nutrition Model for In Silico Gut Microbiome Analyses Integrated With Nutrigenomics.,"The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in human health and disease, with diet serving as a critical determinant of microbial composition and metabolic function. However, most existing nutrition databases are Western-centric, lacking comprehensive dietary information for non-Western populations, including Koreans. This limitation hinders the accuracy of in silico gut microbiome analyses and microbiome-disease associations. We developed the Korean Nutrition Model (KNM) to enhance in silico microbiome analyses by incorporating detailed macronutrient and micronutrient compositions reflective of Korean dietary patterns. KNM was constructed using a decision algorithm that integrates data from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety and FooDB. Comparative analysis with the European Nutrition Model revealed significant differences in carbohydrate and vitamin compositions, which in turn influenced microbial growth rates and metabolic fluxes in in silico simulations. We further evaluated gut microbiota differences between Korean and European cohorts, including healthy individuals and inflammatory bowel disease patients. Our findings demonstrate that using an appropriate, population-specific nutrition model significantly improves microbiome analyses, reducing the risk of false associations. This study underscores the importance of regionally tailored dietary models and provides a framework for enhancing global dietary models to facilitate precision nutrition and microbiome-based disease interventions.",Kim KS; Yang SY; Jeong H; Hong M; Noh J; Koh H; Lee DW,Molecular nutrition & food research,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40320851/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40317047,Inverted day-night feeding during pregnancy affects the brain health of both maternal and fetal brains through increasing inflammation levels associated with dysbiosis of the gut microbiome in rats.,"In both humans and rodents, inappropriate feeding times during pregnancy can cause maternal metabolic abnormalities, increasing the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in both the mother and offspring. Using a rat model, this study investigates whether feeding only during the inactive phase in rats leads to anxiety-like behaviors and abnormal brain development in fetuses through gut microbiota imbalance. 10-week-old female rats in the inactive-phase feeding group (IF group) were first trained for daytime feeding, ensuring that energy intake was statistically insignificant and different from that of the normal diet feeding group (ND group). They were then paired with male rats, and the previous feeding regimen was continued after pregnancy. Anxiety-like behavior was evaluated using the open-field test. Maternal caecal microbiota was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) measured serum inflammation factors. RT-PCR was employed to assess mRNA levels of integrity genes and inflammatory cytokines in the maternal hippocampi, intestines, fetal brains, and placentae. There were no statistically significant differences in energy intake or body weight gain between the IF and ND groups. In the open field test, dams in the IF group exhibited anxiety-like behavior, as indicated by fewer entries into and shorter duration in the central zone. Active-phase fasting elevated maternal serum inflammatory cytokine levels and impaired antioxidant capacity. It also increased intestinal permeability and induced gut microbiota dysbiosis, characterized by a decrease in Akkermansia and an increase in Dubosiella. Changes in the expression of intestinal circadian genes and elevated intestinal inflammatory cytokines were observed. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) translocated into the maternal circulation, activated Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4), and passed through the compromised placental barrier into the fetal brain, leading to increased expression of inflammatory cytokines in the fetal brain. The misalignment between maternal feeding time and the biological clock during pregnancy disrupts the balance of the gut microbiota and peripheral rhythms. The impaired intestinal and placental barriers allow LPS from the gut to infiltrate the maternal hippocampus and fetal brain, increasing inflammation and impacting both maternal and fetal brain health.",Wang X; Kong X; Ding Y; An M; Zhu X; Guan Y; Niu Y,Journal of neuroinflammation,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40317047/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40290047,Identification and Anti-Fatigue Activity of Walnut Protein Hydrolysate.,"<b>Objective:</b> This study aims to investigate the structural and functional characteristics of walnut protein hydrolysates (WPHs) with different molecular weights prepared using protease from Dregea sinensis Hemsl, as well as the anti-fatigue effects of low-molecular-weight walnut protein hydrolysates (LWPs) and their impact on the cecal microbiota and faecal metabolism of mice. <b>Methods:</b> The anti-fatigue activity of WPHs with different molecular weights was evaluated, and the LWPs were analyzed in a centralized manner. A 28-day gavage study was conducted to assess LWP's anti-fatigue benefits in mice, supplemented by metabolomic analysis to explore its impact on metabolic pathways. <b>Results:</b> Our findings revealed that LWP significantly outperformed unhydrolyzed walnut protein (WP) in terms of water retention, lipid retention, emulsifying properties, and foaming capacity. Notably, differential protein expression associated with LWP highlighted pathways related to antioxidant activity. In vivo studies showed that LWP markedly enhanced glycogen storage in the muscles and liver of mice, while reducing serum levels of serum urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase, blood lactic acid, and creatine kinase. Furthermore, the levels of Superoxide Dismutase and Glutathione were significantly elevated, alongside a reduction in Malondialdehyde, indicating that LWP's anti-fatigue effect is closely linked to improved oxidative stress resistance. Additionally, LWP promoted beneficial increases in microbial populations such as <i>Akkermansia</i>, <i>Alistipes</i>, <i>Eubacterium</i>, and <i>Muribaculum</i>, which are associated with enhanced fatigue resistance. Metabolomic analysis indicated significant enrichment in glycerophospholipid metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis, identifying key metabolites including palmitoylethanolamide and 4-methyl-5-thiazoleethanol, both of which are integral to health maintenance. <b>Conclusions:</b> LWP demonstrates a robust anti-fatigue effect, supported by its accessibility, straightforward preparation, and eco-friendly characteristics. These attributes suggest that LWP has promising potential for inclusion in health products aimed at enhancing vitality and combating fatigue.",Huang S; Wang Y; Li M; Mu H; Tan C; Wang M; Zhang F; Sheng J; Tian Y; Zhao C,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40290047/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40263878,Cyanidin-3-glucoside improves cognitive impairment in naturally aging mice by modulating the gut microbiota and activating the ERK/CREB/BDNF pathway.,"Aging-related cognitive impairment has emerged as a major health-threatening factor among the elderly, and cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) is a prominent anthocyanin with biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and alleviation of neurodegeneration. However, the role of C3G in alleviating natural aging-induced cognitive impairment and the underlying mechanisms thereof remain unclear. In this study, experimental methods mainly included biochemical analysis, pathological analysis, immunofluorescence staining, transmission electron microscopy analysis, western blot, as well as the determination of the gut microbiota composition and detection of metabolites. We found that C3G may exert neuroprotective effects and promote brain health by alleviating brain atrophy and neuroinflammation, enhancing brain antioxidant capacity, regulating neurotransmitter expression and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, and attenuating blood-brain barrier and hippocampal synaptic damage. Furthermore, C3G also promotes gut health by decreasing inflammatory responses and intestinal tissue crypt damage, upregulating the expression of tight junction proteins, and attenuating intestinal damage. Notably, C3G regulated the microbiota composition in different intestinal segments and intestinal mucosa, as well as the metabolic homeostasis of gut microbiota metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), amino acids, and bile acids. Substantially increased levels of SCFAs could activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathway by acting on the G protein-coupled receptors. Correlation analysis indicated that increased gut microbiota, such as Faecalibaculum and Bifidobacterium, and elevated SCFAs were positively correlated with behavioral improvement and brain health. In conclusion, our findings reveal that C3G has the potential to improve natural aging-induced cognitive impairment by modulating the gut microbiota and its metabolite SCFAs, thereby activating the ERK/CREB/BDNF pathway.",Chen Y; Qi W; Peng W; Fang W; Song G; Hao Y; Wang Y,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40263878/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40263059,A smart capsule with a bacteria- and pH-triggered enteric polymer coating for targeted colonic microbiome sampling.,"The gut microbiome is recognized as a critical factor in advancing precision nutrition and medicine for health and in developing dietary recommendations and targeted therapies for gastrointestinal (GI) health and diseases. However, conventional sampling methods, such as fecal analysis and colonoscopy, often fail to capture microbial information from specific regions of the GI tract or require invasive procedures, thereby limiting accuracy and clinical utility. As a non-invasive alternative, passive sampling capsules have been developed for site-specific microbiome analysis by employing pH-sensitive enteric coatings that delay sampling until the capsule reaches the targeted intestinal region. Although this approach has been successful in the small intestine, colonic sampling remains challenging due to the high interpersonal variability in intestinal pH, which makes it difficult to rely solely on a pH-triggering mechanism. To overcome this challenge, a dual bacterially and pH triggered polymeric enteric coating was created by blending lactulose and N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, enabling complete dissolution within the colonic region. Through systematic characterization of multiple polymer blend compositions using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Thermogravimetric Analysis, and Differential Scanning Calorimetry, an optimized design was identified that provides both suitable physical integrity and rapid (∼2 h) degradation in the presence of colonic bacteria, across a pH range of 5 to 8. The optimized blend was subsequently applied as a double-layer enteric coating on a sampling capsule, enabling the dissolution of the outer layer in the small intestine and complete dissolution of the inner layer in the colon. In-vitro and in-vivo pig model studies were conducted to validate the capsule's sampling performance and to ensure the preservation of the microbial environment. Furthermore, 16S rRNA sequencing revealed a taxonomic similarity between samples collected by the capsule and the colonic microbiome (residing between the ileum and fecal matter). Overall, this technology provides an effective approach to targeted microbial sampling and may pave the way for more comprehensive colonic microbiome analyses and improved diagnostic capabilities for GI diseases. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Precise monitoring of the gut microbiome is vital for understanding health and disease, yet current sampling techniques often lack precision or require invasive procedures. Our work introduces a novel, non-invasive capsule that targets the colon using a dual-trigger polymer system activated by both pH and colonic bacteria. This design enables localized sampling of gut microbiota, overcoming the limitations of fecal analysis, endoscopy, and earlier pH-triggered capsule designs. By capturing microbial communities directly from the colon, our technology provides deeper insights into colonic health and conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer. This breakthrough represents a significant advancement in precision nutrition and medicine for human health, and advanced diagnostics and targeted therapies to support dietary guidance, clinical practice and biomedical research.",Sarnaik D; Krishnakumar A; Nejati S; Sullivan CR; Cross TL; Campbell WW; Johnson JS; Rahimi R,Acta biomaterialia,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40263059/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40253172,Hypoglycemic effect of dietary fibers from Moringa oleifera leaves: In vitro and in vivo studies.,"Moringa leaf is traditionally regarded as a natural antagonistic diabetic herb in many countries. This study aimed to investigate the potential hypoglycemic activity of Moringa dietary fibers (MDFs) with different particle sizes in vitro and in vivo and reveal the related mechanisms. Among MDFs, MDF200 exhibited the highest glucose adsorption and diffusion retarding capacities and the most effective inhibition of digestive enzyme activities in vitro. All MDF interventions ameliorated insulin resistance and tissue damage, alleviated oxidative stress and dyslipidemia in high-fat diet and streptozotocin induced type 2 diabetes mice in vivo. MDF interventions, especially MDF80 and MDF200, remarkably promoted the diversity of cecum flora and the abundance of beneficial intestinal bacteria (Ileibacterium, Bifidobacterium), while inhibited the harmful bacteria (Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1). The ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes was significantly reduced by MDF40 and MDF80 interventions. MDF80 promoted fecal acetic acid, butyric acid and total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), while MDF40 promoted fecal propionic acid. All MDF interventions remarkably promoted the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and stimulated higher G protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43) protein expression in liver. Larger MDF activated phosphorylation of AMPK and Erk, while smaller MDF stimulated GLP-1, more PI3K and phosphorylation of Akt protein expression. These results revealed that MDFs ameliorated T2DM through modulating microbiota-SCFAs receptor (GPR43)/AMPK signaling pathways and stimulating GLP-1 secretion and activated liver PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. This study offers an effective case for MDFs as a potential dietary intervention or adjuvant treatment for type 2 diabetes and the application of Moringa leaf as a functional food material.",Li X; Yong J; Zhao B; Zhu Y; Luo J; Sheng J; Tian Y,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40253172/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40169552,Lysine-arginine imbalance overcomes therapeutic tolerance governed by the transcription factor E3-lysosome axis in glioblastoma.,"Recent advances in cancer therapy have underscored the importance of targeting specific metabolic pathways. In this study, we propose a precision nutrition approach aimed at lysosomal function in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Using patient-derived GBM cells, we identify lysosomal activity as a unique metabolic biomarker of tumorigenesis, controlling the efficacy of temozolomide (TMZ), a standard GBM therapy. Employing combined analyses of clinical patient samples and xenograft models, we further elucidate the pivotal role of Transcription Factor Binding To IGHM Enhancer 3 (TFE3), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, in modulating malignant properties, particularly TMZ tolerance, by regulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α)-mediated mitochondrial activity. Notably, we find that lysine protects GBM cells from lysosomal stress by counteracting arginine's effects on nitric oxide production. The lysine restriction mimetic, homoarginine administration, significantly enhances the efficacy of anticancer therapies through lysosomal dysfunction. This study underscores the critical role of lysosomal function modulated by amino acid metabolism in GBM pathogenesis and treatment.",Jing Y; Kobayashi M; Shoulkamy MI; Zhou M; Thi Vu H; Arakawa H; Sabit H; Iwabuchi S; Quang Vu C; Kasahara A; Ueno M; Tadokoro Y; Kurayoshi K; Chen X; Yan Y; Arai S; Hashimoto S; Soga T; Todo T; Nakada M; Hirao A,Nature communications,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40169552/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40165714,Synbiotic combination of 2'-fucosyllactose and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> mitigates neurodevelopmental disorders and ASD-like behaviors induced by valproic acid.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by social deficits and repetitive behaviors. Increasing evidence suggests that the gut microbiota influences neurodevelopment and behavior. In this study, we established an ASD model by administering valproic acid (VPA) to pregnant females, with male offspring receiving a daily synbiotic intervention for four weeks post-weaning. The results indicate that the synbiotic combination of 2'-Fucosyllactose (2'-FL) and <i>Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12</i> (<i>BB-12</i>) outperformed that of 2'-FL and <i>Lactobacillus paracasei L9300BH</i> (<i>L9300BH</i>) in alleviating social deficits, repetitive behaviors, neuronal damage, and dysregulated expression of social-related genes and neuroinflammatory markers in ASD mice. Additionally, the intervention with 2'-FL and <i>BB-12</i> improved gut morphology and barrier integrity, reduced gut inflammation, and optimized the gut microbiota structure by increasing the abundance of <i>Bifidobacteria</i> and <i>Akkermansia</i>, known producers of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Notably, levels of acetate, propionate, and butyrate were significantly elevated in fecal samples. In summary, the synbiotic combination of 2'-FL and <i>BB-12</i> supports gut microbiota homeostasis, enhances fecal SCFA levels, and mitigates neurodevelopmental abnormalities in ASD mice.",He Y; Zhang B; Xin Y; Wang W; Wang X; Liu Z; She Y; Guo R; Jia G; Wu S; Liu Z,Food & function,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40165714/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40129020,"Effects of 1,3-Dioleoyl-2-palmitoylglycerol on Intestine Structural and Functional Development in Early Life.","1,3-Dioleoyl-2-palmitoyl-glycerol (OPO) is a specific triglyceride in human breast milk, and it has been added to infant formula to mimic human breast milk fat. Existing studies only focused on its effects on fatty acid and calcium absorption, as well as the intestinal microbial composition; however, effects of OPO on the early-life development of intestine were still unclear. Our study explored the effects of OPO on intestinal epithelial structure and barrier construction in neonatal mice and the involvement of intestinal microorganisms. OPO supplementation significantly increased the number of intestinal stem cells, which in turn promoted villus and crypt, and promoted goblet cell and Paneth cell differentiation. OPO also promotes epithelial barrier integrity by increasing the expression of mucin 2, lysozyme 1, and tight junction proteins. Furthermore, the benefits of OPO were associated with the higher abundance of beneficial bacteria (unclassified_f_Muribaculaceae, Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium, and Blautia) and elevated butyrate levels. This study demonstrates the efficacy of OPO on intestinal health in neonatal mice beyond defecation, expands the understanding of the biological functions of OPO, and expands its application in intestinal health products targeting special populations, such as the elderly or individuals with intestinal fragility or injury.",Wu F; Liu Y; Zhang M; Yuan X; Jin Y; Li Y; Wang R; Hao Y; Fang B,Molecular nutrition & food research,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40129020/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40120833,L-tyrosine alleviates autism-like behavior in mice by remodeling the gut microbiota.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impaired social interaction and repetitive stereotyped behavior, and effective interventions for the core autistic symptoms are currently limited. This study examines the protective role of L-tyrosine in alleviating ASD-like behavioral disorders in a valproic acid (VPA)-induced ASD mouse model and explores the underlying mechanisms via integrated multi-omics. We first investigated the potential of dietary L-tyrosine in mitigating autistic behavior. Subsequently, 16S rRNA sequencing, hippocampal transcriptomics, and neurotransmitter metabolome were employed to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Further, we conducted transplantation of the L-tyrosine-regulated microbiota in VPA-induced ASD mice. The results showed that L-tyrosine supplementation significantly mitigates ASD-like behavioral disorders, alleviates social communication deficits, and reduces repetitive behavior in autistic mice. L-tyrosine also attenuates the neuronal loss caused by VPA treatment in the DG and CA1 hippocampal regions in mice. The hippocampi of the L-tyrosine-treated mouse model for ASD displays modified gene expression profiles and different neurotransmitter levels. L-tyrosine also mitigates colonic barrier damage and amends the gut microbial composition and function. The integrative transcriptomic, metabolomic, and microbiome analysis shows strong connections between the hippocampal genes, neurotransmitters, and gut microbiota affected by L-tyrosine. The transplantation of microbiota from L-tyrosine-treated mice to VPA-induced ASD mice recipients recapitulated the preventive and protective effects of L-tyrosine on autistic behavior disorders. These findings suggest that dietary L-tyrosine may represent a viable, effective treatment option for managing the physiological and behavioral deficits associated with ASD.",Fang J; Guo J; Lao Y; Kang SG; Huang K; Tong T,"Brain, behavior, and immunity",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40120833/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40108561,Gut microbiota signatures in food allergy children without and with malnutrition: a cross-sectional study.,"Altered gut microbiota (GM) profiles have been documented in children with food allergies (FA) and experiencing malnutrition. This study explored the GM composition in children with FA across varying degrees of malnutrition including those without malnutrition and those with different severity levels. Fresh faecal samples were collected from 120 children aged 1-6 years, including 40 FA children with adequate weight (FANM), 40 FA children with malnutrition (FAM), and 40 healthy controls. The hypervariable region of the 16 S rDNA gene was subsequently sequenced to assess bacterial communities. Compared with healthy controls, the FANM group displayed a greater increase in the alpha diversity index. The FAM group exhibited an increase in seven genera, including Alistipes and Parabacteroides, compared to the control group, whereas nine genera were enriched in the FANM group. An analysis of clinical characteristics revealed a positive correlation between the relative abundance of the genus Faecalibacterium and the total IgE level. Fourteen pivotal microbial markers demonstrated substantial classification potential (AUC: 89.86%, 95% CI: 76.40-99.73% for FAM; AUC: 88.92%, 95% CI: 73.58-99.65% for FANM).

Complete genome analysis is crucial for the functional exploration of probiotics. This study aimed to investigate the potential of L. rhamnosus OF44 (OF44) to promote human health through complete genome and phenotypic analysis. The complete genome sequence of OF44 was 2,978,769 bp, with 2791 CDSs and an average GC content of 47%. In vitro experiments demonstrated that OF44 had a broad carbon source fermentation capacity. Resistance gene analysis and simulated digestion tests confirmed the favorable tolerance of OF44 under harsh conditions, suggesting its potential as an oral supplement. OF44 possessed various potential genes related to bioactive substances with antimicrobial activity, such as antimicrobial peptides, lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and exopolysaccharides, most of which were detected in vitro. Further, OF44 exhibited significant growth inhibition capacities against pathogens from the gut, vagina, skin, and mouth, likely due to high co-aggregation with pathogens, multiple antimicrobial peptide clusters, and adhesin gene clusters. Additionally, oral administration of OF44 was found to reduce the pH and inflammation levels in the vaginal microenvironment of rats with bacterial vaginosis. Therefore, OF44 exhibited probiotic properties in improving reproductive tract bacterial infections by modulating vaginal microbiota balance and inhibiting pathogen growth. In summary, this study provided a new perspective on the application of OF44 as a supplement in the food and pharmaceutical fields.",Wang J; Ma Z; Xu Q; Wei B; Wang M; Liu Y; Tian Y; Zhang H; Xiao L; Zhong Y; Zou Y,Probiotics and antimicrobial proteins,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40106191/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40076704,"Rotenone Induces Parkinsonism with Constipation Symptoms in Mice by Disrupting the Gut Microecosystem, Inhibiting the PI3K-AKT Signaling Pathway and Gastrointestinal Motility.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Constipation is a prodromal symptom of PD. It is important to investigate the pathogenesis of constipation symptoms in PD. Rotenone has been successfully used to establish PD animal models. However, the specific mechanism of rotenone-induced constipation symptoms is not well understood. In this work, we found that constipation symptoms appeared earlier than motor impairment in mice gavaged with a low dose of rotenone (30 mg/kg·BW). Rotenone not only caused loss of dopaminergic neurons and accumulation of α-synuclein, but also significantly reduced serum 5-HT levels and <i>5-HTR4</i> in the striatum and colon. The mRNA expression of aquaporins, gastrointestinal motility factors (<i>c-Kit</i>, <i>Cx43</i>, <i>smMLCK</i> and <i>MLC-3</i>) in mouse colon was also significantly regulated by rotenone. In addition, both colon and brain showed rotenone-induced inflammation and barrier dysfunction; the PI3K/AKT pathway in the substantia nigra and colon was also significantly inhibited by rotenone. Importantly, the structure, composition and function of the gut microbiota were also significantly altered by rotenone. Some specific taxa were closely associated with motor and constipation symptoms, inflammation, and gut and brain barrier status in PD mice. <i>Akkermansia</i>, <i>Staphylococcus</i> and <i>Lachnospiraceae_UCG</i>-<i>006</i> may play a role in exacerbating constipation symptoms, whereas <i>Acinetobacter</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Solibacillus</i> and <i>Eubacterium_xylanophilum</i>_groups may be beneficial in stimulating gastrointestinal peristalsis, maintaining motor function and alleviating inflammation and barrier damage in mice.

40068742,Curcumin-loaded Pickering emulsions stabilized by Spanish mackerel protein-pectin for ameliorating ulcerative colitis through barrier repair and anti-inflammatory effects.,"Curcumin (Cur) has gained considerable recognition because of its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects as a bioactive compound, but its water insolubility and low bioaccessibility limit its application in food industry. In this study, Pickering emulsion stabilized by Spanish mackerel protein and pectin complex (SMP/PEC) was prepared to deliver curcumin, and its alleviating effects on DSS-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) were investigated. The emulsions stabilized by SMP/PEC 1:1 inhibited phase separation, had good rheological properties and the emulsions were stable at high temperatures, centrifugation, salt ions, and pH conditions. Meanwhile, the bioaccessibility of Cur loaded in the emulsion was 2.6 times higher than that of free Cur in corn oil. Furthermore, in vivo experiments have demonstrated that Cur loaded Pickering emulsion stabilized by SMP/PEC could enhance the proliferation of goblet cells and the expression of tight junction proteins, and restore the structural integrity of colonic tissues. Additionally, it has been shown to downregulate pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as serum IL-6 and TNF-α, and reduce the levels of MPO, NO, and other biomarkers in colonic tissues. Concurrently, gut microbiota demonstrated that emulsion stabilized by SMP/PEC could regulate the relative abundance of intestinal microorganisms, facilitating the increase of beneficial bacteria and reducing the level of harmful bacteria in the gut. In conclusion, the findings of this study indicated that SPECPE might be a potentially beneficial dietary supplement for the prevention of ulcerative colitis.",Sun Y; Liang J; Ma J; Su W; Cheng S,International journal of biological macromolecules,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40068742/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40004140,Correlations Between Amelioration of Rotenone-Induced Parkinson's Symptoms by <i>Amomum tsaoko</i> Flavonoids and Gut Microbiota in Mice.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, but the existing therapeutic drugs for PD have limitations; thus, there is an urgent need to discover new methods of prevention and treatment. <i>Amomum tsaoko</i> Crevost et Lemarie (AT) is a classic traditional Chinese medicine and food. Its main pharmacological effect is the regulation of the gastrointestinal tract. To date, no studies on the use of AT or its extracts to treat PD have been reported. In this study, a rotenone-induced PD mouse model was utilized to evaluate the protective effect of <i>Amomum tsaoko</i> flavonoids (ATFs) and to elucidate the role of the gut microbiota in this effect. The results demonstrated that ATFs not only ameliorated the motor and constipation symptoms but also reduced the loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, ATFs reduced the expression of inflammation-related genes (<i>TNF-α</i>, <i>IL-1β</i>, <i>IL-6</i>, <i>COX-2</i>, and <i>MCP-1</i>) and increased the expression of gut barrier-related genes (<i>Muc-2</i>, <i>ZO-1</i>, <i>Occludin</i>, <i>Claudin3</i>, and <i>Claudin4</i>) in the colon. Notably, ATFs were able to reverse rotenone-induced gut dysbiosis, including a significant decrease in the abundance of conditionally pathogenic bacteria (<i>Desulfovibrio</i>, <i>Provotellaceae UCG-001</i>, the <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>_<i>NK4A136_group</i>, <i>norank_f_Erysipelotrichacea</i>, and the <i>Eubacterium nodatum group</i>) and an increase in the abundance of probiotics (<i>Bifidobacterium</i> and <i>Faecalibaculum</i>). Interestingly, these genera were found to be significantly associated with PD motor symptoms and constipation indicators. This suggests that ATFs have the potential to alleviate PD symptoms through the modulation of gut microbes.

While probiotics show promise in managing diseases through microbiome modulation, their therapeutic impact on gut dysfunction-induced bone and muscle loss remains to be elucidated. Employing dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced gut dysfunction model and wide-spectrum antibiotics (ABX)-treated mice model, our study revealed that gut dysfunction instigates muscle and bone loss, accompanied by microbial imbalances. Importantly, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis A6 (B. lactis A6) administration significantly ameliorated muscle and bone loss by modulating gut microbiota composition and enhancing butyrate-producing bacteria. This intervention effectively restored depleted butyrate levels in serum, muscle, and bone tissues caused by gut dysfunction. Furthermore, butyrate supplementation mitigated musculoskeletal loss by repairing the damaged intestinal barrier and enriching beneficial butyrate-producing bacteria. Importantly, butyrate inhibited the NF-κB pathway activation, and reduced the secretion of corresponding inflammatory factors in T cells. Our study highlights the critical role of dysbiosis in gut dysfunction-induced musculoskeletal loss and underscores the therapeutic potential of B. lactis A6. These discoveries offer new microbiome directions for translational and clinical research, providing promising strategies for preventing and managing musculoskeletal diseases.",Chen M; Li Y; Zhai Z; Wang H; Lin Y; Chang F; Ge S; Sun X; Wei W; Wang D; Zhang M; Chen R; Yu H; Feng T; Huang X; Cheng D; Liu J; Di W; Hao Y; Yin P; Tang P,Bone research,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40000617/,0,0,0,0,0,0

High levels of heavy metal iron (Fe) are potentially toxic and readily accumulate in organisms, causing damage. Up to now, there are few studies about the toxicity of Fe in the water on shrimp. In this study, the acute toxic effects of different concentrations of combined FeSO<sub>4</sub> and FeCl<sub>3</sub> on Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) were examined from the aspects of survival, metal bioaccumulation, oxidative stress, and changes in intestinal microbes. The median lethal concentration (LC<sub>50</sub>) of Fe at 96 h was 5.484 mg/L assessed after 0 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h at nominal concentrations of 0.2, 1.0, 5.0, 25.0, 125.0 and 625.0 mg/L for Fe respectively. No deaths were reported in the control group, but a significant rise in mortality was observed as the concentration of Fe increased every 24 h. A higher concentration of Fe exposure (1 % 96h- LC<sub>50</sub>, 0.05484 mg/L; 10 % 96h-LC<sub>50</sub>, 0.5484 mg/L) resulted in a significant rise of Fe concentration in the muscle tissue by 16.94 and 16.89 folds. Fe exposure significantly reduced superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities and elevated malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. The acute exposure to Fe altered the intestinal flora of L. vannamei, including several beneficial bacteria such as Acidimicrobiia and Clostridia, and they were presently lower in the Fe2 group compared to the control group. The findings suggested that exposure to Fe causes noticeable Fe bioaccumulation, oxidative stress, and disruption of intestinal microbiota in L. vannamei.",Asare D; Li G; Zheng Y; Tan B; Zhang S; Yohana MA; Boateng AG; Bissih F,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39986057/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39976439,Puerarin combined with <i>Hericium erinaceus</i> insoluble dietary fiber alleviates obesity induced by high-fat diet through regulating the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway influenced by gut microbiota.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the combined effects of puerarin (Pue) and insoluble dietary fiber from <i>Hericium erinaceus</i> (HEIDF) on obesity induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) in mice, focusing on their effects on lipid and glucose metabolism, gut microbiota (GM), and serum metabolites. Glucose tolerance, tissue pathology, and serum biochemical levels were conducted to assess the effects of puerarin combined with <i>Hericium Erinaceus</i> insoluble dietary fiber (LH) on glucose and lipid metabolism. 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabonomics were employed to explore the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that the LH group significantly reduced body weight and hepatic and adipose lipid accumulation, and improved glucose tolerance and dyslipidemia compared to the Pue or HEIDF groups alone. Moreover, the LH group exhibited enhanced regulation of GM, including increased microbial diversity, higher abundance of beneficial bacteria such as g__Lactobacillus and g__Bacillus, and a decreased Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidota ratio. In addition, the LH group ameliorated HFD-induced serum metabolite changes and promoted the activation of tryptophan and glycerophospholipid metabolism pathways. The combination of Pue and HEIDF exhibits a synergistic anti-obesity effect by modulating specific GM (g__Lactobacillus and g__Bacillus) and serum metabolites.IMPORTANCEThe combination of HEIDF and Pue holds significant importance in the context of obesity. This synergistic effect not only aids in weight management but may also enhance metabolic health through various mechanisms, including increased satiety and promotion of fat oxidation. Therefore, incorporating these two components into the daily diet could offer effective strategies for the prevention and intervention of obesity and its related diseases.",Wang G; Wang B; Zhou Q; Cheng Z; Liu L; Zhang S; Zhou S; Luo P,Applied and environmental microbiology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39976439/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39961375,"Evaluation of the safety and probiotic properties of Limosilactobacillus fermentum BGI-AF16, a uric acid-lowering probiotic strain.","Some beneficial microorganisms in the intestine have the potential to degrade uric acid, offering a novel strategy for the prevention of hyperuricemia. In this study, the safety and probiotic potentials of Limosilactobacillus fermentum BGI-AF16 were evaluated by whole genome sequence analysis and in vitro experiments. Based on the gene analysis of antibiotic resistance and virulence factors, L. fermentum BGI-AF16 has been shown to be safe. We identified probiotic-related genes by genome annotation tools and conducted in vitro experiments to evaluate the ability of L. fermentum BGI-AF16 to inhibit pathogenic bacteria, tolerate a simulated gastrointestinal environment, and degrade uric acid. The results from in vitro experiments showed that L. fermentum BGI-AF16 had inhibitory effects on four clinically relevant pathogens and was highly tolerant to the gastrointestinal environment. In addition, L. fermentum BGI-AF16 was able to rapidly degrade uric acid within the first hour, and the strain could degrade 56.36 ± 2.32 % of uric acid by the third hour. The genome of the strain contains genes encoding flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent urate hydroxylase (EC.1.14.13.113), an enzyme that directly metabolizes uric acid. And the strain has a complete uric acid metabolic pathway. These results suggest that L. fermentum BGI-AF16 is a probiotic candidate with significant potential for reducing uric acid level.",Hou X; Wang M; Hu T; Wu Z; Liang H; Zhong Y; Ma Z; Zhang H; Xiao L; Zhang W; Zou Y,Microbial pathogenesis,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39961375/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39861379,Integrating 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing and Metabolomics Analysis to Reveal the Mechanism of L-Proline in Preventing Autism-like Behavior in Mice.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impaired social interaction and repetitive stereotyped behavior. Effective interventions for the core autistic symptoms are currently limited. This study employed a valproic acid (VPA)-induced mouse model of ASD to assess the preventative effects of L-proline supplementation on ASD-like behaviors. The method of 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics analyses were conducted to investigate the modulation of gut microbiota and gut metabolites by L-proline. The results indicated that L-proline supplementation significantly prevented ASD-like behavioral disorders, including alleviating social communication deficits and reducing repetitive behavior in the ASD mice. The 16S rRNA sequencing analysis revealed that L-proline regulated the composition and structure of gut microbiota. L-Proline supplementation enhances the abundance of the <i>Verrucomicrobia</i> at the phylum level and the <i>Akkermansia</i> at the genus level, while concurrently reducing the abundance of the <i>Patescibacteria</i> at the phylum level, as well as the <i>Ileibacterium</i>, <i>Candidatus_Saccharimonas</i>, and <i>Lachnospiraceae_UCG-006</i> at the genus level in the VPA-induced mouse model for ASD. Additionally, the untargeted metabolomics results indicated that L-proline also modified the gut metabolite profiles. Functional analysis of the gut microbiota and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of differential metabolites between the L-proline-supplemented and VPA groups corroborated that L-proline decreased pathways related to nucleotide metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, and pyruvate metabolism, while increasing pathways involved in alpha-linolenic acid metabolism and phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis. The integrative metabolomic and microbiome analyses showed strong connections between the gut metabolites and gut microbiota affected by L-proline. These findings suggest that the modulatory effects of L-proline on gut microbiota and its metabolites may play a crucial role in preventing autism in mice. These findings suggest that dietary L-proline may represent a viable, effective option for preventing the physiological and behavioral deficits associated with ASD in mice.",Fang J; Kang SG; Huang K; Tong T,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39861379/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39849698,Long-term effects of Nε-carboxymethyllysine intake on intestinal barrier permeability: Associations with gut microbiota and bile acids.,"Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in processed foods are closely linked to intestinal injury. However, the long-term effects of exposure to free Nɛ-carboxymethyl lysine (CML), a prevalent AGE molecule, on intestinal barrier integrity have been rarely evaluated. This study investigated the temporal effects of CML exposure on intestinal barrier permeability in C57BL/6N mice at diet-related doses over 12, 14, and 16 weeks. No significant changes were observed at 12 weeks, but CML exposure significantly increased intestinal permeability at 14 and 16 weeks, accompanied by elevated serum LPS levels, colonic histological damage, and reduced tight junction protein expression at 16 weeks. CML exposure also altered gut microbiota composition and intestinal bile acid (BA) profiles, specifically reducing TDCA, GDCA, and GCDCA levels. Given the important role of colonic BA receptor signaling in maintaining the intestinal barrier integrity, the impact of CML on BA receptor signaling was assessed. CML exposure significantly downregulated BA receptor TGR5-YAP signaling in mice, while no significant effects were observed in vitro, suggesting that the changes observed in TGR5-YAP signaling in vivo may not result from the direct effects of CML. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed strong associations between altered gut microbiota, BA levels, TGR5-YAP signaling, and intestinal barrier injury. This study highlighted the chronic health risks of long-term CML intake and provided new insights into the links between CML-induced intestinal toxicity, gut microbiota, BA profiles, and BA receptor signaling.",Qiang X; Wang X; Liang S; Li S; Lv Y; Zhan J,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39849698/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39827177,Predicting metabolite response to dietary intervention using deep learning.,"Due to highly personalized biological and lifestyle characteristics, different individuals may have different metabolite responses to specific foods and nutrients. In particular, the gut microbiota, a collection of trillions of microorganisms living in the gastrointestinal tract, is highly personalized and plays a key role in the metabolite responses to foods and nutrients. Accurately predicting metabolite responses to dietary interventions based on individuals' gut microbial compositions holds great promise for precision nutrition. Existing prediction methods are typically limited to traditional machine learning models. Deep learning methods dedicated to such tasks are still lacking. Here we develop a method McMLP (Metabolite response predictor using coupled Multilayer Perceptrons) to fill in this gap. We provide clear evidence that McMLP outperforms existing methods on both synthetic data generated by the microbial consumer-resource model and real data obtained from six dietary intervention studies. Furthermore, we perform sensitivity analysis of McMLP to infer the tripartite food-microbe-metabolite interactions, which are then validated using the ground-truth (or literature evidence) for synthetic (or real) data, respectively. The presented tool has the potential to inform the design of microbiota-based personalized dietary strategies to achieve precision nutrition.",Wang T; Holscher HD; Maslov S; Hu FB; Weiss ST; Liu YY,Nature communications,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39827177/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39808876,Zearalenone exacerbates lipid metabolism disorders by promoting liver lipid droplet formation and disrupting gut microbiota.,"Zearalenone (ZEA), produced by Fusarium, is a fungal toxin commonly found in maize, wheat, and other cereals. ZEA has the ability to bind to estrogen receptors of humans and animals and is an environmental endocrine disruptor that may interfere with glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism. In this study, we first investigated the effects of chronic exposure to low doses of ZEA with a high-fat-diet (HFD) in obese C57BL/6 J mice. In the absence of significant toxicity and without affecting glucose tolerance, 50 and 100 μg/kg b. w. ZEA was found to significantly exacerbate lipid synthesis, accumulation and alter the overall transcriptional profile of the liver in mice synergistically with HFD. Validation in combination with AML-12 cells revealed that ZEA promoted lipid synthesis and increased hepatic lipid droplet accumulation via the HNF1β/PPARγ and SREBP1c-HSD17B13/PLINs signal pathways. Further, by analyzing the changes in the intestinal flora of mice and their relationship with lipid metabolism genes, it was found that ZEA decreased the relative abundance of Lactobacillus and increased the relative abundance of Ileococcus, E. faecalis, and Ricardia. These changes were significantly correlated with the expression of Pparg and Srebf1, etc. ZEA may contribute to the abnormality of lipid metabolism by influencing the intestinal microbiota. This study highlights the synergistic effects of long-term low-dose ZEA and excess lipids, providing a theoretical basis for elucidating the mechanism of chronic toxicity of ZEA and its negative impact on metabolic diseases.",Han X; Huangfu B; Xu T; Huang K; He X,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39808876/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39805824,High interindividual variability of indoxyl sulfate production identified by an oral tryptophan challenge test.,"Indoxyl sulfate (IS) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. IS is converted from indole, a metabolite of dietary tryptophan through the action of gut microbial tryptophanase, by two hepatic enzymes: CYP2E1 and SULT1A1. We hypothesized that the effect of tryptophan intake on IS production might differ from person to person. We enrolled 72 healthy persons (33 ± 7 years; 54.2% women) to undergo an oral tryptophan challenge test (OTCT), in which 7 blood samples were collected at 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h following oral administration of L-tryptophan 2000 mg. We observed high interindividual variability of IS production in the response to an OTCT. Twenty-four subjects in the lowest tertile of the baseline-adjusted area under the curve of IS were defined as low-IS producers, whereas 24 subjects in the highest tertile were defined as high-IS producers. There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics or CYP2E1 and SULT1A1-SNP genotyping distributions between the two IS-producing phenotypes. However, distinct differences in gut microbial composition were identified. In addition, the abundance of tryptophanase was significantly higher in the high-IS producers than in the low-IS producers (P = 0.01). The OTCT may serve as personalized dietary guidance. High-IS producers are more likely to be at greater risk of cardiovascular diseases and may benefit from consuming foods low in tryptophan. Potential clinical applications of the OTCT in precision nutrition warrant further investigation.",Lin TY; Wu WK; Hung SC,NPJ biofilms and microbiomes,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39805824/,0,0,0,0,0,0

This study comprehensively monitored changes in abiotic factors, microbial communities, and flavor profiles across two distinct fermentation processes in a <i>Baijiu</i> distillery, which differed significantly in their management of initial abiotic factors. Our results revealed significant differences in abiotic factors between the two groups, including moisture, ethanol, acidity, glucose, and organic acid levels. The assembly of microbial communities in fermented grains was primarily driven by deterministic processes. The moisture content in the fermented grains positively affected the growth and metabolism of core microbiota. The rapid proliferation and metabolism of core microbes led to a rapid increase in the acidity of the fermented grains, alongside a significant accumulation of ethyl lactate.

39779097,"Preparation, characterization, stability and replenishing calcium ability of Moringa oleifera leaf peptide-calcium chelates.","Calcium deficiency has garnered significant attention as a global public health issue. A new generation of calcium supplements, peptide-calcium chelates, is expected to increase in market value. In this study, we produced MORP (MW < 1 kDa) from Moringa oleifera leaf protein via enzymatic hydrolysis for chelation with Ca<sup>2+</sup> to produce MORP-Ca. SEM, EDS, FTIR and FS characterized the structure of MORP-Ca. The results indicate alterations in both the appearance and internal structure of MORP following calcium chelation. The functional groups of N-H, C-H, C-N, -C = O, -COO-, C-O, and -OH in MORP are involved in chelating Ca<sup>2+</sup> to form MORP-Ca. In addition, MORP-Ca exhibits poor stability in the stomach; however, it demonstrates high stability in the intestine and under various temperature conditions. The results of the cellular experiments demonstrated that MORP-Ca is an effective promoter of calcium transport and absorption. MORP-Ca effectively increased bone mineral density and improved bone formation in animal studies. In addition, MORP-Ca supplementation improved the gut microbiota imbalance in rats fed a calcium-deficient diet, resulting in an increase in Firmicutes and a decrease in Actinobacteria. Thus, there is a connection between altered gastrointestinal flora and calcium absorption. LC-MS/MS and molecular docking analyses identified ARNEGRDL, RELIIGDR, YTPDYETK, YYTPDYETK, and IKFEFPAVDTL as key peptide sequences for the calcium-supplementing role of MORP (MW < 1 kDa).

39722590,Gut microbes with the <i>gbu</i> genes determine TMAO production from L-carnitine intake and serve as a biomarker for precision nutrition.,"Gut microbial metabolism of L-carnitine, which leads to the production of detrimental trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), offers a plausible link between red meat consumption and cardiovascular risks. Several microbial genes, including <i>cntA/B</i>, the <i>cai</i> operon, and the recently identified <i>gbu</i> gene cluster, have been implicated in the conversion of dietary L-carnitine into TMA(O). However, the key microbial genes and associated gut microbes involved in this pathway have not been fully explored. Utilizing the oral carnitine challenge test (OCCT), which specifically measures TMAO production from L-carnitine intake and identifies TMAO producer phenotypes, we compared the abundance of microbial genes between low- and high-TMAO producers across three independent cohorts. Our findings consistently revealed that the <i>gbu</i> gene cluster, rather than <i>cntA/B</i> or the <i>cai</i> operon, was significantly enriched in high-TMAO producers. We further analyzed 292 paired multi-omic datasets from OCCT and shotgun metagenomic sequencing, which demonstrated a significant positive correlation between the abundance of fecal <i>gbu</i> genes and L-carnitine-induced TMAO production, with <i>gbuB</i> showing the strongest correlation. Interestingly, these fecal <i>gbu</i> genes were found to increase with L-carnitine supplementation and decrease with a plant-based diet. Notably, we verified a previously uncultured <i>gbu</i>-containing bacterium, JAGTTR01 sp018223385, as the major contributor to TMA formation in the human gut. We isolated these <i>gbu</i>-containing gut microbes and confirmed their role in TMA/TMAO production using anaerobic incubation and a gnotobiotic mouse model. Using an in-house collection of <i>gbu</i>-containing isolates, we developed a qPCR-based method to quantify fecal <i>gbuB</i> and validated its correlation with L-carnitine-mediated TMAO production as measured by OCCT. Overall, these findings suggest that <i>gbu</i>-containing gut microbes are crucial for TMAO increases following L-carnitine intake and may serve as biomarkers or targets for personalized nutrition.",Wu WK; Lo YL; Chiu JY; Hsu CL; Lo IH; Panyod S; Liao YC; Chiu THT; Yang YT; Kuo HC; Zou HB; Chen YH; Chuang HL; Yen JJY; Wang JT; Chiu HM; Hsu CC; Kuo CH; Sheen LY; Kao HL; Wu MS,Gut microbes,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39722590/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39684522,A Potential Use of Vidarabine: Alleviation of Functional Constipation Through Modulation of the Adenosine A2A Receptor-MLC Signaling Pathway and the Gut Microbiota.,"Vidarabine (VID) is an antiviral medication that is commonly utilized to treat conditions such as hand, foot, and mouth disease and herpes. Constipation is a prevalent complication of these diseases. Could VID treat these diseases by influencing defecation behavior? To date, no studies have been conducted on the potential of VID to relieve constipation. Therefore, a systematic investigation was conducted into the laxative effects and mechanisms of VID using loperamide-induced functional constipated mice. The findings indicate that the oral administration of VID promoted gastrointestinal peristalsis, improved fecal properties, facilitated defecation, and demonstrated a significant laxative effect on functional constipated mice. It has been demonstrated that VID may increase the water content of feces by regulating the expression of aquaporins (AQP3, AQP4, and <i>AQP8</i>) in the colon and promote intestinal motility by regulating the expression of neurotransmitters (AChE and VIP) and the adenosine A2A receptor-myosin light chain (A2AR-MLC) signaling pathway in constipated mice. Concurrently, VID may also reduce colonic inflammation in constipated mice, reinforce the gut barrier function, and alter the composition and structure of the gut microbial community. Some microbial taxa, including Firmicutes and <i>Lactobacillus</i>, were found to be associated with the alleviation of constipation, while other taxa, including Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Muribaculaceae, <i>Muribaculum</i>, <i>norank__f__Desulfovibrionaceae</i>, and <i>Parasutterella</i>, were found to be associated with constipation. These results indicate that the gut microbiota may play a significant role in the alleviation of constipation by VID. These findings confirm the efficacy of VID in a constipated animal model, which justifies further investigation into its potential clinical applications.",Gao X; Guo K; Liu S; Yang W; Sheng J; Tian Y; Peng L; Zhao Y,International journal of molecular sciences,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39684522/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Machine learning models highlighted specific microbial signatures for each sex, achieving high accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.91 for women and 0.72 for men). The key microbial taxa linked to MASLD included <i>Christensenella</i> and <i>Limosilactobacillus</i> in women and <i>Beduinibacterium</i> and <i>Anaerotruncus</i> in men. Functional profiling showed that MASLD patients had increased pathways for amine biosynthesis and amino acid degradation, while the controls exhibited enhanced fermentation pathways.

39683559,The Mediating Role of Body Mass Index in the Association Between Dietary Index for Gut Microbiota and Biological Age: A Study Based on NHANES 2007-2018.,"The dietary index for gut microbiota (DI-GM) is a newly proposed metric for assessing diet quality, and its relationship with biological age is unclear. We hypothesize that consuming foods conducive to a healthy gut microbiota environment may decelerate aging. This cross-sectional study utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) spanning the years 2007 to 2018. The DI-GM was calculated by averaging the intakes from two 24-h dietary recall interviews. The biological age indicators were assessed using the Klemera-Doubal Method (KDM), phenotypic age (PA), and homeostasis disorder (HD). Logistic regression, restricted cubic splines (RCS), and mediation analysis were employed to explore the association between DI-GM and KDM, PA, and HD. The study included 20,671 participants. According to the logistic regression model, adjusting for all covariates, a negative association was observed between the DI-GM score and biomarkers of biological aging. Compared to participants in the lowest quartile for DI-GM scores, those in the highest quartile exhibited reduced odds ratio (OR) for all of the biological age indicators, namely biological age assessed via KDM (OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.60-0.79), PA (OR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.73-0.97), and HD (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.76-0.98). Additionally, RCS analysis revealed a nonlinear association between DI-GM and biological age. Mediation analysis showed that the body mass index (BMI) partly mediated the association between DI-GM and biological age. Therefore, we concluded that a higher DI-GM score is associated with a lower risk of accelerated aging, with BMI mediating this association. Future research should validate these findings through the use of longitudinal studies.",An S; Qin J; Gong X; Li S; Ding H; Zhao X; He H; Zhou L; Deng X; Chu X,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39683559/,0,0,0,0,0,1

However, little relevant research on the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis has been performed. This study aimed to investigate the effects of MM and FM on the prevention of dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis in a mouse model and to preliminarily elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that MM and FM had different degrees of protective effects against the damage caused by DSS and alleviated ulcerative colitis by inhibiting weight loss, reducing colon length shortening, and restoring intestinal structure. Additionally, MM and FM maintained intestinal tight junction protein levels to repair barrier function, downregulated inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and iNOS) and bolstered the body's antioxidant defense system. Moreover, MM and FM regulated dysregulation of the intestinal microenvironment by improving the diversity of the gut microbiota and reshaping its structure, including increasing the proportion of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and the relative abundance of beneficial bacterial genera (e.g., Akkermansia). In summary, MM and FMM can serve as dietary resources for preventing ulcerative colitis and maintaining intestinal homeostasis.",Li Y; Yue X; Ren X; Pang Y; Wang T; Huangfu B; Mikhailovich ZA; Vasilievich KV; Zhang M; Luan Y; Wang Q; He X,Journal of dairy science,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39647629/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Here we aim to investigate diet-gut microbiome interaction at single-subject resolution and explore its effects on blood glucose homeostasis. We conducted a series of nutritional n-of-1 trials (NCT04125602), in which 30 participants were assigned high-carbohydrate (HC) and low-carbohydrate (LC) diets in a randomized sequence across 3 pair of cross-over periods lasting 72 days. We used shotgun metagenomic sequencing and continuous glucose monitoring systems to profile the gut microbiome and blood glucose, respectively. An independent cohort of 1219 participants with available metagenomics data are included as a validation cohort. We demonstrated that the gut microbiome exhibited both intra-individually dynamic and inter-individually personalized signatures during the interventions. At the single-subject resolution, we observed person-specific response patterns of gut microbiota to interventional diets. Furthermore, we discovered a personal gut microbial signature represented by a carb-sensitivity score, which was closely correlated with glycemic phenotypes during the HC intervention, but not LC intervention. We validate the role of this score in the validation cohort and find that it reflects host glycemic sensitivity to the personal gut microbiota profile when sensing the dietary carbohydrate inputs. Our finding suggests that the HC diet modulates gut microbiota in a person-specific manner and facilitates the connection between gut microbiota and glycemic sensitivity. This study represents a new paradigm for investigating the diet-microbiome interaction in the context of precision nutrition.

39589428,From Biofilm to Breath: The Role of <i>Lacticaseibacillus paracasei</i> ET-22 Postbiotics in Combating Oral Malodor.,"Previous studies demonstrated that sufferers with halitosis can be significantly improved with <i>Lacticaseibacillus paracasei</i> ET-22 (ET-22) postbiotics intervention. The objectives of this investigation were to identify the primary components responsible for inhibiting oral malodor. This study demonstrated that cell-free supernatants (CFSs) were more effective in inhibiting production of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs). Untargeted metabolomics identified CFSs as primarily consisting of organic acids, lipids, peptides, and nucleotides. Among the potential active components, phenyllactic acid (PLA) and peptide GP(Hyp)GAG significantly inhibited microbial-induced VSCs production, with VSC concentrations reduced by 42.7% and 44.6%, respectively. Given the correlation between biofilms and halitosis, microstructural changes in biofilms were examined. PLA suppressed the biomass of the biofilm by 41.7%, while the biofilm thickness was reduced from 202.3 to 70.0 μm. GP(Hyp)GAG intervention reduced the abundance of <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i> and <i>Streptococcus mutans</i> within the biofilm, and the expression of biofilm-forming genes <i>FadA</i> and <i>Gtfb</i> were also suppressed by 41.8% and 59.4%. Additionally, the VSC production capacities were reduced due to the decrease in VSC producing bacteria (<i>F. nucleatum</i>, <i>Prevotella intermedia</i>, and <i>Solobacterium moorei</i>) and down-regulation of <i>Cdl</i> and <i>Mgl</i> genes. Collectively, the current study proved that PLA and GP(Hyp)GAG may be the main contributors to halitosis inhibition by ET-22 postbiotics.",Liu Y; Fang B; Wuri G; Lan H; Wang R; Sun Y; Zhao W; Hung WL; Zhang M,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39589428/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Our findings revealed substantial shifts in microbial composition, including significant reductions in beneficial genera such as Akkermansia and Ruminococcaceae and marked increases in pathogenic staphylococci, which correlated with elevated levels of toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) in serum and uterine tissue. RNA sequencing of uterine samples indicated activation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) pathway, along with significant upregulation of MMP-2 and TIMP-2, enzymes associated with ECM remodelling. Correlation analysis showed a strong link between staphylococcal proliferation and ECM pathway activation, suggesting that ZEA-induced gut dysbiosis contributes to uterine inflammation and structural alterations. These results reveal how ZEA disrupts gut and uterine health, highlighting critical pathways that could serve as targets for future preventive and therapeutic strategies against mycotoxin exposure.",Zhang R; Huangfu B; Xu T; Opatola VO; Ban Q; Huang K; He X,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39586525/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39579820,Water-insoluble dietary fiber from walnut relieves constipation through Limosilactobacillus reuteri-mediated serotonergic synapse and neuroactive ligand-receptor pathways.,"Dietary fiber can alleviate functional constipation (FC) by modulating the gut microbiota. To clarify the prebiotic properties of walnut insoluble dietary fiber (WIDF), we explored its structural characteristics and laxative mechanism. A galacturonic acid and glucose-rich WIDF was isolated from walnuts by using a complex enzymatic method. Animal experiments results showed that WIDF could effectively alleviate the symptoms of loperamide-induced FC in mice, including shortening the defecation time, increasing the wet weight and water content of feces, and promoting intestinal motility. WIDF might alleviate FC through activating serotonergic synapse and inhibiting the delta-opioid receptor/inducible nitric oxide synthase (Oprd/iNOS) pathways. Importantly, WIDF treatment altered the structure and composition of the gut microbiota. Correlation analysis revealed that Bacillus and its dominant ASV17, which is considered to be the key microbe for constipation alleviation, were strongly associated with constipation phenotypes. Based on pure culture and 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic analysis, Limosilactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri), which is 100 % similar to ASV17, was isolated and identified from the feces of WIDF-treated mice. L. reuteri relieved FC by modulating serotonergic synapse and the Oprd/iNOS pathways. These results suggested that WIDF and L. reuteri treatment is a prospective strategy for the prevention of constipation.",Yang W; Gao X; Lin J; Liu L; Peng L; Sheng J; Xu K; Tian Y,International journal of biological macromolecules,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39579820/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39564988,Tryptophan Metabolism-Regulating Probiotics Alleviate Hyperuricemia by Protecting the Gut Barrier Integrity and Enhancing Colonic Uric Acid Excretion.,"The balance of gut microbiota affects uric acid synthesis and excretion, influencing the development of hyperuricemia. This study aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of probiotics on hyperuricemia and adenine- and potassium oxonate-induced colonic damage. After two months of gavage at 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/day, the probiotic strains <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i> UA260 and <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> YU28, identified through <i>in vitro</i> screening, significantly reduced serum uric acid levels in hyperuricemia mice from 109.71 ± 56.33 to 38.76 ± 15.06 and 33.22 ± 6.91 μmol/L, respectively. These strains attenuated inflammatory, repaired gut barrier damage, and enhanced colonic uric acid transporter function, thereby promoting uric acid excretion. Furthermore, the probiotics significantly reshaped gut microbiota by increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria, including <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Coprococcus</i>, while modulating tryptophan, purine, and riboflavin metabolism. Changes in tryptophan metabolites, specifically indole-3-propionic acid and indole-3-acetic acid, were correlated with xanthine oxidase activity, colonic injury, and the expression of the uric acid transporter protein ABCG2 during treatment. Probiotics intervention activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor pathways. These findings suggest that probiotics alleviate hyperuricemia and colonic inflammatory by regulating gut microbiota composition and tryptophan microbial metabolite pathways. Probiotics that modulate tryptophan microbial metabolism may provide a potential strategy for treating or preventing hyperuricemia.",Wang Q; Liang J; Zou Q; Wang W; Yan G; Guo R; Yuan T; Wang Y; Liu X; Liu Z,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39564988/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39545611,Control of Starch Molecular Weight by Enzyme Treatment Facilitates the Formation of V-Type Starch-Resveratrol Complexes in a High-Pressure Homogenization Environment and Their Modulation Effects on the Gut Microbiota.,"As the concept of precision nutrition has been gradually popularized in recent years, the relationship between the structure of starch-polyphenol complexes with significant health effects and their nutritional functions has been progressively investigated. In this study, G50 high-amylose maize starch with different molecular weights was first prepared by pullulanase and α-amylase, and their effects on the structural formation, digestion properties, and release behaviors of the starch-resveratrol (RA) complex were discussed. The results confirmed that enzyme-treated starch could enhance intermolecular hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions between starch and RA in a high-pressure homogeneous (HPH) environment, forming stable single-helix and V-type crystalline structures while reducing the B-type crystalline structures. Meanwhile, the in vitro experiment showed that when the RA addition was 3%, the resistant starch content of the starch-RA complex could reach 60.3%, and its RA colonic transport rate could reach more than 97%. Interestingly, the starch-RA complex with a relatively higher V-type crystalline structure content contributed to the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), especially butyrate, and it might be effective in carbohydrate metabolism and immunometabolism by promoting the functions of <i>Phascolarctobacteriu</i> and <i>Alistipes</i>. These findings provide new ideas for the design of the nutritional functions of RS.",Zheng B; Li R; Chen L,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39545611/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39494312,"Effect of supplementation with lutein, zeaxanthin, and omega-3 fatty acids on macular pigment and visual function in young adults with long-term use of digital devices: study protocol for a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study.","Growing evidence emphasizes the importance of xanthophyll carotenoids and omega-3 fatty acids in eye health. However, the beneficial effects of such supplementation have not been thoroughly discussed among adults with high screen exposure. Current trial evidence on lutein bioavailability is contradictory, and the interactions of dietary intervention with host-related factors remain elusive. This study aims to investigate the comparative effectiveness of supplementation with macular xanthophylls and omega-3 fatty acids on macular pigment optical density (MPOD) and visual function, access the bioavailability of free lutein and lutein ester, and explore the complex interplay between genetic variations, intestinal microbiota, and the dietary intervention in Chinese adults with long-term exposure to digital devices. The Lutein, Zeaxanthin, and Omega-3 (LZO) clinical trial is a 24-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 600 participants recruited from research centers, universities, and communities. Individuals are eligible to participate if they are aged over 18 years and use digital devices for over 8 h daily in the last 2 years, and will be randomized to six arms. A total of three visits will be scheduled at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks. The primary outcome is the change in MPOD over the 24-week intervention. The secondary outcomes are changes in visual function (visual acuity, best-corrected visual acuity, contrast and glare sensitivity, critical flicker fusion, reaction time, visuognosis persistence, symptoms and signs of dry eye, retinal thickness, and optical quality), and changes in serum lutein and zeaxanthin concentrations, and erythrocyte membrane omega-3 fatty acids. Genetic variations will be determined using genome-wide genotyping at baseline. 16S rRNA gene sequencing will be utilized to assess microbiome compositional changes before and after intervention. The trial is anticipated to establish early interventions to prevent photochemical ocular damage and delay the onset of vision impairment in young adults with long-term repeated exposure to screen-based electronic devices, and provide valuable insights for the development of precision nutrition strategies for maintaining eye health. www.clinicaltrials.in.th, Identifier, TCTR20220904002.",Wang L; Ma M; Li Y; Pei C; Wang J; Li J; Yang L; Liu Q; Tang L; Hao Y; Jiang H; Fu J; Xiao Y; Wang Y; Cui M; Su T; Bai J; Tang H; Wang Y; Shan H; Jiang H; Deng C; Kong L; Hui Z; Ma L,Frontiers in nutrition,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39494312/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39468772,Comparative assessment of phenotypic markers in patients with chronic inflammation: Differences on Bifidobacterium concerning liver status.,"The relationship between systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and low-grade metabolic inflammation (MI) with the microbiota is crucial for understanding the pathogenesis of these diseases and developing effective therapeutic interventions. In this context, it has been observed that the gut microbiota plays a key role in the immune regulation and inflammation contributing to the exacerbation through inflammatory mediators. This research aimed to describe similarities/differences in anthropometric, biochemical, inflammatory, and hepatic markers as well as to examine the putative role of gut microbiota concerning two inflammatory conditions: SLE and MI. Data were obtained from a cohort comprising adults with SLE and MI. Faecal samples were determined by 16S technique. Statistical analyses compared anthropometric and clinical variables, and LEfSe and MetagenomeSeq were used for metagenomic data. An interaction analysis was fitted to investigate associations of microbiota with fatty liver index (FLI) depending on the inflammatory condition. Participants with low-grade MI showed worse values in anthropometry and biochemicals compared with patients with SLE. The liver profile of patients with MI was unhealthier, while no relevant differences were found in most of the inflammatory markers between groups. LEfSe analysis revealed an overrepresentation of Bifidobacteriaceae family in SLE group. An interactive association between gut Bifidobacterium abundance and type of disease was identified for FLI values, suggesting an effect modification of the gut microbiota concerning liver markers depending on the inflammatory condition. This study found phenotypical and microbial similarities and disparities between these two inflammatory conditions, evidenced in clinical and hepatic markers, and showed the interactive interplay between gut Bifidobacterium and liver health (measured by FLI) that occur in a different manner depending on the type of inflammatory disease. These results underscore the importance of personalized approaches and individual microbiota in the screening of different inflammatory situations, considering unique hepatic and microbiota profiles.",Chero-Sandoval L; Higuera-Gómez A; Martínez-Urbistondo M; Castejón R; Mellor-Pita S; Moreno-Torres V; de Luis D; Cuevas-Sierra A; Martínez JA,European journal of clinical investigation,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39468772/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39386242,Hybridization promotes growth performance by altering rumen microbiota and metabolites in sheep.,"Hybridization can substantially improve growth performance. This study used metagenomics and metabolome sequencing to examine whether the rumen microbiota and its metabolites contributed to this phenomenon. We selected 48 approximately 3 month-old male ♂Hu × ♀Hu (HH, <i>n</i> = 16), ♂Poll Dorset × ♀Hu (DH, <i>n</i> = 16), and ♂Southdown × ♀Hu (SH, <i>n</i> = 16) lambs having similar body weight. The sheep were fed individually under the same nutritional and management conditions for 95 days. After completion of the trial, seven sheep close to the average weight per group were slaughtered to collect rumen tissue and content samples to measure rumen epithelial parameters, fermentation patterns, microbiota, and metabolite profiles. The final body weight (FBW), average daily gain (ADG), and dry matter intake (DMI) values in the DH and SH groups were significantly higher and the feed-to-gain ratio (F/G) significantly lower than the value in the HH group; additionally, the papilla height in the DH group was higher than that in the HH group. Acetate, propionate, and total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations in the DH group were higher than those in the HH group, whereas NH<sub>3</sub>-N concentration decreased in the DH and SH groups. Metagenomic analysis revealed that several <i>Prevotella</i> and <i>Fibrobacter</i> species were significantly more abundant in the DH group, contributing to an increased ability to degrade dietary cellulose and enrich their functions in enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown. <i>Bacteroidaceae bacterium</i> was higher in the SH group, indicating a greater ability to digest dietary fiber. Metabolomic analysis revealed that the concentrations of rumen metabolites (mainly lysophosphatidylethanolamines [LPEs]) were higher in the DH group, and microbiome-related metabolite analysis indicated that <i>Treponema bryantii</i> and <i>Fibrobacter succinogenes</i> were positively correlated with the LPEs. Moreover, we found methionine sulfoxide and N-methyl-4-aminobutyric acid were characteristic metabolites in the DH and SH groups, respectively, and are related to oxidative stress, indicating that the environmental adaptability of crossbred sheep needs to be further improved. These findings substantially deepen the general understanding of how hybridization promotes growth performance from the perspective of rumen microbiota, this is vital for the cultivation of new species and the formulation of precision nutrition strategies for sheep.",Zhang R; Zhang L; An X; Li J; Niu C; Zhang J; Geng Z; Xu T; Yang B; Xu Z; Yue Y,Frontiers in veterinary science,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39386242/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39378659,"Intestinal-level anti-inflammatory bioactivities of whole wheat: Rationale, design, and methods of a randomized, controlled, crossover dietary trial in adults with prediabetes.","Randomized controlled trials (RCT) demonstrate that whole wheat consumption improves glycemia. However, substantial inter-individual variation is often observed, highlighting that dietary whole grain recommendations may not support the health of all persons. The objective of this report is to describe the rationale and design of a planned RCT aimed at establishing the gut microbiota and metabolome signatures that predict whole wheat-mediated improvements in glucose tolerance in adults with prediabetes. It is hypothesized that a controlled diet containing wheat bread (WHEAT; 160 g/day) compared with refined bread (WHITE) will improve glucose tolerance in a gut microbiota-mediated manner. Biospecimens will be collected before and after each 2-week study arm. Testing for oral glucose tolerance and gastrointestinal permeability will be performed post-intervention. Assessments will include oral glucose tolerance (primary outcome) and secondary outcomes including gut microbiota, targeted and untargeted metabolomics of fecal and plasma samples, intestinal and host inflammatory responses, and intestinal permeability. WHEAT is predicted to alleviate glucose intolerance by shifting microbiota composition to increase short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria while reducing populations implicated in intestinal inflammation, barrier dysfunction, and systemic endotoxemia. Further, benefits from WHEAT are anticipated to correlate with gut-level and systemic metabolomic responses that can help to explain the expected inter-individual variability in glucose tolerance. Thus, knowledge gained from integrating multi-omic responses associating with glucose tolerance could help to establish a precision nutrition-based framework that can alleviate cardiometabolic risk. This framework could inform novel dietary whole grain recommendations by enhancing our understanding of inter-individual responsiveness to whole grain consumption.",Cao S; Pierson JT; Bond AH; Zhang S; Gold A; Zhang H; Zamary KM; Moats P; Teegarden MD; Peterson DG; Mo X; Zhu J; Bruno RS,"Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39378659/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39377779,Robust prediction of colorectal cancer via gut microbiome 16S rRNA sequencing data.,"<b>Introduction.</b> The study addresses the challenge of utilizing human gut microbiome data for the early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC). The research emphasizes the potential of using machine learning techniques to analyze complex microbiome datasets, providing a non-invasive approach to identifying CRC-related microbial markers.<b>Hypothesis/Gap Statement.</b> The primary hypothesis is that a robust machine learning-based analysis of 16S rRNA microbiome data can identify specific microbial features that serve as effective biomarkers for CRC detection, overcoming the limitations of classical statistical models in high-dimensional settings.<b>Aim.</b> The primary objective of this study is to explore and validate the potential of the human microbiome, specifically in the colon, as a valuable source of biomarkers for colorectal cancer (CRC) detection and progression. The focus is on developing a classifier that effectively predicts the presence of CRC and normal samples based on the analysis of three previously published faecal 16S rRNA sequencing datasets.<b>Methodology.</b> To achieve the aim, various machine learning techniques are employed, including random forest (RF), recursive feature elimination (RFE) and a robust correlation-based technique known as the fuzzy forest (FF). The study utilizes these methods to analyse the three datasets, comparing their performance in predicting CRC and normal samples. The emphasis is on identifying the most relevant microbial features (taxa) associated with CRC development via partial dependence plots, i.e. a machine learning tool focused on explainability, visualizing how a feature influences the predicted outcome.<b>Results.</b> The analysis of the three faecal 16S rRNA sequencing datasets reveals the consistent and superior predictive performance of the FF compared to the RF and RFE. Notably, FF proves effective in addressing the correlation problem when assessing the importance of microbial taxa in explaining the development of CRC. The results highlight the potential of the human microbiome as a non-invasive means to detect CRC and underscore the significance of employing FF for improved predictive accuracy.<b>Conclusion.</b> In conclusion, this study underscores the limitations of classical statistical techniques in handling high-dimensional information such as human microbiome data. The research demonstrates the potential of the human microbiome, specifically in the colon, as a valuable source of biomarkers for CRC detection. Applying machine learning techniques, particularly the FF, is a promising approach for building a classifier to predict CRC and normal samples. The findings advocate for integrating FF to overcome the challenges associated with correlation when identifying crucial microbial features linked to CRC development.",Porreca A; Ibrahimi E; Maturo F; Marcos Zambrano LJ; Meto M; Lopes MB,Journal of medical microbiology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39377779/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39339465,Regulation of Cecal Microbiota and Improvement of Blood Lipids Using Walnut Non-Dairy Creamer in High-Fat Mice: Replacing Traditional Non-Dairy Creamer.,"Non-dairy creamer is a class of microencapsulated powdered fats and oils that are widely used in the food industry. However, the oils used in it are hydrogenated vegetable oils, which contain large amounts of saturated fatty acids and are extremely harmful to the human body. This study investigated the effects of replacing hydrogenated vegetable oil with walnut oil to prepare walnut non-dairy creamer on lipid levels and intestinal microorganisms in mice. The results show that low-dose walnut non-dairy creamer significantly decreased the contents of TC and TG in serum and increased the content of HDL-C (<i>p</i> < 0.01). The contents of MDA, ALT, and AST were significantly decreased, while the content of SOD was increased (<i>p</i> < 0.01). The abundance of <i>Firmicutes</i> in the walnut non-dairy creamer group decreased, and the abundance of <i>Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes</i> (B/F) increased, which significantly increased the richness of <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Oscillospira</i> (<i>p</i> < 0.01). <i>Allobaculum</i> richness was significantly decreased (<i>p</i> < 0.01). In conclusion, a low dose of walnut non-dairy creamer can effectively promote the metabolism of blood lipids in vivo, alleviate oxidative stress injury and lipid accumulation damage to mouse hepatocytes, and ameliorate the adverse effects of a high-fat diet on the intestinal microbiota of mice. This study provides a theoretical basis for the replacement of traditional non-dairy creamer and the research and development of walnut deep processing.",Wang M; Zhang F; Tan C; Huang S; Mu H; Wu K; Chen Y; Sheng J; Tian Y; Wang Y; Zhao C,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39339465/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Structural characterization revealed that TBs were polymeric phenolic compounds rich in hydroxyl and carboxyl groups. Nontargeted metabolomics revealed that amino acids were the primary nonvolatile metabolites in TBs-e and TBs-a, accounting for over 70 % of the total nonvolatile content. TBs-f contained more polyphenols, caffeine, and flavonoids, accounting for 14.2 %, 3.9 %, and 0.8 % of total nonvolatile content, respectively. In vivo, at 560 mg/kg body weight, TBs-f were associated with regulation of blood glucose and lipid concentrations in mice. Moreover, 16S rRNA indicated that at 1120 mg/kg body weight, TBs-a were associated with increased numbers of microbiota linked with hypolipidemic activity. This study explores the impacts of different preparation processes on TBs and provides a theoretical foundation for the understanding of TBs.",Zhang F; Wang Y; Wang M; Tan C; Huang S; Mou H; Wu K; Peng L; Fang Z; Tian Y; Sheng J; Zhao C,Food chemistry,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39332361/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39292180,Dietary eugenol ameliorates long-term high-fat diet-induced skeletal muscle atrophy: mechanistic insights from integrated multi-omics.,"Eugenol (EU), the major constituent of clove oil, possesses a range of bioactivities. Here, the therapeutic potential of oral EU for mitigating skeletal muscle wasting was investigated in a long-term high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice model. Male C57BL/6J mice, aged six weeks, were assigned to either a chow or a HFD for 10 weeks. Subsequently, the weight-matched HFD-fed mice were allocated into two groups, receiving either 0.2% (w/w) EU supplementation or no supplementation for 14 weeks. Our findings revealed that EU supplementation enhanced grip strength, increased hanging duration, and augmented skeletal muscle mass. RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that EU modified the gastrocnemius muscle transcriptomic profile, and the differentially expressed genes between HFD and EU groups were mainly involved in the HIF-1 signaling pathway, TCR signaling pathway, and cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, which is well-known to be related to skeletal muscle health. Untargeted metabolomics analysis further showed that EU supplementation significantly altered the nucleotide metabolism in the GAS muscle. Analysis of 16S rRNA sequencing demonstrated that EU supplementation ameliorated the gut dysbiosis caused by HFD. The alterations in gut microbiota induced by EU were significantly correlated with indexes related to skeletal muscle atrophy. The multi-omics analysis presented the robust interaction among the skeletal muscle transcriptome, metabolome, and gut microbiome altered by EU supplementation. Our results highlight the potential of EU in skeletal muscle atrophy intervention as a functional dietary supplement.",Li M; Guo J; Qin Y; Lao Y; Kang SG; Huang K; Tong T,Food & function,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39292180/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39277254,Effects of 1-oleate-2-palmitate-3-linoleate glycerol supplementation on the small intestinal development and gut microbial composition of neonatal mice.,"Recent studies have shown that 1-oleo-2-palmito-3-linoleyl glycerol (OPL) is the most abundant triacylglycerol in human breast milk in China. Epidemiologic studies have shown that sn-2 palmitate improves the absorption of fatty acids and calcium in infants. However, there have been few studies of the specific mechanism by which OPL affects intestinal function. In the present study, we have characterized the effects of various levels of OPL supplementation on the development of the intestinal epithelium and the intestinal microbiota of neonatal mice. OPL supplementation increased the body masses and intestinal lengths of weaned mice and promoted defecation. These positive effects were related to the effect of OPL to promote the development of intestinal villi and crypts. OPL increased the expression of the intestinal stem cell markers Olfm4 and Sox9 in the jejunum and ileum, which promoted their differentiation into goblet cells and Paneth cells. It also promoted the integrity of the epithelial barrier by increasing the secretion of mucin 2 and lysozyme 1 and the expression of the tight junction proteins occludin, ZO1, claudin 2, and claudin 3. More importantly, we found that low dose-OPL promotes the transformation of the intestinal microbiota of neonatal mice to the mature state in 3-month-old mice, increases the proportion of Firmicutes, and reduces the proportion of Bacteroidota. The proportions of anaerobic genera of bacteria, such as Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Lachnoclostridium, Ligilactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium were higher, as were the key producers of short-chain fatty acids, such as Bacteroides and Blautia. OPL also increased the butyric acid content of the feces, which significantly correlated with the abundance of Lactobacillus. High-dose OPL tended to be more effective at promoting defecation and the development of the villi and crypts, but these effects did not significantly differ from those achieved using the lower dose. A low dose of OPL was more effective at increasing the butyric acid content and causing the maturation of microbes. In summary, the OPL supplementation of newborn mice promotes the establishment of the intestinal epithelial layer structure and barrier function, and also promotes the transformation of the intestinal microbiota to a mature state. This study lays a theoretical foundation for the inclusion of OPL in infant formula and provides a scientific basis for the development of intestinal health products.",Wu F; Liu Y; Zhang M; Yuan X; Ji T; Jin Y; Li Y; Wang R; Hao Y; Fang B,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39277254/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39265770,Chronic UVB exposure induces hepatic injury in mice: Mechanistic insights from integrated multi-omics.,"Chronic UVB exposure poses a significant threat to both skin and visceral health. In recent years, the adverse role of chronic UVB exposure in liver health has been suggested but not fully elucidated. This study aims to comprehensively investigate the effects of chronic UVB exposure on liver health in male SKH-1 hairless mice and clarify potential mechanisms through multi-omics approaches. The findings suggested that 10-week chronic skin exposure to UVB not only triggers hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress but also, more importantly, results in lipid metabolism abnormalities in the liver. Hepatic transcriptomic analysis revealed significant alterations in various signaling pathways and physiological processes associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, and lipid metabolism. Further lipidomic analysis illustrated significant changes in the metabolism of glycerolipids, sphingolipids, and glycerophospholipids in the liver following chronic UVB exposure. The 16S rRNA sequencing analysis indicated that chronic UVB exposure disrupts the structure and function of the microbiota. In search of potential mechanisms used by the microbiome to regulate the hepatic disease morphology, we filtered mouse fecal supernatants and cultured the supernatants with HepG2 cells. Fecal supernatant from UVB-exposed mice induced increased secretion of the inflammatory cytokine IL-8, accumulation of MDA, reduced SOD activity, and decreased lipid content in normal hepatic cells. In summary, skin chronic exposure to UVB induces multiple liver injuries and gut microbiota dysbiosis in mice and gut microbiota metabolites may be one of the contributing factors to hepatic injury caused by chronic UVB exposure. These discoveries deepen the comprehension of the health risks associated with chronic UVB exposure.",Geng R; Guo J; Lao Y; Kang SG; Huang K; Tong T,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39265770/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39174126,The galactomannan-EGCG physical complex: Effect of branching degree and molecular weight on structural and physiological properties.,"Polysaccharides and polyphenols are bioactive components that co-exist in many plant foods. Their binary interaction in terms of the structure-function relationships, however, has not been well clarified. This study elucidated the correlation between the structural and physiological properties of galactomannan (GM) -catechin monomer complexes and GM with different branching or molecular weight (Mw). Results indicated that locus bean gum with lower branching degree (Gal/Man is 0.259) bound more readily to EGCG with adsorption rate of 19.42 %. EGCG and ECG containing galloyl groups were more inclined to form hydrogen bonds with GMs, significantly improving the adsorption by GMs. The introduction of EGCG could enhance the antioxidant activity and starch digestion inhibition of GM, which positively correlated with the adsorption capacity of EGCG. The guar gum (GG) with higher Mw (7384.3 kDa) could transport 71.51 % EGCG into the colon, while the retention rate of EGCG reaching the colon alone was only 46.33 %. Conversely, GM-EGCG complex with lower Mw (6.9 kDa) could be readily utilized by gut microbiota, and increased production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). This study elucidated the structure-properties relationship of GM-EGCG complexes, and provide a new idea for the development and precision nutrition of polysaccharides-polyphenol complexes fortified functional foods.",Wang W; Chang J; Zhang Z; Liu H; He L; Liu Y; Kang J; Goff HD; Li Z; Guo Q,Carbohydrate polymers,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39174126/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39147378,Physiological responses and microbiota shifts after spermidine administration as a postbiotic on rodents fed a high-fat high-fructose diet.,"The consumption of a high-fat high-fructose diet partly resemble the western dietary patterns, which is closely associated with excessive body adiposity and metabolic disorders, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Moreover, this unhealthy regime produces unfavourable changes on the faecal microbiota, potentially interfering with microorganisms postbiotic function, such as spermidine, a natural polyamine that has been involved in the control of weight gain. The study aimed to analyse the repercussions of spermidine supplementation on somatic measurements, metabolic markers, and the faecal microbiota profile of rats fed a diet rich in fat and fructose. Indeed, Wistar males with oral administration of spermidine (20 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks were evaluated for food and energy intake, biochemical markers, and faecal microbiota signatures. The daily use of spermidine decreased weight gain ( P < 0.01), reduced feed efficiency ( P < 0.01), and attenuated visceral fat deposition ( P < 0.01), although no effect on energy intake, hepatic weight, triglyceride and glucose index and atherogenic indexes. Similarly, the consumption of spermidine partially restored the presence of microbial species, notably Akkermansia muciniphila. Elevated concentrations of this species were linked to a decrease in triglycerides ( P = 0.04), indicating that the supplementation of spermidine might contribute to managing energy fuel homeostasis in association with an obesogenic diet.",Melo NCO; Cuevas-Sierra A; Casillas-Fikentscher A; Arellano-Garcia L; Portillo MP; Milton-Laskibar I; Martinez JA,Beneficial microbes,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39147378/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39061833,<i>Bifidobacterium lactis</i> and <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> Enhance Immune Function and Antioxidant Capacity in Cats through Modulation of the Gut Microbiota.,"Gastrointestinal (GI) afflictions are prevalent among the feline population, wherein the intricacies of the gut microbiome exert a profound influence on their overall health. Alterations within this microbial consortium can precipitate a cascade of physiological changes, notably in immune function and antioxidant capacity. This research investigated the impact of <i>Bifidobacterium lactis</i> (<i>B. lactis</i>) and <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> (<i>L. plantarum</i>) on cats' GI health, exploring the effects of probiotic supplementation on the intestinal ecosystem using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The findings demonstrated a significant improvement in gut barrier function by reducing plasma concentrations of D-lactate (D-LA) by 30.38% and diamine oxidase (DAO) by 22.68%, while increasing the population of beneficial bacteria such as <i>Lactobacillus</i>. There was a notable 25% increase in immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels, evidenced by increases of 19.13% in catalase (CAT), 23.94% in superoxide dismutase (SOD), and 21.81% in glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px).

39013293,"Temporal variation in production performance, biochemical and oxidative stress markers, and gut microbiota in Pekin ducks during the late growth stage.","In the late growth stage of commercial Pekin ducks, a significant increase in feed intake and a decline in body weight gain have been observed, leading to impaired feed conversion efficiency. To address this issue, we investigated alterations in production performance, blood biochemical indices, ileum tissue architecture, and microbial community structure in Pekin ducks. The primary objective was to provide robust data supporting the improvement of meat duck production efficiency during the late growth stage (28-42-days-old). Forty 28-day-old Pekin ducks were randomly assigned to 8 replicates, with five ducks per replicate. The rearing period lasted 14 days, with feed and water provided ad libitum. Our findings indicated a significant increase in Pekin duck body and heart weights with advancing age (P < 0.05). Moreover, serum antioxidant enzyme and high-density lipoprotein concentrations significantly increased, whereas triglyceride levels decreased (P < 0.05). Notably, the height of the ileal villi was significantly reduced (P < 0.05). The microbial community structure of the ileum exhibited significant changes as ducks aged, accompanied by a substantial increase in microbial flora diversity, particularly with the formation of more tightly connected microbial network modules. Time-dependent enrichment was observed in microbial gene functions related to energy metabolism pathways. At the genus level, Sphingomonas and Subdoligranulum have emerged as crucial players in microbial differential functional pathways and network formation. These bacteria likely serve as the key driving factors in the dynamic microbial changes that occur in Pekin ducks over time. Overall, our findings suggest a potential decline in the absorption function of the small intestine and fat deposition performance of Pekin ducks during later growth stages, which may be attributed to the maturation and proliferation of the gut microbial community.",Liu Y; Wang X; Zeng D; Wang H; Ma Y; Zhao X; Guan Z; Ning Z; Qu L,Poultry science,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39013293/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38979640,Longevity extension in rats <i>via</i> improved redox homeostasis with high carbohydrate diet intervention from weaning to adulthood: a comprehensive multi-omics study.,"Early dietary patterns potentially influence the health status and lifespan throughout adulthood and the entire lifespan. However, dietary behaviors are difficult for everyone to control during adolescence. It is even more important to study the effects of interventions of early dietary patterns on the lifespan under arbitrary feeding conditions. The research involves observing the survival status and lifespan of rats from weaning to adulthood with three different dietary patterns (a high-carbohydrate diet (HC), a high-protein diet (HP), and a high-fat diet (HF)) under <i>ad libitum</i> feeding conditions. The administration of high-carbohydrate diets leads to a significant extension of both median and maximum survival times (<i>P</i> < 0.05) in Wistar rats. Furthermore, it markedly enhanced the spatial memory capacity, mitigated the occurrence of liver and kidney pathological outcomes in elderly rats, and increased the abundance of gut microbiota improving amino acid metabolism. Additionally, feeding rats a high-carbohydrate diet improved glutathione (GSH) synthesis and recycling and activated the expression and upregulation of the lifespan-related proteins Foxo3a/Sirt3 and the key metabolic enzyme GPX-4. The high-carbohydrate diet from weaning to adulthood may potentially extend the lifespan by enhancing rat systemic glutathione synthesis, recycling, and improving the redox state pathway.",Dong Y; Zhu Q; Li Y; Wang R; Xu W; Tang X; Li X; Lv X; Kong X; Cai L; Niu Y,Food & function,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38979640/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38913541,Gut microbial features and dietary fiber intake predict gut microbiota response to resistant starch supplementation.,"Resistant starch (RS) consumption can have beneficial effects on metabolic health, but the response, in terms of effects on the gut microbiota and host physiology, varies between individuals. Factors predicting the response to RS are not yet established and would be useful for developing precision nutrition approaches that maximize the benefits of dietary fiber intake. We sought to identify predictors of gut microbiota response to RS supplementation. We enrolled 76 healthy adults into a 7-week crossover study with 59 individuals completing the study. Participants consumed RS type 2 (RS2), RS type 4 (RS4), and digestible starch, for 10 d each with 5-d washout periods in between. We collected fecal and saliva samples and food records during each treatment period. We performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing and measured fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), salivary amylase (<i>AMY1</i>) gene copy number, and salivary amylase activity (SAA). Dietary fiber intake was predictive of the relative abundance of several amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) at the end of both RS treatments. <i>AMY1</i>-related metrics were not predictive of response to RS. SAA was only predictive of the relative abundance of one ASV after digestible starch supplementation. Interestingly, SCFA concentrations increased the most during digestible starch supplementation. Treatment order (the order of consumption of RS2 and RS4), alpha diversity, and a subset of ASVs were predictive of SCFA changes after RS supplementation. Based on our findings, dietary fiber intake and gut microbiome composition would be informative if assessed prior to recommending RS supplementation because these data can be used to predict changes in specific ASVs and fecal SCFA concentrations. These findings lay a foundation to support the premise that using a precision nutrition approach to optimize the benefits of dietary fibers such as RS could be an effective strategy to compensate for the low consumption of dietary fiber nationwide.",Devarakonda SLS; Superdock DK; Ren J; Johnson LM; Loinard-González AAP; Poole AC,Gut microbes,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38913541/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38908626,Tannic acid protects against colitis by regulating the IL17 - NFκB and microbiota - methylation pathways.,"Tannic acid, a bioactive polyphenol found in various phytogenic foods and medicinal plants, has potential prevention effects on colitis, though more evidence and mechanistic studies are required to substantiate this. In this study, we investigated the effects of different doses from 0 to 3 mg/mL of tannic acid on mice, ultimately selecting a dose of 3 mg/mL for the anti-colitis trial based on growth and intestinal morphology assessments. Using the DSS-induced colitis model, we found that tannic acid may alleviate colitis by inhibiting the IL-17 - NF-κB p65 signaling pathway and modulating epigenetic pathways, particularly methylation modifications. Additionally, tannic acid altered the gut microbiota, increasing the abundances of Prevotella, Eubacterium_siraeum_group, and Enterorhabdus in the colon. Supplementation with Eubacterium siraeum via gavage also inhibited colitis, accompanied by increased folate and methylation regulators in the colon. These findings suggest that tannic acid may inhibit colitis through the suppression of the IL-17 - NF-κB pathway and the enhancement of microbiota-mediated methylation pathways.",Wang M; Xu X; Sheng M; Zhang M; Wu F; Zhao Z; Guo M; Fang B; Wu J,International journal of biological macromolecules,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38908626/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38806467,Gut microbiome remodeling and metabolomic profile improves in response to protein pacing with intermittent fasting versus continuous caloric restriction.,"The gut microbiome (GM) modulates body weight/composition and gastrointestinal functioning; therefore, approaches targeting resident gut microbes have attracted considerable interest. Intermittent fasting (IF) and protein pacing (P) regimens are effective in facilitating weight loss (WL) and enhancing body composition. However, the interrelationships between IF- and P-induced WL and the GM are unknown. The current randomized controlled study describes distinct fecal microbial and plasma metabolomic signatures between combined IF-P (n = 21) versus a heart-healthy, calorie-restricted (CR, n = 20) diet matched for overall energy intake in free-living human participants (women = 27; men = 14) with overweight/obesity for 8 weeks. Gut symptomatology improves and abundance of Christensenellaceae microbes and circulating cytokines and amino acid metabolites favoring fat oxidation increase with IF-P (p < 0.05), whereas metabolites associated with a longevity-related metabolic pathway increase with CR (p < 0.05). Differences indicate GM and metabolomic factors play a role in WL maintenance and body composition. This novel work provides insight into the GM and metabolomic profile of participants following an IF-P or CR diet and highlights important differences in microbial assembly associated with WL and body composition responsiveness. These data may inform future GM-focused precision nutrition recommendations using larger sample sizes of longer duration.

38776919,A genomic compendium of cultivated human gut fungi characterizes the gut mycobiome and its relevance to common diseases.,"The gut fungal community represents an essential element of human health, yet its functional and metabolic potential remains insufficiently elucidated, largely due to the limited availability of reference genomes. To address this gap, we presented the cultivated gut fungi (CGF) catalog, encompassing 760 fungal genomes derived from the feces of healthy individuals. This catalog comprises 206 species spanning 48 families, including 69 species previously unidentified. We explored the functional and metabolic attributes of the CGF species and utilized this catalog to construct a phylogenetic representation of the gut mycobiome by analyzing over 11,000 fecal metagenomes from Chinese and non-Chinese populations. Moreover, we identified significant common disease-related variations in gut mycobiome composition and corroborated the associations between fungal signatures and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) through animal experimentation.

38767067,A comparative study of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms applied to human microbiome.,"The human microbiome, consisting of diverse bacte-rial, fungal, protozoan and viral species, exerts a profound influence on various physiological processes and disease susceptibility. However, the complexity of microbiome data has presented significant challenges in the analysis and interpretation of these intricate datasets, leading to the development of specialized software that employs machine learning algorithms for these aims. In this paper, we analyze raw data taken from 16S rRNA gene sequencing from three studies, including stool samples from healthy control, patients with adenoma, and patients with colorectal cancer. Firstly, we use network-based methods to reduce dimensions of the dataset and consider only the most important features. In addition, we employ supervised machine learning algorithms to make prediction. Results show that graph-based techniques reduces dimen-sion from 255 up to 78 features with modularity score 0.73 based on different centrality measures. On the other hand, projection methods (non-negative matrix factorization and principal component analysis) reduce dimensions to 7 features. Furthermore, we apply supervised machine learning algorithms on the most important features obtained from centrality measures and on the ones obtained from projection methods, founding that the evaluation metrics have approximately the same scores when applying the algorithms on the entire dataset, on 78 feature and on 7 features. This study demonstrates the efficacy of graph-based and projection methods in the interpretation for 16S rRNA gene sequencing data. Supervised machine learning on refined features from both approaches yields comparable predictive performance, emphasizing specific microbial features-bacteroides, prevotella, fusobacterium, lysinibacillus, blautia, sphingomonas, and faecalibacterium-as key in predicting patient conditions from raw data.",Kalluçi E; Preni B; Dhamo X; Noka E; Bardhi S; Macchia A; Bonetti G; Dhuli K; Donato K; Bertelli M; Zambrano LJM; Janaqi S,La Clinica terapeutica,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38767067/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38765070,From whole genomes to probiotic candidates: A study of potential lactobacilli strains selection for vaginitis treatment.,"Vaginitis, characterized by pathogenic invasion and a deficiency in beneficial lactobacilli, has recognized lactobacilli supplementation as a novel therapeutic strategy. However, due to individual differences in vaginal microbiota, identifying universally effective <i>Lactobacillus</i> strains is challenging. Traditional methodologies for probiotic selection, which heavily depend on extensive <i>in vitro</i> experiments, are both time-intensive and laborious. The aim of this study was to pinpoint possible vaginal probiotic candidates based on whole-genome screening. We sequenced the genomes of 98 previously isolated <i>Lactobacillus</i> strains, annotating their genes involved in probiotic metabolite biosynthesis, adherence, acid/bile tolerance, and antibiotic resistance. A scoring system was used to assess the strains based on their genomic profiles. The highest-scoring strains underwent further <i>in vitro</i> evaluation. Consequently, two strains, <i>Lactobacillus crispatus</i> LG55-27 and <i>Lactobacillus gasseri</i> TM13-16, displayed an outstanding ability to produce d-lactate and adhere to human vaginal epithelial cells. They also showed higher antimicrobial activity against <i>Gardnerella vaginalis, Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Candida albicans</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> compared to reference <i>Lactobacillus</i> strains. Their resilience to acid and bile environments highlights the potential for oral supplementation. Oral and vaginal administration of these two strains were tested in a bacterial vaginosis (BV) rat model at various doses. Results indicated that combined vaginal administration of these strains at 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/day significantly mitigated BV in rats.

38706560,Gut microbes differ in postmenopausal women responding to prunes to maintain hip bone mineral density.,"Foods high in phenolics such as prunes have been shown to exert protective effects on bone mineral density (BMD), but only certain individuals experience these benefits. This <i>post-hoc</i> analysis of a 12-month randomized controlled trial aimed to identify the relationship among the gut microbiome, immune responses, and bone protective effects of prunes on postmenopausal women. Subjects who consumed 50-100 g prunes daily were divided into responders (<i>n</i> = 20) and non-responders (<i>n</i> = 32) based on percent change in total hip bone mineral density (BMD, ≥1% or ≤-1% change, respectively). DXA scans were used to determine body composition and BMD. Immune markers were measured using immunoassays and flow cytometry. Targeted phenolic metabolites were analyzed using ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The fecal microbiota was characterized through 16S rRNA gene PCR amplicon sequencing. After 12 months of prune consumption, anti-inflammatory markers showed responders had significantly lower levels of IL-1β and TNF-α. QIIME2 sequence analysis showed that microbiomes of responders and non-responders differed in alpha (Shannon and Faith PD, Kruskal-Wallis <i>p</i> < 0.05) and beta diversity (unweighted Unifrac, PERMANOVA <i>p</i> < 0.04) metrics both before and after prune treatment. Furthermore, responders had a higher abundance of bacterial families Oscillospiraceae and Lachnospiraceae (ANCOM-BC <i>p</i> < 0.05). These findings provide evidence that postmenopausal women with initial low BMD can benefit from prunes if they host certain gut microbes.

38674791,<i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i> Supplementation Prevents Intestinal Barrier Injury and Gut Microflora Dysbiosis Induced by Sleep Deprivation.,"Sleep deprivation (SD) leads to impaired intestinal barrier function and intestinal flora disorder, especially a reduction in the abundance of the next generation of probiotic <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i> (<i>F. prausnitzii</i>). However, it remains largely unclear whether <i>F. prausnitzii</i> can ameliorate SD-induced intestinal barrier damage. A 72 h SD mouse model was used in this research, with or without the addition of <i>F. prausnitzii</i>. The findings indicated that pre-colonization with <i>F. prausnitzii</i> could protect against tissue damage from SD, enhance goblet cell count and MUC2 levels in the colon, boost tight-junction protein expression, decrease macrophage infiltration, suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and reduce apoptosis. We found that the presence of <i>F. prausnitzii</i> helped to balance the gut microbiota in SD mice by reducing harmful bacteria like <i>Klebsiella</i> and <i>Staphylococcus</i>, while increasing beneficial bacteria such as <i>Akkermansia</i>. Ion chromatography analysis revealed that <i>F. prausnitzii</i> pretreatment increased the fecal butyrate level in SD mice. Overall, these results suggested that incorporating <i>F. prausnitzii</i> could help reduce gut damage caused by SD, potentially by enhancing the intestinal barrier and balancing gut microflora. This provides a foundation for utilizing probiotics to protect against intestinal illnesses.",Wang X; Li Y; Wang X; Wang R; Hao Y; Ren F; Wang P; Fang B,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38674791/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38663772,Alleviating effect of vagus nerve cutting in Salmonella-induced gut infections and anxiety-like behavior via enhancing microbiota-derived GABA.,"The vagus nerve, a pivotal link within the gut-brain axis, plays a critical role in maintaining homeostasis and mediating communication between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain. It has been reported that gastrointestinal infection by Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium) triggers gut inflammation and manifests as anxiety-like behaviors, yet the mechanistic involvement of the vagus nerve remains to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that unilateral cervical vagotomy markedly attenuated anxiety-like behaviors induced by S. typhimurium SL1344 infection in C57BL/6 mice, as evidenced by the open field test and marble burying experiment. Furthermore, vagotomy significantly diminished neuronal activation within the nucleus of the solitary tract and amygdala, alongside mitigating aberrant glial cell activation in the hippocampus and amygdala. Additionally, vagotomy notably decreases serum endotoxin levels, counters the increase in splenic Salmonella concentration, and modulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines-including IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α-in both the gastrointestinal tract and brain, with a concurrent reduction in IL-22 and CXCL1 expression. This intervention also fostered the enrichment of beneficial gut microbiota, including Alistipes and Lactobacillus species, and augmented the production of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the gut. Administration of GABA replicated the vagotomy's beneficial effects on reducing gut inflammation and anxiety-like behavior in infected mice. However, blockade of GABA receptors with picrotoxin abrogated the vagotomy's protective effects against gut inflammation, without influencing its impact on anxiety-like behaviors. Collectively, these findings suggest that vagotomy exerts a protective effect against infection by promoting GABA synthesis in the colon and alleviating anxiety-like behavior. This study underscores the critical role of the vagus nerve in relaying signals of gut infection to the brain and posits that targeting the gut-brain axis may offer a novel and efficacious approach to preventing gastrointestinal infections and associated behavioral abnormalities.",Zou Q; Han S; Liang J; Yan G; Wang Q; Wang Y; Zhang Z; Hu J; Li J; Yuan T; Liu Z,"Brain, behavior, and immunity",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38663772/,0,0,0,0,0,0

38463766,Genomic and functional diversity of cultivated <i>Bifidobacterium</i> from human gut microbiota.,"The genus <i>Bifidobacterium</i> widely exists in human gut and has been increasingly used as the adjuvant probiotics for the prevention and treatment of diseases. However, the functional differences of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> genomes from different regions of the world remain unclear. We here describe an extensive study on the genomic characteristics and function annotations of 1512 genomes (clustered to 849 non-redundant genomes) of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> cultured from human gut. The distribution of some carbohydrate-active enzymes varied among different <i>Bifidobacterium</i> species and continents. More than 36% of the genomes of <i>B. pseudocatenulatum</i> harbored biosynthetic gene clusters of lanthipeptide-class-iv. 99.76% of the cultivated genomes of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> harbored genes of bile salt hydrolase. Most genomes of <i>B. adolescentis</i>, and all genomes of <i>B. dentium</i> harbored genes involved in gamma-aminobutyric acid synthesis. <i>B. longum</i> subsp. <i>infantis</i> were characterized harboring most genes related to human milk oligosaccharide utilization. Significant differences between the distribution of antibiotic resistance genes among different species and continents revealed the importance to use antibiotics precisely in the clinical treatment. Phages infecting <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and horizontal gene transfers occurring in genomes of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> were dependent on species and region sources, and might help <i>Bifidobacterium</i> adapt to the environment. In addition, the distribution of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> in human gut was found varied from different regions of the world. This study represents a comprehensive view of characteristics and functions of genomes of cultivated <i>Bifidobacterium</i> from human gut, and enables clinical advances in the future.",Li W; Liang H; He W; Gao X; Wu Z; Hu T; Lin X; Wang M; Zhong Y; Zhang H; Ge L; Jin X; Xiao L; Zou Y,Heliyon,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38463766/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38437939,Construction of nanoparticles from blueberry anthocyanins-lecithin/gum Arabic improves lipid droplet accumulation and gut microbiota disturbance in HFD-induced obese mice.,"The digestive instability of anthocyanins (ACNs) limits their application in food nutrition, especially precision nutrition. Blueberry ACNs-loaded nanoparticles (Lipo/GA-ACNs NPs) were prepared using gum arabic (GA) as the delivery carrier and liposomal vesicles (Lipo) prepared from soy lecithin as the targeting scaffold. The average particle size of the NPs was 99.4 nm, and the polydispersion index (PDI) was 0.46. The results showed that the presence of the Lipo-GA matrix enhanced the NPs' in vitro stability and antioxidant activity. In addition, the in vitro biocompatibility, uptake ability, lipid-lowering activity, and free-radical scavenging ability were improved to a certain extent. In a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mouse model, oral administration of ACNs-LNP (LNP, liver-targeted nanoparticle) showed better effects on body weight, liver injury, and lipid droplet accumulation in the liver than ACNs. In addition, ACNs-LNP also played a role in regulating HFD-induced gut microbiota imbalance. These results provide a promising ACNs delivery strategy with the potential to be developed into a functional food that targets the liver to prevent fatty liver.",Cheng Z; Wei W; Chen Y; Xu A; Wang Y; Li B,International journal of biological macromolecules,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38437939/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38414488,Revisiting multi-omics-based predictors of the plasma triglyceride response to an omega-3 fatty acid supplementation.,"The aim of the present study was to identify the metabolomic signature of responders and non-responders to an omega-3 fatty acid (n-3 FA) supplementation, and to test the ability of a multi-omics classifier combining genomic, lipidomic, and metabolomic features to discriminate plasma triglyceride (TG) response phenotypes. A total of 208 participants of the Fatty Acid Sensor (FAS). Study took 5 g per day of fish oil, providing 1.9-2.2 g eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 1.1 g docosahexaenoic (DHA) daily over a 6-week period, and were further divided into two subgroups: responders and non-responders, according to the change in plasma TG levels after the supplementation. Changes in plasma levels of 6 short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and 25 bile acids (BA) during the intervention were compared between subgroups using a linear mixed model, and the impact of SCFAs and BAs on the TG response was tested in a mediation analysis. Genotyping was conducted using the Illumina Human Omni-5 Quad BeadChip. Mass spectrometry was used to quantify plasma TG and cholesterol esters levels, as well as plasma SCFA and BA levels. A classifier was developed and tested within the DIABLO framework, which implements a partial least squares-discriminant analysis to multi-omics analysis. Different classifiers were developed by combining data from genomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics. Plasma levels of none of the SCFAs or BAs measured before and after the n-3 FA supplementation were significantly different between responders and non-responders. SCFAs but not BAs were marginally relevant in the classification of plasma TG responses. A classifier built by adding plasma SCFAs and lipidomic layers to genomic data was able to even the accuracy of 85% shown by the genomic predictor alone. These results inform on the marginal relevance of SCFA and BA plasma levels as surrogate measures of gut microbiome in the assessment of the interindividual variability observed in the plasma TG response to an n-3 FA supplementation. Genomic data still represent the best predictor of plasma TG response, and the inclusion of metabolomic data added little to the ability to discriminate the plasma TG response phenotypes.",Morin-Bernier J; de Toro-Martín J; Barbe V; San-Cristobal R; Lemieux S; Rudkowska I; Couture P; Barbier O; Vohl MC,Frontiers in nutrition,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38414488/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38398805,Dietary Isoeugenol Supplementation Attenuates Chronic UVB-Induced Skin Photoaging and Modulates Gut Microbiota in Mice.,"Photoaging, the primary cause of skin aging damage, results from chronic ultraviolet (UV) exposure, leading to dryness and wrinkle formation. Nutritional intervention has emerged as a practical approach for preventing and addressing the effect of skin photoaging. The primary aromatic compound isolated from clove oil, isoeugenol (IE), has antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant qualities that work to effectively restrict skin cancer cell proliferation. This investigation delved into the advantages of IE in alleviating skin photoaging using UVB-irradiated skin fibroblasts and female SKH-1 hairless mouse models. IE alleviated UVB-induced photodamage in Hs68 dermal fibroblasts by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase secretion and promoting extracellular matrix synthesis. In photoaged mice, dietary IE reduced wrinkles, relieved skin dryness, inhibited epidermal thickening, and prevented collagen loss. Additionally, the intestinal dysbiosis caused by prolonged UVB exposure was reduced with an IE intervention. The results of Spearman's analysis showed a strong correlation between skin photoaging and gut microbiota. Given the almost unavoidable UVB exposure in contemporary living, this research demonstrated the efficacy of dietary IE in reversing skin photoaging, presenting a promising approach to tackle concerns related to extrinsic skin aging.",Geng R; Kang SG; Huang K; Tong T,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38398805/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38323712,Differential effects of four laboratory animal control diets on gut microbiota in mice.,"The gut microbiota is intricate and susceptible to multiple factors, with diet being a major contributor. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of four commonly used laboratory animal control diets, namely Keao Xieli's maintenance diet (KX), HFK's 1025 (HF), Research Diets' D12450B (RD), and Lab Diet's 5CC4 (LD), on the gut microbiota of mice. A total of 40 mice were randomly assigned to four groups, and each group was fed one of the four diets for a duration of 8 weeks. The assessment of gut microbiota was conducted using 16S rRNA sequencing both at the beginning of the study (week 0) and the end (week 8), which served as the baseline and endpoint samples, respectively. Following the 8-week feeding period, no significant differences were observed in physiological parameters, including body weight, visceral weight, and blood biochemical indices, across the four groups. Nonetheless, relative to the baseline, discernible alterations in the gut microbiota were observed in all groups, encompassing shifts in beta-diversity, hierarchical clustering, and key genera. Among the four diets, HF diet exhibited a significant influence on alpha-diversity, RD diet brought about notable changes in microbial composition at the phylum level, and LD diet demonstrated an interconnected co-occurrence network. Mantel analysis indicated no significant correlation between physiological parameters and gut microbiota in the four groups. Overall, our study demonstrated that the four control diets had a minimal impact on physiological parameters, while exerting a distinct influence on the gut microbiota after 8 weeks. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",Guo J; Zhao Y; Kang SG; Huang K; Tong T,Journal of the science of food and agriculture,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38323712/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38316796,Short-term periodic restricted feeding elicits metabolome-microbiome signatures with sex dimorphic persistence in primate intervention.,"Dietary restriction has shown benefits in physiological, metabolic, and molecular signatures associated with aging but is a difficult lifestyle to maintain for most individuals. In mice, a less restrictive diet that allows for cyclical periods of reduced calories mitigates aging phenotypes, yet the effects of such an intervention in a genetically heterogenous, higher-order mammal has not been examined. Here, using middle-aged rhesus macaques matched for age and sex, we show that a regimen of 4 days of low-calorie intake followed by 10 days of ad libitum feeding (4:10 diet) performed in repeating cycles over 12 weeks led to significant loss of weight and fat percentage, despite the free access to food for most of the study duration. We show the 4-day restriction period is sufficient to drive alterations to the serum metabolome characterized by substantial differences in lipid classes. These phenotypes were paralleled by changes in the gut microbiome of restricted monkeys that highlight the involvement of a microbiome-metabolome axis. This regimen shows promising phenotypes, with some sex-dimorphic responses, including residual memory of the diet. As many calorie restriction interventions are difficult to sustain, we propose that this short-term diet may be easier to adhere to and have benefits directly relevant to human aging.",Yanai H; Park B; Koh H; Jang HJ; Vaughan KL; Tanaka-Yano M; Aon M; Blanton M; Messaoudi I; Diaz-Ruiz A; Mattison JA; Beerman I,Nature communications,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38316796/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38288711,"Quantifying Gut Microbial Short-Chain Fatty Acids and Their Isotopomers in Mechanistic Studies Using a Rapid, Readily Expandable LC-MS Platform.","Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) comprise the largest group of gut microbial fermentation products. While absorption of most nutrients occurs in the small intestine, indigestible dietary components, such as fiber, reach the colon and are processed by the gut microbiome to produce a wide array of metabolites that influence host physiology. Numerous studies have implicated SCFAs as key modulators of host health, such as in regulating irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, robust methods are still required for their detection and quantitation to meet the demands of biological studies probing the complex interplay of the gut-host-health paradigm. In this study, a sensitive, rapid-throughput, and readily expandible UHPLC-QqQ-MS platform using 2-PA derivatization was developed for the quantitation of gut-microbially derived SCFAs, related metabolites, and isotopically labeled homologues. The utility of this platform was then demonstrated by investigating the production of SCFAs in cecal contents from mice feeding studies, human fecal bioreactors, and fecal/bacterial fermentations of isotopically labeled dietary carbohydrates. Overall, the workflow proposed in this study serves as an invaluable tool for the rapidly expanding gut-microbiome and precision nutrition research field.",Weng CC; Suarez C; Cheang SE; Couture G; Goodson ML; Barboza M; Kalanetra KM; Masarweh CF; Mills DA; Raybould HE; Lebrilla CB,Analytical chemistry,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38288711/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38223254,Predicting metabolomic profiles from microbial composition through neural ordinary differential equations.,"Characterizing the metabolic profile of a microbial community is crucial for understanding its biological function and its impact on the host or environment. Metabolomics experiments directly measuring these profiles are difficult and expensive, while sequencing methods quantifying the species composition of microbial communities are well-developed and relatively cost-effective. Computational methods that are capable of predicting metabolomic profiles from microbial compositions can save considerable efforts needed for metabolomic profiling experimentally. Yet, despite existing efforts, we still lack a computational method with high prediction power, general applicability, and great interpretability. Here we develop a method - mNODE (Metabolomic profile predictor using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations), based on a state-of-the-art family of deep neural network models. We show compelling evidence that mNODE outperforms existing methods in predicting the metabolomic profiles of human microbiomes and several environmental microbiomes. Moreover, in the case of human gut microbiomes, mNODE can naturally incorporate dietary information to further enhance the prediction of metabolomic profiles. Besides, susceptibility analysis of mNODE enables us to reveal microbe-metabolite interactions, which can be validated using both synthetic and real data. The presented results demonstrate that mNODE is a powerful tool to investigate the microbiome-diet-metabolome relationship, facilitating future research on precision nutrition.",Wang T; Wang XW; Lee-Sarwar KA; Litonjua AA; Weiss ST; Sun Y; Maslov S; Liu YY,Nature machine intelligence,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38223254/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38143283,"Sulforaphane and Sulforaphane-Nitrile Metabolism in Humans Following Broccoli Sprout Consumption: Inter-individual Variation, Association with Gut Microbiome Composition, and Differential Bioactivity.","The glucosinolate glucoraphanin from broccoli is converted to sulforaphane (SFN) or sulforaphane-nitrile (SFN-NIT) by plant enzymes or the gut microbiome. Human feeding studies typically observe high inter-individual variation in absorption and excretion of SFN, however, the source of this variation is not fully known. To address this, a human feeding trial to comprehensively evaluate inter-individual variation in the absorption and excretion of all known SFN metabolites in urine, plasma, and stool, and tested the hypothesis that gut microbiome composition influences inter-individual variation in total SFN excretion has been conducted. Participants (n = 55) consumed a single serving of broccoli or alfalfa sprouts and plasma, stool, and total urine are collected over 72 h for quantification of SFN metabolites and gut microbiome profiling using 16S gene sequencing. SFN-NIT excretion is markedly slower than SFN excretion (72 h vs 24 h). Members of genus Bifidobacterium, Dorea, and Ruminococcus torques are positively associated with SFN metabolite excretion while members of genus Alistipes and Blautia has a negative association. This is the first report of SFN-NIT metabolite levels in human plasma, urine, and stool following consumption of broccoli sprouts. The results help explain factors driving inter-individual variation in SFN metabolism and are relevant for precision nutrition.",Bouranis JA; Beaver LM; Wong CP; Choi J; Hamer S; Davis EW; Brown KS; Jiang D; Sharpton TJ; Stevens JF; Ho E,Molecular nutrition & food research,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38143283/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38126115,Safety assessment of potential probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus AM13-1 with high cholesterol-lowering capability isolated from human gut.,"An important risk factor for cardiovascular disease is dyslipidemia, especially abnormal cholesterol levels. The relation between probiotics and cholesterol-lowering capability has been extensively studied. Lactobacillus acidophilus plays a significant role in affecting host health, and produces multitudinous metabolites, which have prohibitory functions against pathogenic microorganisms. In this study, we identified a cholesterol-lowering strain AM13-1, isolated from a fecal sample obtained from a healthy adult male, and performed comprehensive function analysis by whole-genome analysis and in vitro experiments. Genome analyses of L. acidophilus AM13-1 revealed that carbohydrate and amino acid transport, metabolism, translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis are abundant categories of functional genes. No virulence factors or toxin genes with experimentally verified were found in the genome of strain AM13-1. Besides, plenty of probiotic-related genes were predicted from the L. acidophilus AM13-1 genome, such as cbh, atpA-D, and dltD, with functions related to cholesterol-lowering and acid resistance. And strain AM13-1 showed high-efficiency of bile salt hydrolase activity and the capacity for removing cholesterol with efficiency rates of 70%. These function properties indicate that strain AM13-1 can be considered as a probiotic candidate for use in food and health care products.",Liu X; Wang M; Hu T; Lin X; Liang H; Li W; Zhao S; Zhong Y; Zhang H; Ge L; Jin X; Xiao L; Zou Y,Letters in applied microbiology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38126115/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38068719,Artemether Attenuates Gut Barrier Dysfunction and Intestinal Flora Imbalance in High-Fat and High-Fructose Diet-Fed Mice.,"Intestinal inflammation is a key determinant of intestinal and systemic health, and when our intestines are damaged, there is disruption of the intestinal barrier, which in turn induces a systemic inflammatory response. However, the etiology and pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases of the intestine are still not fully understood. Artemether (ART), one of the artemisinin derivatives, has been widely used to treat malaria. Nevertheless, the effect of ART on intestinal inflammation remains unclear. The present study intended to elucidate the potential mechanism of ART in diet-induced intestinal injury. A high-fat and high-fructose (HFHF) diet-induced mouse model of intestinal injury was constructed, and the mice were treated with ART to examine their role in intestinal injury. RT-qPCR, Western blotting, immunohistochemical staining, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing were used to investigate the anti-intestinal inflammation effect and mechanism of ART. The results indicated that ART intervention may significantly ameliorate the intestinal flora imbalance caused by the HFHF diet and alleviate intestinal barrier function disorders and inflammatory responses by raising the expression of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin and decreasing the expression of pro-inflammatory factors TNF-α and IL-1β. Moreover, ART intervention restrained HFHF-induced activation of the TLR4/NF-κB p65 pathway in colon tissue, which may be concerned with the potential protective effect of ART on intestinal inflammation. ART might provide new insights into further explaining the mechanism of action of other metabolic diseases caused by intestinal disorders.",Ren X; Xu J; Xu Y; Wang Q; Huang K; He X,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38068719/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38015106,Age-dependent changes in the gut microbiota and serum metabolome correlate with renal function and human aging.,"Human aging is invariably accompanied by a decline in renal function, a process potentially exacerbated by uremic toxins originating from gut microbes. Based on a registered household Chinese Guangxi longevity cohort (n = 151), we conducted comprehensive profiling of the gut microbiota and serum metabolome of individuals from 22 to 111 years of age and validated the findings in two independent East Asian aging cohorts (Japan aging cohort n = 330, Yunnan aging cohort n = 80), identifying unique age-dependent differences in the microbiota and serum metabolome. We discovered that the influence of the gut microbiota on serum metabolites intensifies with advancing age. Furthermore, mediation analyses unveiled putative causal relationships between the gut microbiota (Escherichia coli, Odoribacter splanchnicus, and Desulfovibrio piger) and serum metabolite markers related to impaired renal function (p-cresol, N-phenylacetylglutamine, 2-oxindole, and 4-aminohippuric acid) and aging. The fecal microbiota transplantation experiment demonstrated that the feces of elderly individuals could influence markers related to impaired renal function in the serum. Our findings reveal novel links between age-dependent alterations in the gut microbiota and serum metabolite markers of impaired renal function, providing novel insights into the effects of microbiota-metabolite interplay on renal function and healthy aging.",Sun L; Li Z; Hu C; Ding J; Zhou Q; Pang G; Wu Z; Yang R; Li S; Li J; Cai J; Sun Y; Li R; Zhen H; Sun S; Zhang J; Fang M; Chen Z; Lv Y; Cao Q; Sun Y; Gong R; Huang Z; Duan Y; Liu H; Dong J; Li J; Ruan J; Lu H; He B; Li N; Li T; Xue W; Li Y; Shen J; Yang F; Zhao C; Liang Q; Zhang M; Chen C; Gong H; Hou Y; Wang J; Zhang Y; Yang H; Zhu S; Xiao L; Jin Z; Guo H; Zhao P; Brix S; Xu X; Jia H; Kristiansen K; Yang Z; Nie C,Aging cell,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38015106/,0,0,0,0,0,0
37865354,Integrated analysis of microbiome and host transcriptome reveals the damage/protective mechanism of corn oil and olive oil on the gut health of grouper (♀ Epinephelus fuscoguttatus × ♂ E. lanceolatu).,"As digestive and immune organs of animals, the gut was frequently used to evaluate the health status of aquatic animals. In previous oil source alternatives study, corn oil (CO) had been found to induce gut inflammation, while olive oil (OO) had been found to be effective in protecting intestinal health. Three diets with different oil sources (fish oil, CO, OO) were formulated for an 8-week culture experiment, and it was proposed to combine 16S sequencing and transcriptome sequencing analysis to preliminarily elucidate the damage/protection mechanism of CO and OO on the gut health of grouper (♀ Epinephelus fuscoguttatus × ♂ E. lanceolatu). We found that CO indeed damaged to gut health and destroyed the gut structure, while OO had a positive outcome in protecting the gut structure, promoting digestibility and relieving enteritis. Photobacterium, Romboutsia and Epulopiscium were significantly enriched in OO group and Staphylococcus were significantly enriched in CO group. Transcriptome sequencing further revealed CO could activated Complement and coagulation cascades, Staphylococcus aureus infection, Systemic lupus erythematosus, and Tuberculosis pathways; conversely, OO activated B-cell signaling receptors, promoted B-cell proliferation and apoptosis, and thus activated B-cell signaling pathways to enhance immunity, whereas OO can regulate IL17 signaling pathway and TNF signaling pathway to inhibit NF-κB signaling pathway to reduce pro-inflammatory response. By integrating the microbiome and transcriptome, further identified all differential microorganisms were directly and significantly correlated with differential genes, and Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Romboutsia, Staphylococcus might as the core regulates the expression of differential gene in the organism. These results reveal that different oil sources alter gut gene expression mainly by modulating the composition and abundance of gut microbiota, further regulating the health status of the gut.

37828586,Metagenome-wide analysis uncovers gut microbial signatures and implicates taxon-specific functions in end-stage renal disease.,"The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in regulating host metabolism and producing uremic toxins in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Our objective is to advance toward a holistic understanding of the gut ecosystem and its functional capacity in such patients, which is still lacking. Herein, we explore the gut microbiome of 378 hemodialytic ESRD patients and 290 healthy volunteers from two independent cohorts via deep metagenomic sequencing and metagenome-assembled-genome-based characterization of their feces. Our findings reveal fundamental alterations in the ESRD microbiome, characterized by a panel of 348 differentially abundant species, including ESRD-elevated representatives of Blautia spp., Dorea spp., and Eggerthellaceae, and ESRD-depleted Prevotella and Roseburia species. Through functional annotation of the ESRD-associated species, we uncover various taxon-specific functions linked to the disease, such as antimicrobial resistance, aromatic compound degradation, and biosynthesis of small bioactive molecules. Additionally, we show that the gut microbial composition can be utilized to predict serum uremic toxin concentrations, and based on this, we identify the key toxin-contributing species. Furthermore, our investigation extended to 47 additional non-dialyzed chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, revealing a significant correlation between the abundance of ESRD-associated microbial signatures and CKD progression. This study delineates the taxonomic and functional landscapes and biomarkers of the ESRD microbiome. Understanding the role of gut microbiota in ESRD could open new avenues for therapeutic interventions and personalized treatment approaches in patients with this condition.",Zhang P; Wang X; Li S; Cao X; Zou J; Fang Y; Shi Y; Xiang F; Shen B; Li Y; Fang B; Zhang Y; Guo R; Lv Q; Zhang L; Lu Y; Wang Y; Yu J; Xie Y; Wang R; Chen X; Yu J; Zhang Z; He J; Zhan J; Lv W; Nie Y; Cai J; Xu X; Hu J; Zhang Q; Gao T; Jiang X; Tan X; Xue N; Wang Y; Ren Y; Wang L; Zhang H; Ning Y; Chen J; Zhang L; Jin S; Ren F; Ehrlich SD; Zhao L; Ding X,Genome biology,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37828586/,0,0,0,0,0,0

37784178,"Analysis of strain, sex, and diet-dependent modulation of gut microbiota reveals candidate keystone organisms driving microbial diversity in response to American and ketogenic diets.","The gut microbiota is modulated by a combination of diet, host genetics, and sex effects. The magnitude of these effects and interactions among them is important to understanding inter-individual variability in gut microbiota. In a previous study, mouse strain-specific responses to American and ketogenic diets were observed along with several QTLs for metabolic traits. In the current study, we searched for genetic variants underlying differences in the gut microbiota in response to American and ketogenic diets, which are high in fat and vary in carbohydrate composition, between C57BL/6 J (B6) and FVB/NJ (FVB) mouse strains. Genetic mapping of microbial features revealed 18 loci under the QTL model (i.e., marginal effects that are not specific to diet or sex), 12 loci under the QTL by diet model, and 1 locus under the QTL by sex model. Multiple metabolic and microbial features map to the distal part of Chr 1 and Chr 16 along with eigenvectors extracted from principal coordinate analysis of measures of β-diversity. Bilophila, Ruminiclostridium 9, and Rikenella (Chr 1) were identified as sex- and diet-independent QTL candidate keystone organisms, and Parabacteroides (Chr 16) was identified as a diet-specific, candidate keystone organism in confirmatory factor analyses of traits mapping to these regions. For many microbial features, irrespective of which QTL model was used, diet or the interaction between diet and a genotype were the strongest predictors of the abundance of each microbial trait. Sex, while important to the analyses, was not as strong of a predictor for microbial abundances. These results demonstrate that sex, diet, and genetic background have different magnitudes of effects on inter-individual differences in gut microbiota. Therefore, Precision Nutrition through the integration of genetic variation, microbiota, and sex affecting microbiota variation will be important to predict response to diets varying in carbohydrate composition.

37764715,Unraveling the Gut Microbiome-Diet Connection: Exploring the Impact of Digital Precision and Personalized Nutrition on Microbiota Composition and Host Physiology.,"The human gut microbiome, an intricate ecosystem housing trillions of microorganisms within the gastrointestinal tract, holds significant importance in human health and the development of diseases. Recent advances in technology have allowed for an in-depth exploration of the gut microbiome, shedding light on its composition and functions. Of particular interest is the role of diet in shaping the gut microbiome, influencing its diversity, population size, and metabolic functions. Precision nutrition, a personalized approach based on individual characteristics, has shown promise in directly impacting the composition of the gut microbiome. However, to fully understand the long-term effects of specific diets and food components on the gut microbiome and to identify the variations between individuals, longitudinal studies are crucial. Additionally, precise methods for collecting dietary data, alongside the application of machine learning techniques, hold immense potential in comprehending the gut microbiome's response to diet and providing tailored lifestyle recommendations. In this study, we investigated the complex mechanisms that govern the diverse impacts of nutrients and specific foods on the equilibrium and functioning of the individual gut microbiome of seven volunteers (four females and three males) with an average age of 40.9 ± 10.3 years, aiming at identifying potential therapeutic targets, thus making valuable contributions to the field of personalized nutrition.

Inulin has shown the potential to mitigate dysbiosis. However, it remains unclear whether the dietary response varies depending on sex. In the study, we fed 4-month-old APOE4 mice with inulin for 16 weeks and performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing to determine changes in microbiome diversity, taxonomy, and functional gene pathways. We also formed the same experiments with APOE3 mice to identify whether there are APOE-genotype dependent responses to inulin. We found that APOE4 female mice fed with inulin had restored alpha diversity, significantly reduced Escherichia coli and inflammation-associated pathway responses. However, compared with APOE4 male mice, they had less metabolic responses, including the levels of short-chain fatty acids-producing bacteria and the associated kinases, especially those related to acetate and Erysipelotrichaceae. These diet- and sex- effects were less pronounced in the APOE3 mice, indicating that different APOE variants also play a significant role. The findings provide insights into the higher susceptibility of APOE4 females to AD, potentially due to inefficient energy production, and imply the importance of considering precision nutrition for mitigating dysbiosis and AD risk in the future.",Chang YH; Yanckello LM; Chlipala GE; Green SJ; Aware C; Runge A; Xing X; Chen A; Wenger K; Flemister A; Wan C; Lin AL,Scientific reports,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37704738/,0,0,0,0,0,0
37653259,Dietary supplementation of ark clams protects gut health and modifies gut microbiota in d-galactose-induced aging rats.,"Ark clams, a seafood abundant in various nutrients, are widely consumed worldwide. This study aimed to investigate the protective benefits of two common ark clams in Korea, Scapharca subcrenata (SS) and Tegillarca granosa (TG), on gut health in d-galactose (d-gal)-induced aging rats. Thirty-two Wistar rats (11 weeks old) were randomly allocated into four groups: a CON group (normal diet + saline intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection), a CD group (normal diet + d-gal i.p. injection), an SS group (normal diet with 5% SS supplementation + d-gal i.p. injection), and a TG group (normal diet with 5% TG supplementation + d-gal i.p. injection). After 12 weeks of treatment, histopathological results showed that gut barrier damage was alleviated in rats of the SS and TG groups, as evidenced by increases in mucus layer thickness and goblet cell numbers. Meanwhile, the two groups supplemented with ark clams showed an evident reduction in oxidative stress biomarkers (malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl content levels in the colon) and an increase in the immune-related factor (immunoglobulin A level in the plasma) in rats. The 16S ribosomal RNA analysis revealed that SS and TG ark clams significantly increased the proliferations of Bacteroidetes at the phylum level and Parabacteroides at the genus level. Additionally, the levels of the three main short-chain fatty acids in the cecal contents were also significantly increased in the SS and TG groups.

The results showed that both dietary LMP and HMP consistently upregulated intestinal zonula occludens protein 1 (Zo-1), Caludin-1, and Caludin-4, and downregulated intestinal tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) gene expression (P < 0.05). Dietary HMP separately upregulated intestinal Occludin, nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), and Bcl-2 associated agonist of cell death (BAD) gene expression, as well as the digesta propionate content, OTUs, Sobs, Shannon, Chao, and ACE indices (P < 0.05), whereas dietary LMP decreased digesta arginine, 4-aminobutyric, L-tyrosine, and phenylalanine contents (P < 0.05). Moreover, dietary HMP decreased plasma lipopolysaccharide and d-lactic acid contents and increased intestinal superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities and immunoglobulin (Ig) receptor and IgM levels (P < 0.05). Collectively, dietary HMP improves intestinal health by increasing intestinal flora α-diversity and enhancing intestinal mechanical barrier, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immune functions. On the contrary, the interference of dietary LMP with butyrate, tyrosine, arginine, and 4-aminobutyric acid metabolism is the main reason for its detrimental effects on intestinal health.",Liu Y; Zhou H; Fan J; Huang H; Deng J; Tan B,International journal of biological macromolecules,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37591422/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Previous studies suggested that supplementation with live <i>Lactobacillus</i> may benefit the recovery of BV, however, the outcomes vary in people from different regions. Herein, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of oral Chinese-origin <i>Lactobacillus</i> with adjuvant metronidazole (MET) on treating Chinese BV patients. In total, 67 Chinese women with BV were enrolled in this parallel controlled trial and randomly assigned to two study groups: a control group treated with MET vaginal suppositories for 7 days and a probiotic group treated with oral <i>Lactobacillus gasseri</i> TM13 and <i>Lactobacillus crispatus</i> LG55 as an adjuvant to MET for 30 days. By comparing the participants with Nugent Scores ≥ 7 and < 7 on days 14, 30, and 90, we found that oral administration of probiotics did not improve BV cure rates (72.73% and 84.00% at day 14, 57.14% and 60.00% at day 30, 32.14% and 48.39% at day 90 for probiotic and control group respectively). However, the probiotics were effective in restoring vaginal health after cure by showing higher proportion of participants with Nugent Scores < 4 in the probiotic group compared to the control group (87.50% and 71.43% on day 14, 93.75% and 88.89% on day 30, and 77.78% and 66.67% on day 90). The relative abundance of the probiotic strains was significantly increased in the intestinal microbiome of the probiotic group compared to the control group at day 14, but no significance was detected after 30 and 90 days. Also, the probiotics were not detected in vaginal microbiome, suggesting that <i>L. gasseri</i> TM13 and <i>L. crispatus</i> LG55 mainly acted through the intestine. A higher abundance of <i>Prevotella timonensis</i> at baseline was significantly associated with long-term cure failure of BV and greatly contributed to the enrichment of the lipid IVA synthesis pathway, which could aggravate inflammation response.

37540026,Diallyl trisulfide ameliorates bone loss and alters specific gut microbiota and serum metabolites in natural aging mice.,"Aging is a major cause of bone loss and osteoporosis. Diallyl trisulfide (DATS), one of the main organic sulfides in garlic oil, has been shown to alleviate arthritis in mice. However, further research is still needed to determine how DATS affects bone formation and bone loss in aging mice. Here, we established a mouse model of natural aging for dietary DATS intervention. DATS treatment improved the bone microstructure, including the disorganized arrangement of bone trabeculae and promoted collagen synthesis, as confirmed by micro-CT and histological analyses. The abundance of beneficial bacteria for bone formation, such as Clostridiaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae, and the microbial diversity and community richness were all altered by DATS, according to 16S rRNA sequencing data. 14 potential biomarkers and 9 important metabolic pathways were examined using serum metabolomics analysis. Additionally, there has been a significant reduction in sphingosine, which is directly associated with bone metabolism. The level of sphingosine and relative abundance of <i>Clostridium</i> were found to be negatively correlated by correlation analysis, indicating that bacteria may regulate bone reconstruction <i>via</i> influencing metabolites. Furthermore, <i>Runx2</i> and <i>β-catenin</i> gene expression levels increased in bones, which may be related to the ameliorative mechanism of DATS.

37536565,Perspective: Challenges and Future Directions in Clinical Research with Nuts and Berries.,"Consumption of nuts and berries are considered part of a healthy eating pattern. Nuts and berries contain a complex nutrient profile consisting of essential vitamins and minerals, fiber, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and phenolics in quantities that improve physiological outcomes. The spectrum of health outcomes that may be impacted by the consumptions of nuts and berries includes cardiovascular, gut microbiome, and cognitive, among others. Recently, new insights regarding the bioactive compounds found in both nuts and berries have reinforced their role for use in precision nutrition efforts. However, challenges exist that can affect the generalizability of outcomes from clinical studies, including inconsistency in study designs, homogeneity of test populations, variability in test products and control foods, and assessing realistic portion sizes.

37530428,Citizen science helps to raise awareness about gut microbiome health in people at risk of developing non-communicable diseases.,"Citizens lack knowledge about the impact of gut microbiota on health and how lifestyle and dietary choices can influence it, leading to Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and affecting overall well-being. Participatory action research (PAR) is a promising approach to enhance communication and encourage individuals to adopt healthier behaviors and improve their health. In this study, we explored the feasibility of integrating the photovoice method with citizen science approaches to assess the impact of social and environmental factors on gut microbiota health. In this context, citizen science approaches entailed the involvement of participants in the collection of samples for subsequent analysis, specifically gut microbiome assessment via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We recruited 70 volunteers and organized six photovoice groups based on age and educational background. Participants selected 64 photographs that represented the influence of daily habits on gut microbiota health and created four photovoice themes. Analysis of the gut microbiome using 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified 474 taxa, and in-depth microbial analysis revealed three clusters of people based on gut microbiome diversity and body mass index (BMI). Our findings indicate that participants enhanced their knowledge of gut microbiome health through PAR activities, and we found a correlation between lower microbial diversity, higher BMI, and better achievement of learning outcomes. Using PAR as a methodology is an effective way to increase citizens' awareness and engagement in self-care, maintain healthy gut microbiota, and prevent NCD development. These interventions are particularly beneficial for individuals at higher risk of developing NCDs.",Garcia S; Ordoñez S; López-Molina VM; Lacruz-Pleguezuelos B; Carrillo de Santa Pau E; Marcos-Zambrano LJ,Gut microbes,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37530428/,0,0,0,0,0,0
37528994,Predictive association of gut microbiome and NLR in anemic low middle-income population of Odisha- a cross-sectional study.,"Iron is abundant on earth but not readily available for colonizing bacteria due to its low solubility in the human body. Hosts and microbiota compete fiercely for iron. <15% Supplemented Iron is absorbed in the small bowel, and the remaining iron is a source of dysbiosis. The gut microbiome signatures to the level of predicting anemia among low-middle-income populations are unknown. The present study was conducted to identify gut microbiome signatures that have predictive potential in association with Neutrophil to lymphocytes ratio (NLR) and Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in anemia. One hundred and four participants between 10 and 70 years were recruited from Odisha's Low Middle-Income (LMI) rural population. Hematological parameters such as Hemoglobin (HGB), NLR, and MCV were measured, and NLR was categorized using percentiles. The microbiome signatures were analyzed from 61 anemic and 43 non-anemic participants using 16 s rRNA sequencing, followed by the Bioinformatics analysis performed to identify the diversity, correlations, and indicator species. The Multi-Layered Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN) model were applied to predict anemia. Significant microbiome diversity among anemic participants was observed between the lower, middle, and upper Quartile NLR groups. For anemic participants with NLR in the lower quartile, alpha indices indicated bacterial overgrowth, and consistently, we identified <i>R. faecis</i> and <i>B. uniformis</i> were predominating. Using ROC analysis, <i>R. faecis</i> had better distinction (AUC = 0.803) to predict anemia with lower NLR. In contrast, <i>E. biforme</i> and <i>H. parainfluenzae</i> were indicators of the NLR in the middle and upper quartile, respectively. While in Non-anemic participants with low MCV, the bacterial alteration was inversely related to gender. Furthermore, our Multi-Layered Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN) models also provided 89% accuracy in predicting Anemic or Non-Anemic from the top 20 OTUs, HGB level, NLR, MCV, and indicator species. These findings strongly associate anemic hematological parameters and microbiome. Such predictive association between the gut microbiome and NLR could be further evaluated and utilized to design precision nutrition models and to predict Iron supplementation and dietary intervention responses in both community and clinical settings.",Venugopal G; Khan ZH; Dash R; Tulsian V; Agrawal S; Rout S; Mahajan P; Ramadass B,Frontiers in nutrition,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37528994/,0,0,0,0,0,0
37493204,"<i>Lactobacillus paracasei</i> ET-22 and derived postbiotics reduce halitosis and modulate oral microbiome dysregulation - a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial.","Oral microbial dysbiosis is the primary etiologic factor for halitosis and may be the critical preventive target for halitosis. This study included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of <i>Lactobacillus paracasei</i> ET-22 live and heat-killed bacteria on halitosis and the related oral microbiome. 68 halitosis subjects were divided into placebo, ET-22 live (ET-22.L) and ET-22 heat-killed (ET-22.HK) groups. Subjects took different lozenges three times a day for 4 weeks and underwent saliva collection and assessment of breath volatile sulfur compound (VSC) levels at the beginning and end of the intervention. Salivary volatile organic compounds were measured using HS-SPME-GC/MS, and the microbiome profile was determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. A positive decrease in breath volatile sulfur compound (VSC) levels was observed in the means of both ET-22.L and ET-22.HK groups after 4 weeks of intervention, being more marked in the ET-22.L group (<i>p</i> = 0.0148). Moreover, ET-22.L and ET-22.HK intervention remarkably changed the composition of total salivary volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and aroma-active VOCs. Key undesirable VOCs, such as indole, pyridine, nonanoic acid, benzothiazole, and valeric acid, were significantly reduced. Meanwhile, ET-22.L or ET-22.HK also altered the taxonomic composition of the salivary microbiome. The halitosis pathogens <i>Rothia</i> and <i>Streptococcus</i> were significantly reduced in the ET-22.HK group and the pathogenic <i>Solobacterium</i> and <i>Peptostreptococcus</i> were significantly inhibited in the ET-22.L group. Collectively, our study suggests that both ET-22.L and ET-22.HK can significantly inhibit the production of undesirable odor compounds in subjects with halitosis, which may be related to the changes of the oral microbiome.",Wuri G; Liu F; Sun Z; Fang B; Zhao W; Hung WL; Liu WH; Zhang X; Wang R; Wu F; Zhao L; Zhang M,Food & function,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37493204/,0,0,0,0,1,0
37492950,"Implications on growth performance, glucose metabolism, PI<sub>3</sub>K/AKT pathway, intestinal flora induced by dietary taurine in a high-carbohydrate diet for grass carp (<i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>).","An 8-week experiment was performed to investigate the influence on growth performance, plasma biochemistry, glucose metabolism and the insulin pathway of supplementation of dietary taurine to a high-carbohydrate diet for grass carp. In this study, fish were fed diets at one of two carbohydrate levels, 31·49 % (positive control) or 38·61 % (T00). The high-carbohydrate basal diet (T00), without taurine, was supplemented with 0·05 % (T05), 0·10 % (T10), 0·15 % (T15) or 0·20 % (T20) taurine, resulting in six isonitrogenous (30·37 %) and isolipidic (2·37 %) experimental diets. The experimental results showed that optimal taurine level improved significantly weight gain, specific growth rate (SGR), feed utilisation, reduced plasma total cholesterol levels, TAG and promoted insulin-like growth factor level. Glucokinase, pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activities showed a quadratic function model with increasing dietary taurine level, while hexokinase, fatty acid synthetase activities exhibited a positive linear trend. Optimal taurine supplementation in high-carbohydrate diet upregulated insulin receptor (<i>Ir</i>), insulin receptor substrate (<i>Irs1</i>), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (<i>pi3k</i>), protein kinase B (<i>akt1</i>), glycogen synthase kinase 3 <i>β</i> (<i>gs3kβ</i>) mRNA level and downregulated insulin-like growth factor (<i>igf-1</i>), insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (<i>igf-1R</i>) and Fork head transcription factor 1 (<i>foxo1</i>) mRNA level. The above results suggested that optimal taurine level could improve growth performance, hepatic capacity for glycolipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity, thus enhancing the utilisation of carbohydrates in grass carp.

37457834,Dietary fiber modulates gut microbiome and metabolome in a host sex-specific manner in a murine model of aging.,"Emerging evidence reveals the fundamental role of the gut microbiome in human health. Among various factors regulating our gut microbiome, diet is one of the most indispensable and prominent one. Inulin is one of the most widely-studied dietary fiber for its beneficial prebiotic effects by positively modulating the gut microbiome and microbial metabolites. Recent research underscores sexual dimorphism and sex-specific disparities in microbiome and also diet-microbiome interactions. However, whether and how the prebiotic effects of dietary fiber differ among sexes remain underexplored. To this end, we herein examine sex-specific differences in the prebiotic effects of inulin on gut microbiome and metabolome in a humanized murine model of aging i.e., aged mice carrying human fecal microbiota. The findings demonstrate that inulin exerts prebiotic effects, but in a sex-dependent manner. Overall, inulin increases the proportion of <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Blautia,</i> and glycine, while decreasing <i>Eggerthella</i>, <i>Lactococcus</i>, <i>Streptococcus</i>, trimethylamine, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate, leucine and methionine in both sexes. However, we note sex-specific effects of inulin including suppression of <i>f</i>_<i>Enteroccaceae:_</i>, <i>Odoribacter</i>, bile acids, malonate, thymine, valine, acetoin, and ethanol while promotion of <i>Dubosiella</i>, pyruvate, and glycine in males. Whereas, suppression of <i>Faecalibaculum, Lachnoclostridium, Schaedlerella,</i> phenylalanine and enhancement of <i>Parasutterella, Phocaeicola, f_Lachnospiraceae;_, Barnesiella, Butyricimonas</i>, glycine, propionate, acetate and glutamate are observed in females. Altogether, the study reveals that prebiotic mechanisms of dietary fiber vary in a sex-dependent manner, underscoring the importance of including both sexes in preclinical/clinical studies to comprehend the mechanisms and functional aspects of dietary interventions for effective extrapolation and translation in precision nutrition milieus.",Kadyan S; Park G; Wang B; Nagpal R,Frontiers in molecular biosciences,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37457834/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Due to its diverse and complex causes, there is no cure at present, and researchers are constantly exploring new therapies. In recent years, nano-selenium particle(SeNP) has attracted wide attention due to excellent biological activities. Therefore, in this study, for the first time, we used a natural polysaccharide, Eucommia ulmoides polysaccharide (EUP), modified SeNP to get EUP-SeNP with a size of about 170 nm, and its effect on 3% dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) induced colitis was explored. Our results showed that colon intestinal histology, intestinal mucosal barrier, inflammatory cytokines and intestinal microbiome composition were changed after EUP-SeNP treatment in colitis mice. Specifically, it was also shown that oral treatment of EUP-SeNP could relieve the degree of DSS-induced colitis in mice by restoring weight loss, reducing disease activity index (DAI), enhancing colon antioxidant capacity and regulating intestinal microbiome composition. In addition, we verified the mechanism in intestinal epithelial cell lines, showing that EUP-SeNP inhibited LPS-induced activation of the TRL-4/NF-κB signaling pathway in intestinal epithelial cell lines. To some extend, our study provides therapeutic reference for the treatment of IBD.",Ye R; Guo Q; Huang J; Wang Z; Chen Y; Dong Y,Journal of nanobiotechnology,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37438752/,0,0,0,0,0,0
37388163,"Sodium butyrate promotes gastrointestinal development of preweaning bull calves via inhibiting inflammation, balancing nutrient metabolism, and optimizing microbial community functions.","Butyrate promotes the growth and gastrointestinal development of calves. But, the mechanisms behind its effects on signaling pathways of the gastrointestinal tract and rumen microbiome is unclear. This study aimed to reveal transcriptomic pathways of gastrointestinal epithelium and microbial community in response to butyrate supplementation in calves fed a high fiber starter. Fourteen Holstein bull calves (39.9 ± 3.7 kg, 14 d of age) were assigned to 2 groups (sodium butyrate group, SB; control group, Ctrl). The SB group received 0.5% SB supplementation. At d 51, the calves were slaughtered to obtain samples for analysis of the transcriptome of the rumen and jejunum epithelium as well as ruminal microbial metagenome. Sodium butyrate supplementation resulted in a higher performance in average daily gain and development of jejunum and rumen papillae. In both the rumen and jejunum epithelium, SB down-regulated pathways related to inflammation including NF-κB (<i>PPKCB, CXCL8, CXCL12</i>), interleukin-17 (<i>IL17A, IL17B, MMP9</i>), and chemokine (<i>CXCL12, CCL4, CCL8</i>) and up-regulated immune pathways including the intestinal immune network for immunoglobulin A (IgA) production (<i>CD28</i>). Meanwhile, in the jejunum epithelium, SB regulated pathways related to nutritional metabolism including nitrogen metabolism (<i>CA1, CA2, CA3</i>), synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies (<i>HMGCS2, BDH1</i>, <i>LOC100295719</i>), fat digestion and absorption (<i>PLA2G2F, APOA1, APOA4</i>), and the PPAR signaling pathway (<i>FABP4, FABP6, CYP4A11</i>). The metagenome showed that SB greatly increased the relative abundance of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> and <i>Eubacterium limosum</i>, activated ruminal microbial carbohydrate metabolism pathways and increased the abundance of carbohydrate hydrolysis enzymes. In conclusion, butyrate exhibited promoting effects on growth and gastrointestinal development by inhibiting inflammation, enhancing immunity and energy harvesting, and activating microbial carbohydrate metabolism.

37343920,Chronic exposure to UVB induces nephritis and gut microbiota dysbiosis in mice based on the integration of renal transcriptome profiles and 16S rRNA sequencing data.,"Ultraviolet (UV) is a common and abundant environmental factor that affects daily life. Although the effects of UV radiation on the skin have been extensively reported, studies on the influence of UV radiation on internal organs are still limited. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of UVB exposure on the kidney of mice and to investigate the possible mechanism. In the present study, histopathology changes, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response were used to evaluate the kidney and colon injury induced by UVB exposure. The results showed that the 14-week chronic skin exposure to UVB triggers a kidney injury response characterized by macrophage infiltration, elevated oxidative stress as well as inflammatory and injury markers. The RNA sequencing demonstrated that chronic UVB exposure could alter the kidney transcriptomic profile distinguished by the regulation of genes involved in the Notch signaling pathway, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and ECM-receptor interaction. Besides, chronic UVB exposure also resulted in gut dysbiosis, manifested as colon macrophage infiltration, stimulated inflammatory responses, impaired barrier integrity, and microbiota structural and functional disorders. The Spearman analysis results further revealed a strong correlation between gut microbiota and kidney injury. In conclusion, skin chronic exposure to UVB causes nephritis and gut microbiota dysbiosis in mice, and these findings provide new insight into the underlying risks of chronic UVB exposure to human wellness.",Geng R; Fang J; Kang SG; Huang K; Tong T,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37343920/,0,0,0,0,0,0

In this study, a cholesterol-lowering bacterium, Lactobacillus gasseri TF08-1, was isolated from the feces of a healthy adolescent, and its probiotic potentials were evaluated through genomic mining and in vitro test. The assembled draft genome comprised of 1,974,590 bp and was predicted total of 1,940 CDSs. The annotation of the genome revealed that L. gasseri TF08-1 harbored abundant categories of functional genes in metabolic and information processing. Moreover, strain TF08-1 has capacity to utilize D-Glucose, Sucrose, D-Maltose, Salicin, D-Xylose, D-Cellobiose, D-Mannose, and D-Trehalose, as the carbon source. The safety assessment showed strain TF08-1 contained few antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factors and was only resistant to 2 antibiotics detected by antimicrobial susceptibility test. A high bile salt hydrolase activity was found and a cholesterol-reducing effect was determined in vitro, which the result showed a remarkable cholesterol removal capability of L. gasseri TF08-1 with an efficiency of 84.40 %.

37317157,Toxicity and Impact of Silica Nanoparticles on the Configuration of Gut Microbiota in Immunodeficient Mice.,"Nanoparticles (NPs), having exceptional physicochemical and electrical characteristics with lower toxicity, have evolved as dynamic drug delivery carriers in living organisms. Potentially, the intragastric gavage of silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) affects gut microbiota profiles in immunodeficient mice. In this study, the impact of SiNPs of variable size and dosage was investigated in cyclophosphamide (Cy)-induced immunodeficient mice, specifically on their immune functions and gut microbiota, through physicochemical and metagenomic analysis. SiNPs of different sizes and doses were gavaged to Cy-induced immunodeficient mice for 12 days at an interval of 24 h to investigate their effects on immunological functions and the gut microbiome of mice. Our results showed that SiNPs had no significant toxicological effects on the cellular and hematological activities of immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, after the administration of different levels of SiNPs, no immune dysfunction was found in the immunosuppressed mice groups. However, gut-microbial studies and comparisons of characteristic bacterial diversity and compositions demonstrated that SiNPs significantly affect the abundance of different bacterial communities. LEfSe analysis revealed that SiNPs significantly increased the abundance of <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Sphingomonas</i>, <i>Sutterella</i>, <i>Akkermansia</i>, and <i>Prevotella</i>, and potentially reduced <i>Ruminococcus</i> and <i>Allobaculum</i>. Thus, SiNPs significantly regulate and modify the configuration of the gut microbiota in immunodeficient mice. These dynamic variations in the intestinal bacterial community, abundance, and diversity provide new insight into the regulation and administration of silica-based NPs. This would be helpful for the further demonstration of the mechanism of action and prediction of the potential effects of SiNPs.",Shabbir S; Hu Y; He X; Huang K; Xu W,Microorganisms,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37317157/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Principal component analysis was used to select blueberry genotypes that varied in anthocyanin profiles. Total phenolic content did not predict the bioavailability of polyphenolic compounds in rats. A range in bioavailability was observed in individual polyphenolic compounds across genotypes. Both alpha and beta diversity analyses indicated that gut microbiome profiles varied with blueberry dose in rats.

37181156,Supplementation with inulin-type fructans affects gut microbiota and attenuates some of the cardiometabolic benefits of a plant-based diet in individuals with overweight or obesity.,"The gut microbiota has emerged as a potential therapeutic target to improve the management of obesity and its comorbidities. We investigated the impact of a high fiber (∼38 g/d) plant-based diet, consumed <i>ad libitum</i>, with or without added inulin-type fructans (ITF), on the gut microbiota composition and cardiometabolic outcomes in subjects with obesity. We also tested if baseline <i>Prevotella/Bacteroides</i> (P/B) ratio predicts weight loss outcomes. This is a secondary exploratory analysis from the PREVENTOMICS study, in which 100 subjects (82 completers) aged 18-65 years with body mass index 27-40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were randomized to 10 weeks of double-blinded treatment with a personalized or a generic plant-based diet. Changes from baseline to end-of-trial in gut microbiota composition (16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing), body composition, cardiometabolic health and inflammatory markers were evaluated in the whole cohort (<i>n</i> = 82), and also compared in the subgroup of subjects who were supplemented with an additional 20 g/d ITF-prebiotics (<i>n</i> = 21) or their controls (<i>n</i> = 22). In response to the plant-based diet, all subjects lost weight (-3.2 [95% CI -3.9, -2.5] kg) and experienced significant improvements in body composition and cardiometabolic health indices. Addition of ITF to the plant-based diet reduced microbial diversity (Shannon index) and selectively increased <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and <i>Faecalibacterium</i> (<i>q</i> < 0.05). The change in the latter was significantly associated with higher values of insulin and HOMA-IR and lower HDL cholesterol. In addition, the LDL:HDL ratio and the concentrations of IL-10, MCP-1 and TNFα were significantly elevated in the ITF-subgroup. There was no relationship between baseline P/B ratio and changes in body weight (<i>r</i> = -0.07, <i>p</i> = 0.53). A plant-based diet consumed <i>ad libitum</i> modestly decreases body weight and has multiple health benefits in individuals with obesity. Addition of ITF-prebiotics on top this naturally fiber-rich background selectively changes gut microbiota composition and attenuates some of the realized cardiometabolic benefits.

37137684,Gut microbiome modulates the effects of a personalised postprandial-targeting (PPT) diet on cardiometabolic markers: a diet intervention in pre-diabetes.,"To explore the interplay between dietary modifications, microbiome composition and host metabolic responses in a dietary intervention setting of a personalised postprandial-targeting (PPT) diet versus a Mediterranean (MED) diet in pre-diabetes. In a 6-month dietary intervention, adults with pre-diabetes were randomly assigned to follow an MED or PPT diet (based on a machine-learning algorithm for predicting postprandial glucose responses). Data collected at baseline and 6 months from 200 participants who completed the intervention included: dietary data from self-recorded logging using a smartphone application, gut microbiome data from shotgun metagenomics sequencing of faecal samples, and clinical data from continuous glucose monitoring, blood biomarkers and anthropometrics. PPT diet induced more prominent changes to the gut microbiome composition, compared with MED diet, consistent with overall greater dietary modifications observed. Particularly, microbiome alpha-diversity increased significantly in PPT (p=0.007) but not in MED arm (p=0.18). Post hoc analysis of changes in multiple dietary features, including food-categories, nutrients and PPT-adherence score across the cohort, demonstrated significant associations between specific dietary changes and species-level changes in microbiome composition. Furthermore, using causal mediation analysis we detect nine microbial species that partially mediate the association between specific dietary changes and clinical outcomes, including three species (from <i>Bacteroidales</i>, <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>, <i>Oscillospirales</i> orders) that mediate the association between PPT-adherence score and clinical outcomes of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides. Finally, using machine-learning models trained on dietary changes and baseline clinical data, we predict personalised metabolic responses to dietary modifications and assess features importance for clinical improvement in cardiometabolic markers of blood lipids, glycaemic control and body weight. Our findings support the role of gut microbiome in modulating the effects of dietary modifications on cardiometabolic outcomes, and advance the concept of precision nutrition strategies for reducing comorbidities in pre-diabetes.

37108354,Flavonoids in <i>Amomum tsaoko</i> Crevost et Lemarie Ameliorate Loperamide-Induced Constipation in Mice by Regulating Gut Microbiota and Related Metabolites.,"<i>Amomum tsaoko</i> (AT) is a dietary botanical with laxative properties; however, the active ingredients and mechanisms are still unclear. The active fraction of AT aqueous extract (ATAE) for promoting defecation in slow transit constipation mice is the ethanol-soluble part (ATES). The total flavonoids of ATES (ATTF) were the main active component. ATTF significantly increased the abundance of <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bacillus</i> and reduced the dominant commensals, such as Lachnospiraceae, thereby changing the gut microbiota structure and composition. Meanwhile, ATTF changed the gut metabolites mainly enriched in pathways such as the serotonergic synapse. In addition, ATTF increased the serum serotonin (5-HT) content and mRNA expression of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A (<i>5-HT<sub>2A</sub></i>), Phospholipase A2 (<i>PLA2</i>), and Cyclooxygenase-2 (<i>COX2</i>), which are involved in the serotonergic synaptic pathway. ATTF increased Transient receptor potential A1 (<i>TRPA1</i>), which promotes the release of 5-HT, and Myosin light chain 3(<i>MLC3</i>), which promotes smooth muscle motility. Notably, we established a network between gut microbiota, gut metabolites, and host parameters. The dominant gut microbiota <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bacillus</i>, prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2) and laxative phenotypes showed the most significant associations. The above results suggest that ATTF may relieve constipation by regulating the gut microbiota and serotonergic synaptic pathway and has great potential for laxative drug development in the future.",Hu Y; Gao X; Zhao Y; Liu S; Luo K; Fu X; Li J; Sheng J; Tian Y; Fan Y,International journal of molecular sciences,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37108354/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Moving away from the conventional 'one size fits all', such targeted intervention approaches may pave the way to better population health, including lower burden of non-communicable diseases. To date, most personalised and precision nutrition approaches have been focussed on tackling obesity and cardiometabolic diseases with limited efforts directed to cancer prevention and for cancer survivors. Advances in understanding the biological basis of cancer and of the role played by diet in cancer prevention and in survival after cancer diagnosis, mean that it is timely to test and to apply such personalised and precision nutrition approaches in the cancer area. This endeavour can take advantage of the enhanced understanding of interactions between dietary factors, individual genotype and the gut microbiome that impact on risk of, and survival after, cancer diagnosis.

Factors predicting the response to RS are not yet established and would be useful for developing precision nutrition approaches that maximize the benefits of dietary fiber intake. We sought to identify predictors of gut microbiota response to RS supplementation. We enrolled 76 healthy adults into a seven-week crossover study. Participants consumed RS type 2 (RS2), RS type 4 (RS4), and a digestible starch, for ten days each with five-day washout periods in between. We collected fecal and saliva samples and food records before and during each treatment period. We performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing and measured fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), salivary amylase gene copy number, and salivary amylase activity (SAA). Dietary fiber intake was predictive of relative abundance of several amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) at the end of both RS treatments. Treatment order (the order of consumption of RS2 and RS4), alpha diversity, and a subset of ASVs were predictive of SCFA changes after RS supplementation. SAA was only predictive of the relative abundance of ASVs after digestible starch supplementation. Based on our findings, dietary fiber intake and gut microbiome composition would be informative if assessed prior to recommending RS supplementation. Using a precision nutrition approach to optimize the benefits of dietary fibers such as RS could be an effective strategy to compensate for the low consumption of dietary fiber nationwide.",Devarakonda SLS; Superdock DK; Ren J; Johnson LM; Loinard-Gonz Lez AAP; Poole AC,medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37034622/,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, the role of glycosylation in modulation of the weaned porcine gut AP functionality is unclear. Herein three different research approaches were taken to investigate how deglycosylation affected weaned porcine gut AP activity kinetics. In the first approach, weaned porcine jejunal AP isoform (IAP) was fractionated by the fast protein-liquid chromatography and purified IAP fractions were kinetically characterized to be the higher-affinity and lower-capacity glycosylated mature IAP (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in comparison with the lower-affinity and higher-capacity non-glycosylated pre-mature IAP. The second approach enzyme activity kinetic analyses showed that <i>N</i>-deglycosylation of AP by the peptide <i>N</i>-glycosidase-F enzyme reduced (<i>p</i> < 0.05) the IAP maximal activity in the jejunum and ileum and decreased AP affinity (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in the large intestine. In the third approach, the porcine IAP isoform-X1 (IAPX1) gene was overexpressed in the prokaryotic ClearColiBL21 (DE3) cell and the recombinant porcine IAPX1 was associated with reduced (<i>p</i> < 0.05) enzyme affinity and maximal enzyme activity. Therefore, levels of glycosylation can modulate plasticity of weaned porcine gut AP functionality towards maintaining gut microbiome and the whole-body physiological status.",Yin X; Wang W; Seah SYK; Mine Y; Fan MZ,"Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36986329/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36986043,Application of Computational Data Modeling to a Large-Scale Population Cohort Assists the Discovery of Inositol as a Strain-Specific Substrate for <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i>.,"<i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i> (<i>F. prausnitzii</i>) is a bacterial taxon in the human gut with anti-inflammatory properties, and this may contribute to the beneficial effects of healthy eating habits. However, little is known about the nutrients that enhance the growth of <i>F. prausnitzii</i> other than simple sugars and fibers. Here, we combined dietary and microbiome data from the American Gut Project (AGP) to identify nutrients that may be linked to the relative abundance of <i>F. prausnitzii</i>. Using a machine learning approach in combination with univariate analyses, we identified that sugar alcohols, carbocyclic sugar, and vitamins may contribute to <i>F. prausnitzii</i> growth. We next explored the effects of these nutrients on the growth of two <i>F. prausnitzii</i> strains in vitro and observed robust and strain-dependent growth patterns on sorbitol and inositol, respectively. In the context of a complex community using in vitro fermentation, neither inositol alone nor in combinations with vitamin B exerted a significant growth-promoting effect on <i>F. prausnitzii,</i> partly due to high variability among the fecal microbiota community from four healthy donors. However, the fecal communities that showed an increase in <i>F. prausnitzii</i> on inulin also responded with at least 60% more <i>F. prausnitzii</i> on any of inositol containing media than control. Future nutritional studies aiming to increase the relative abundance of <i>F. prausnitzii</i> should explore a personalized approach accounting for strain-level genetic variations and community-level microbiome composition.",Dogra SK; Dardinier A; Mainardi F; Siegwald L; Bartova S; Le Roy C; Chou CJ,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36986043/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36918961,NEMoE: a nutrition aware regularized mixture of experts model to identify heterogeneous diet-microbiome-host health interactions.,"Unrevealing the interplay between diet, the microbiome, and the health state could enable the design of personalized intervention strategies and improve the health and well-being of individuals. A common approach to this is to divide the study population into smaller cohorts based on dietary preferences in the hope of identifying specific microbial signatures. However, classification of patients based solely on diet is unlikely to reflect the microbiome-host health relationship or the taxonomic microbiome makeup. We present a novel approach, the Nutrition-Ecotype Mixture of Experts (NEMoE) model, for establishing associations between gut microbiota and health state that accounts for diet-specific cohort variability using a regularized mixture of experts model framework with an integrated parameter sharing strategy to ensure data-driven diet-cohort identification consistency across taxonomic levels. The success of our approach was demonstrated through a series of simulation studies, in which NEMoE showed robustness with regard to parameter selection and varying degrees of data heterogeneity. Further application to real-world microbiome data from a Parkinson's disease cohort revealed that NEMoE is capable of not only improving predictive performance for Parkinson's Disease but also for identifying diet-specific microbial signatures of disease. In summary, NEMoE can be used to uncover diet-specific relationships between nutritional-ecotype and patient health and to contextualize precision nutrition for different diseases.

36909644,Microbial community-scale metabolic modeling predicts personalized short chain fatty acid production profiles in the human gut.,"Microbially-derived short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the human gut are tightly coupled to host metabolism, immune regulation, and integrity of the intestinal epithelium. However, the production of SCFAs can vary widely between individuals consuming the same diet, with lower levels often associated with disease. A systems-scale mechanistic understanding of this heterogeneity is lacking. We present a microbial community-scale metabolic modeling (MCMM) approach to predict individual-specific SCFA production profiles. We assess the quantitative accuracy of our MCMMs using <i>in vitro</i>, <i>ex vivo</i>, and <i>in vivo</i> data. Next, we show how MCMM SCFA predictions are significantly associated with blood-derived clinical chemistries, including cardiometabolic and immunological health markers, across a large human cohort. Finally, we demonstrate how MCMMs can be leveraged to design personalized dietary, prebiotic, and probiotic interventions that optimize SCFA production in the gut.

36768394,Trimethylamine N-Oxide Response to a Mixed Macronutrient Tolerance Test in a Cohort of Healthy United States Adults.,"Plasma trimethylamine n-oxide (TMAO) concentration increases in responses to feeding TMAO, choline, phosphatidylcholine, L-carnitine, and betaine but it is unknown whether concentrations change following a mixed macronutrient tolerance test (MMTT) with limited amounts of TMAO precursors. In this proof-of-concept study, we provided healthy female and male adults (<i>n</i> = 97) ranging in age (18-65 years) and BMI (18-44 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) a MMTT (60% fat, 25% sucrose; 42% of a standard 2000 kilo calorie diet) and recorded their metabolic response at fasting and at 30 min, 3 h, and 6 h postprandially. We quantified total exposure to TMAO (AUC-TMAO) and classified individuals by the blood draw at which they experienced their maximal TMAO concentration (TMAO-response groups). We related AUC-TMAO to the 16S rRNA microbiome, to two SNPs in the exons of the <i>FMO3</i> gene (rs2266782, G>A, p.Glu158Lys; and rs2266780, A>G, p.Glu308Gly), and to a priori plasma metabolites. We observed varying TMAO responses (timing and magnitude) and identified a sex by age interaction such that AUC-TMAO increased with age in females but not in males (<i>p</i>-value = 0.0112). Few relationships between AUC-TMAO and the fecal microbiome and <i>FMO3</i> genotype were identified. We observed a strong correlation between AUC-TMAO and TNF-α that depended on TMAO-response group. These findings promote precision nutrition and have important ramifications for the eating behavior of adults who could benefit from reducing TMAO exposure, and for understanding factors that generate plasma TMAO.",James KL; Gertz ER; Kirschke CP; Allayee H; Huang L; Kable ME; Newman JW; Stephensen CB; Bennett BJ,International journal of molecular sciences,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36768394/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36737776,5-HT attenuates chronic stress-induced cognitive impairment in mice through intestinal flora disruption.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis plays an important role in the development of depression. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 5-HT on cognitive function, learning and memory induced by chronic unforeseeable mild stress stimulation (CUMS) in female mice. CUMS mice and TPH2 KO mice were used in the study. Lactococcus lactis E001-B-8 fungus powder was orally administered to mice with CUMS. We used the open field test, Morris water maze, tail suspension test and sucrose preference test to examine learning-related behaviours. In addition, AB-PAS staining, immunofluorescence, ELISA, qPCR, Western blotting and microbial sequencing were employed to address our hypotheses. The effect of CUMS was more obvious in female mice than in male mice. Compared with female CUMS mice, extracellular serotonin levels in TPH2 KO CUMS mice were significantly reduced, and cognitive dysfunction was aggravated. Increased hippocampal autophagy levels, decreased neurotransmitter levels, reduced oxidative stress damage, increased neuroinflammatory responses and disrupted gut flora were observed. Moreover, L. lactis E001-B-8 significantly improved the cognitive behaviour of mice. These results strongly suggest that L. lactis E001-B-8 but not FLX can alleviate rodent depressive and anxiety-like behaviours in response to CUMS, which is associated with the improvement of 5-HT metabolism and modulation of the gut microbiome composition.",Ma J; Wang R; Chen Y; Wang Z; Dong Y,Journal of neuroinflammation,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36737776/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36723265,Both live and heat-killed <i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i> J-12 alleviated oral ulcers in LVG golden Syrian hamsters by gavage by directly intervening in the intestinal flora structure.,"Live and heat-killed <i>Bifidobacterium</i> has been proven to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In this study, we evaluated the effects of live and heat-killed <i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i> J-12 (J-12) on the oral ulceration of LVG golden Syrian hamsters after buccal membrane injection with methyl viologen dichloride. Results showed that interleukin-1β, glutathione, and malondialdehyde in serum were downregulated by the gavage of live and heat-killed J-12 bacteria. The J-12 live and heat-killed bacteria can reduce the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 by reducing the expression of nuclear factor kappa-B, thus reducing the expression of anti-inflammatory factors lipoxin A4 and prostaglandin E2. Reducing the expression of caspase-3 and adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase resulted in a reduction of ulcer tissue DNA damage. In addition, regulating the structure of the intestinal flora prevented the process of oral ulcer formation. This study shows that J-12 can reduce the risk of oral ulcer formation while also having a positive effect on inhibiting existing oral ulcer growth.",Jing N; Liu F; Wang R; Zhang Y; Yang J; Hou Y; Zhang H; Xie Y; Liu H; Ge S; Jin J,Food & function,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36723265/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36719201,Disruption of the Intestinal Mucosal Barrier Induced by High Fructose and Restraint Stress Is Regulated by the Intestinal Microbiota and Microbiota Metabolites.,"Environmental (restraint stress) and dietary (high fructose) factors are key triggers for flares of inflammatory bowel disease; however, the mechanisms involved in this phenomenon are not fully elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms by which restraint stress and high fructose damage the intestinal mucosal immune barrier. The feces of C57BL/6J mice were subjected to 16S rRNA and untargeted metabolome sequencing, and the intestinal histological structure was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining. The mRNA and protein levels of the intestinal protein were analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), Western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The metabolites of the microbiota were tested <i>in vitro</i>, and Akkermansia muciniphila was used for colonization <i>in vivo</i>. Dietary fructose exacerbated the development of restraint stress, with an extensive change in the composition of the gut microbiota and microbial metabolites. The disturbance of the microbiota composition led to an increase in the abundance of histamine and a decrease in the abundance of taurine, which inhibited the expression of tight junction and MUC2 proteins, destroyed the function of NLRP6, and reduced intestinal autophagy level; this in turn disrupted the function of colonic goblet cells to secrete mucus, leading to defects in the intestinal mucosal barrier, which ultimately codrives colon autoinflammation. However, <i>A. muciniphila</i> supplementation counteracted damage to the intestinal mucosal barrier by high fructose and restraint stress. Therefore, the gut microbiota and microbiota metabolites play an important role in maintaining microenvironment homeostasis of the intestinal mucosal barrier. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> A high-fructose diet aggravated restraint stress-induced changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiome, in which the abundance of <i>A. muciniphila</i> was significantly increased. The high-fructose diet exacerbated restraint stress-induced the changes in the composition of the microbial metabolites, with taurine abundance being downregulated and histamine abundance upregulated. High fructose and restraint stress induced colonic mucosal immune barrier damage, possibly due to changes in the abundance of the microbial metabolites taurine and histamine. Colonization with <i>A. muciniphila</i> stimulated the expression of the NLRP6 inflammasome and activated autophagy in goblet cells, thereby producing more new mucins, which could protect the intestinal mucosal barrier.",Yu J; Liu T; Guo Q; Wang Z; Chen Y; Dong Y,Microbiology spectrum,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36719201/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36532422,Fecal microbiota transplantation restores normal fecal composition and delays malignant development of mild chronic kidney disease in rats.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis, but the role of intestinal flora in CKD treatment remains to be elucidated. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can be utilized to re-establish healthy gut microbiota for a variety of diseases, which offers new insight for treating CKD. First, 5/6 nephrectomy rats (Donor CKD) and sham rats (Donor Sham) were used as donors for FMT, and fecal metagenome were analyzed to explore potential therapeutic targets. Then, to assess the effect of FMT on CKD, sterilized 1/2 nephrectomy rats were transplanted with fecal microbiota from Donor sham (CKD/Sham) or Donor CKD (CKD/CKD) rats, and 1/2 nephrectomy rats without FMT (CKD) or no nephrectomy (Sham) were used as model control or normal control. Results showed that <i>Bacteroides uniformis</i> and <i>Anaerotruncus</i> sp. <i>1XD22-93</i> were enriched in Donor CKD, while <i>Lactobacillus johnsonii</i> and <i>Lactobacillus intestinalis</i> were reduced. In addition, the increased abundance of microbial functions included tryptophan metabolism and lysine degradation contributing to the accumulation of protein-bound uremic toxins (PBUTs) in Donor CKD. Genome analysis indicated that FMT successfully differentiated groups of gut microbes and altered specific gut microbiota after 1 week of treatment, with <i>Bacteroides uniformis</i> and <i>Anaerotruncus</i> sp. <i>1XD22-93</i> increasing in CKD/CKD group as well as <i>Lactobacillus johnsonii</i> and <i>Lactobacillus intestinalis</i> being improved in CKD/Sham group. In comparison to CKD group, substantial PBUT buildup and renal damage were observed in CKD/CKD. Interestingly, compared to CKD or CKD/CKD group, tryptophan metabolism and lysine degradation were efficiently suppressed in CKD/Sham group, while lysine biosynthesis was promoted. Therefore, FMT considerably reduced PBUTs accumulation. After FMT, PBUTs and renal function in CKD/Sham rats remained the same as in Sham group throughout the experimental period. In summary, FMT could delay the malignant development of CKD by modifying microbial amino acid metabolism through altering the microenvironment of intestinal flora, thereby providing a novel potential approach for treating CKD.",Liu X; Zhang M; Wang X; Liu P; Wang L; Li Y; Wang X; Ren F,Frontiers in microbiology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36532422/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36398862,Reproducible changes in the anorexia nervosa gut microbiota following inpatient therapy remain distinct from non-eating disorder controls.,"The composition of the gut microbiota in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN), and the ability of this microbial community to influence the host, remains uncertain. To achieve a broader understanding of the role of the intestinal microbiota in patients with AN, we collected fecal samples before and following clinical treatment at two geographically distinct eating disorder units (Center of Excellence for Eating Disorders [UNC-CH] and ACUTE Center for Eating Disorders [Denver Health]). Gut microbiotas were characterized in patients with AN, before and after inpatient treatment, and in non-eating disorder (non-ED) controls using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. The impact of inpatient treatment on the AN gut microbiota was remarkably consistent between eating disorder units. Although weight in patients with AN showed improvements, AN microbiotas post-treatment remained distinct from non-ED controls. Additionally, AN gut microbiotas prior to treatment exhibited more fermentation pathways and a lower ability to degrade carbohydrates than non-ED controls. As the intestinal microbiota can influence nutrient metabolism, our data highlight the complex microbial communities in patients with AN as an element needing further attention post inpatient treatment. Additionally, this study defines the effects of renourishment on the AN gut microbiota and serves as a platform to develop precision nutrition approaches to potentially mitigate impediments to recovery.",Fouladi F; Bulik-Sullivan EC; Glenny EM; Thornton LM; Reed KK; Thomas S; Kleiman S; Watters A; Oakes J; Huh EY; Tang Q; Liu J; Djukic Z; Harper L; Trillo-Ordoñez Y; Sun S; Blakely I; Mehler PS; Fodor AA; Tarantino LM; Bulik CM; Carroll IM,Gut microbes,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36398862/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36275652,"Effects of dietary <i>Clostridium autoethanogenum</i> protein on the growth, disease resistance, intestinal digestion, immunity and microbiota structure of <i>Litopenaeus vannamei</i> reared at different water salinities.","The shortage of fishmeal (FM) resources limits the healthy development of aquaculture. Developing new protein sources to replace FM in aquatic feeds is an effective measure to alleviate this situation. However, the application effect of new protein sources is greatly affected by water salinity, which is an important parameter of aquaculture. In this study, the growth, disease resistance, and intestinal digestion, immunity, and microbiota structure of <i>Litopenaeus vannamei</i> (initial weight: 0.38 ± 0.01 g) fed on <i>Clostridium autoethanogenum</i> protein (CAP) or not at three different water salinities (15 ‰, 30 ‰, and 45 ‰) were compared, aiming to explore the effects of dietary CAP on shrimp when suffering different salinity stresses. The results showed that the growth performance, feed utilization, and survival rate (SR) after pathogen challenge of <i>L. vannamei</i> could be significantly improved by dietary CAP when compared with the control at the same salinity and they were also significantly affected by salinity changes when <i>L. vannamei</i> was fed on the same protein source. With the increase in salinity, obvious upregulation was observed in the activities and gene expression of digestive enzymes both in <i>L. vannamei</i> fed on FM and CAP, with significantly higher levels in <i>L. vannamei</i> fed on CAP than in those fed on FM at the same salinity. Meanwhile, the expression levels of immune genes in the CAP group were significantly higher than those in the FM group at different salinities. The intestinal microbiota analysis showed that CAP could increase the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria and decrease the relative abundance of harmful bacteria in the intestine of <i>L. vannamei</i> at the phylum, family, and genus levels, and it was more affected by salinity changes when compared with FM. Besides, the changes in salinity and protein sources led to different changes in the intestinal microflora function of <i>L. vannamei</i>. In sum, this study indicated that CAP could improve the growth, disease resistance, digestive capacity, and intestinal microflora of <i>L. vannamei</i> with a much more intense immune response and enhance its ability to cope with salinity stress.",Chen J; Wang H; Yuan H; Hu N; Zou F; Li C; Shi L; Tan B; Zhang S,Frontiers in immunology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36275652/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36211488,Modulation of gut microbiota: The effects of a fruits and vegetables supplement.,"The consumption of an optimal amount of fruits and vegetables is known to improve physical fitness and physiological body functions. Healthy eating habits, including intake of fruits and vegetables, can modify gut microbiota. This study aimed to demonstrate the effectiveness of a formulated fruit and vegetable supplement (FVS) in modulating the antioxidant capacity and the gut microbiota composition. We enrolled 30 healthy volunteer subjects, matched for age, gender, BMI, and smoking habits, and randomized them into the FVS and the placebo (PLA) groups. Among the serum vitamins, the folic acid level was significantly higher (<i>p</i> = 0.001) in the FVS group than in the PLA group, whereas the vitamin B2 level was significantly higher in the PLA group than in the FVS group (<i>p</i> = 0.028). The antioxidant capacity, measured by using the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) method, was also slightly higher in the FVS group than in the PLA group but did not reach statistical significance. The dietary intake, assessed by 24-h recalls, did not show any significant changes after the supplementation in both the groups. The gut microbiome composition, measured by 16S rDNA sequencing, showed no difference in both alpha and beta diversities, whereas the LEfse analysis revealed a microbial shift after the treatment, with a decreased abundance of the genus <i>Ruminococcus</i> from the Lachnospiraceae family (<i>p</i> = 0.009), and the unclassified genus from the family Erysipelotrichaceae (UC36, <i>p</i> = 0.003) in the FVS group compared with the PLA group (confirmed by SIAMCAT analysis, AUC = 74.1%). With a minor effect, the genus <i>Faecalibacterium</i> and unclassified genus and family from the order Lactobacillales (UC31) were also increased in the FVS group compared with the PLA group (<i>p</i> = 0.0474, <i>p</i> = 0.0352, respectively). SCFA measurement by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry showed an increased level of 2-methylbutyrate in the FVS group compared with the PLA group (<i>p</i> = 0.0385). Finally, the Spearman correlation analysis showed that in the FVS group, the genus <i>Faecalibacterium</i> positively correlated with 2-methyl butyrate (<i>p</i> = 0.040). In the PLA group, none of the significant bacteria correlated with either SCFA or serum biomarkers. The network analysis confirmed the positive correlation between genus <i>Faecalibacterium</i> and 2-methyl butyrate. We can conclude that the FVS in healthy individuals modified the gut microbiota composition and metabolites, and it can potentially contribute to reduce the pro-inflammatory response along with the antioxidant capacity.",Lakshmanan AP; Mingione A; Pivari F; Dogliotti E; Brasacchio C; Murugesan S; Cusi D; Lazzaroni M; Soldati L; Terranegra A,Frontiers in nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36211488/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36189245,Integrated analysis of intestinal microbiota and metabolomic reveals that decapod iridescent virus 1 (DIV1) infection induces secondary bacterial infection and metabolic reprogramming in <i>Marsupenaeus japonicus</i>.,"In recent years, with global warming and increasing marine pollution, some novel marine viruses have become widespread in the aquaculture industry, causing huge losses to the aquaculture industry. Decapod iridescent virus 1 (DIV1) is one of the newly discovered marine viruses that has been reported to be detected in a variety of farmed crustacean and wild populations. Several previous studies have found that DIV1 can induce Warburg effect-related gene expression. In this study, the effects of DIV1 infection on intestinal health of shrimp were further explored from the aspects of histological, enzymatic activities, microorganisms and metabolites using <i>Marsupenaeus japonicus</i> as the object of study. The results showed that obvious injury in the intestinal mucosa was observed after DIV1 infection, the oxidative and antioxidant capacity of the shrimp intestine was unbalanced, the activity of lysozyme was decreased, and the activities of digestive enzymes were disordered, and secondary bacterial infection was caused. Furthermore, the increased abundance of harmful bacteria, such as <i>Photobacterium</i> and <i>Vibrio</i>, may synergized with DIV1 to promote the Warburg effect and induce metabolic reprogramming, thereby providing material and energy for DIV1 replication. This study is the first to report the changes of intestinal microbiota and metabolites of <i>M. japonicus</i> under DIV1 infection, demonstrating that DIV1 can induce secondary bacterial infection and metabolic reprogramming. Several bacteria and metabolites highly associated with DIV1 infection were screened, which may be leveraged for diagnosis of pathogenic infections or incorporated as exogenous metabolites to enhance immune response.",He Z; Zhong Y; Liao M; Dai L; Wang Y; Zhang S; Sun C,Frontiers in immunology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36189245/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36183483,Possible metabolic interplay between quality of life and fecal microbiota in a presenior population: Preliminary results.,"The number of people aged ≥60 y is increasing worldwide, so establishing a relationship between lifestyle and health-associated factors, such as gut microbiota in an older population, is important. This study aimed to characterize the gut microbiota of a presenior population, and analyze the association between some bacteria and quality of life with the Short Form (SF) 36 questionnaire. Participants were adult men and women ages 50 to 80 y (n = 74). In addition to the SF-36 questionnaire, fecal samples were collected in cryotubes, and 16S RNA gene sequencing was performed to characterize microbial features. Participants were classified into two groups according to SF-36 punctuation. Linear and logistic regression models were performed to assess the possible association between any bacterial bowl and SF-36 score. Receiver operating characteristics curves were fitted to define the relative diagnostic strength of different bacterial taxa for the correct determination of quality of life. A positive relationship was established between SF-36 score and Actinobacteria (P = 0.0310; R = 0.2510) compared with Peptostreptococcaceae (P = 0.0259; R = -0.2589), which increased with decreasing quality of life. Logistic regressions models and receiver operating characteristics curves showed that the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Peptostreptococcaceae may be useful to predict quality of life in a presenior population (area under the curve: 0.71). Quality of life may be associated with the relative abundance of certain bacteria, especially Actinobacteria and Peptostreptococcaceae, which may have a specific effect on certain markers and health care, which is important to improve quality of life in older populations.",de Cuevillas B; Riezu-Boj JI; Abete I; Zulet MA; Galarregui C; Gonzalez-Navarro CJ; Milagro FI; Martínez JA; Navas-Carretero S,"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36183483/,0,0,0,0,0,0

High viscous guar gum down-regulated the intestinal tight junction, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic related gene's expression, decreased digesta butyrate/histamine ratio; and increased the abundance of Plesiomonas shigelloides. These results suggest that dietary guar gum adversely affects intestinal health by disrupting intestinal flora structure and metabolite composition, and that viscosity should be considered when using guar gum as a binder in aquafeeds.",Liu Y; Zhou H; Fan J; Huang H; Deng J; Tan B,International journal of biological macromolecules,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36181882/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36177469,A comprehensive map of microbial biomarkers along the gastrointestinal tract for celiac disease patients.,"Dysbiosis of the microbiome has been related to Celiac disease (CeD) progress, an autoimmune disease characterized by gluten intolerance developed in genetically susceptible individuals under certain environmental factors. The microbiome contributes to CeD pathophysiology, modulating the immune response by the action of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), affecting gut barrier integrity allowing the entrance of gluten-derived proteins, and degrading immunogenic peptides of gluten through endoprolyl peptidase enzymes. Despite the evidence suggesting the implication of gut microbiome over CeD pathogenesis, there is no consensus about the specific microbial changes observed in this pathology. Here, we compiled the largest dataset of 16S prokaryotic ribosomal RNA gene high-throughput sequencing for consensus profiling. We present for the first time an integrative analysis of metataxonomic data from patients with CeD, including samples from different body sites (saliva, pharynx, duodenum, and stool). We found the presence of coordinated changes through the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) characterized by an increase in <i>Actinobacteria</i> species in the upper GIT (pharynx and duodenum) and an increase in <i>Proteobacteria</i> in the lower GIT (duodenum and stool), as well as site-specific changes evidencing a dysbiosis in patients with CeD' microbiota. Moreover, we described the effect of adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) evidenced by an increase in beneficial bacteria and a decrease in some <i>Betaproteobacteriales</i> but not fully restoring CeD-related dysbiosis.

36079868,Pea Albumin Attenuates Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Colitis by Regulating NF-κB Signaling and the Intestinal Microbiota in Mice.,"Inflammatory bowel disease remains a global burden with rapidly increasing incidence and prevalence in both industrialized countries and developing countries. In this study, we prepared pea albumin from pea seeds and determined its beneficial effects being anti-inflammatory and on gut microbiota modulation in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-challenged mice. Six-week-old C57BL/6N male mice received an equivalent volume (200 μL) of sterile phosphate balanced solution, 0.375, 0.75, or 1.50 g/kg body weight (BW) of pea albumin that was subjected to 2.0% DSS for 7 days to induce colitis. On day 17 of the experiment, all mice were sacrificed after blood sample collection, and colon tissue and colon contents were collected. BW change curve, colon length, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, mucus staining, immunofluorescence staining of T cells and macrophages, cytokines, pro-inflammatory genes expression, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and signal transducer, and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathways as well as 16S DNA sequence were measured. Our results show that pea albumin alleviates DSS-induced BW loss, colon length shortening, enhanced MPO activity, cytokines secretion, mucus deficiency, and inflammatory cell infiltration, as well as enhanced pro-inflammatory genes expression. In addition, the overactivation of NF-κB and STAT3 following DSS exposure is attenuated by pea albumin administration. Of particular interest, pea albumin oral administration restored gut microbiota dysbiosis as evidenced by enhanced α-diversity, restored β-diversity, and promoted relative abundance of <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group</i>. Taken together, the data provided herein demonstrated that pea albumin plays a protective role in DSS-induced colitis by reducing inflammatory cell infiltration, pro-inflammatory genes expression and pro-inflammatory cytokines release, inactivation of NF-κB signal, and gut microbiota modulation.",Zhang S; Jin W; Zhang W; Ren F; Wang P; Liu N,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36079868/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36055959,Short-chain fatty acids are key mediators of the favorable effects of the Mediterranean diet on intestinal barrier integrity: data from the randomized controlled LIBRE trial.,"The Mediterranean diet is associated with the prevention of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, all of which are linked to intestinal barrier impairment. Here, we hypothesize that the Mediterranean diet, possibly via the induction of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), improves intestinal barrier integrity. Furthermore, we aim to establish novel personalized nutrition advice based on machine learning algorithms. We studied 260 women with intestinal barrier impairment. The women were allocated to follow either a Mediterranean diet or a control diet for 3 mo. Intestinal permeability was assessed by measuring lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) in plasma and zonulin in feces. SCFA concentrations were analyzed in feces. Bi- and multivariate analyses and machine learning algorithms (random forest classification) were conducted. Particularly in the intervention group, adherence to the Mediterranean diet increased, whereas plasma LBP and fecal zonulin concentrations decreased (all q < 0.001 for the intervention group, all q < 0.1 for control group). In the intervention group, fecal SCFA concentrations increased (propionate + 19%; butyrate + 44%; both q < 0.001). Multivariate analyses showed that adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with SCFA concentrations (all q < 0.001) and inversely associated with LBP and zonulin concentrations (all q < 0.02). Mediation analyses identified propionate and butyrate as the key mechanistic link between diet and intestinal permeability integrity. Accordingly, using baseline SCFA data, we could predict the effect of the Mediterranean diet on intestinal permeability using a machine learning algorithm (receiver operating characteristic AUC: 0.78-0.96). Our data suggest that SCFAs are key mediators for the relation between diet and gut health. Assessment of SCFAs may form a basis for personalized nutrition in future clinical care. These results need to be verified in larger studies powered for this purpose, comprising different study populations.

36055772,Research gaps and opportunities in precision nutrition: an NIH workshop report.,"Precision nutrition is an emerging concept that aims to develop nutrition recommendations tailored to different people's circumstances and biological characteristics. Responses to dietary change and the resulting health outcomes from consuming different diets may vary significantly between people based on interactions between their genetic backgrounds, physiology, microbiome, underlying health status, behaviors, social influences, and environmental exposures. On 11-12 January 2021, the National Institutes of Health convened a workshop entitled ""Precision Nutrition: Research Gaps and Opportunities"" to bring together experts to discuss the issues involved in better understanding and addressing precision nutrition. The workshop proceeded in 3 parts: part I covered many aspects of genetics and physiology that mediate the links between nutrient intake and health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer disease, and cancer; part II reviewed potential contributors to interindividual variability in dietary exposures and responses such as baseline nutritional status, circadian rhythm/sleep, environmental exposures, sensory properties of food, stress, inflammation, and the social determinants of health; part III presented the need for systems approaches, with new methods and technologies that can facilitate the study and implementation of precision nutrition, and workforce development needed to create a new generation of researchers. The workshop concluded that much research will be needed before more precise nutrition recommendations can be achieved. This includes better understanding and accounting for variables such as age, sex, ethnicity, medical history, genetics, and social and environmental factors. The advent of new methods and technologies and the availability of considerably more data bring tremendous opportunity. However, the field must proceed with appropriate levels of caution and make sure the factors listed above are all considered, and systems approaches and methods are incorporated. It will be important to develop and train an expanded workforce with the goal of reducing health disparities and improving precision nutritional advice for all Americans.",Lee BY; Ordovás JM; Parks EJ; Anderson CAM; Barabási AL; Clinton SK; de la Haye K; Duffy VB; Franks PW; Ginexi EM; Hammond KJ; Hanlon EC; Hittle M; Ho E; Horn AL; Isaacson RS; Mabry PL; Malone S; Martin CK; Mattei J; Meydani SN; Nelson LM; Neuhouser ML; Parent B; Pronk NP; Roche HM; Saria S; Scheer FAJL; Segal E; Sevick MA; Spector TD; Van Horn L; Varady KA; Voruganti VS; Martinez MF,The American journal of clinical nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36055772/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36031409,Tonsillar Microbiome-Derived Lantibiotics Induce Structural Changes of IL-6 and IL-21 Receptors and Modulate Host Immunity.,"Emerging evidence emphasizes the functional impacts of host microbiome on the etiopathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, there are limited mechanistic insights into the contribution of microbial biomolecules especially microbial peptides toward modulating immune homeostasis. Here, by mining the metagenomics data of tonsillar microbiome, a deficiency of the encoding genes of lantibiotic peptides salivaricins in RA patients is identified, which shows strong correlation with circulating immune cells. Evidence is provided that the salivaricins exert immunomodulatory effects in inhibiting T follicular helper (Tfh) cell differentiation and interleukin-21 (IL-21) production. Mechanically, salivaricins directly bind to and induce conformational changes of IL-6 and IL-21 receptors, thereby inhibiting the bindings of IL-6 and IL-21 to their receptors and suppressing the downstream signaling pathway. Finally, salivaricin administration exerts both prophylactic and therapeutic effects against experimental arthritis in a murine model of RA. Together, these results provide a mechanism link of microbial peptides-mediated immunomodulation.",Li J; Jin J; Li S; Zhong Y; Jin Y; Zhang X; Xia B; Zhu Y; Guo R; Sun X; Guo J; Hu F; Xiao W; Huang F; Ye H; Li R; Zhou Y; Xiang X; Yao H; Yan Q; Su L; Wu L; Luo T; Liu Y; Guo X; Qin J; Qi H; He J; Wang J; Li Z,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36031409/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Herein, this study aims to evaluate the potential of EU in obesity prevention and to delineate the mechanisms involved. Five-week-old male C57BL/6J mice are fed with high-fat diet (HFD) or HFD supplemented with EU (0.2%, w/w) for 13 weeks. EU significantly reduces obesity-related indexes including final body weight, body weight gain, adipocyte size, visceral fat-pad weight, and fasting blood glucose. EU prevents HFD-induced gut dysbiosis, as indicated by the increase of Firmicutes and decrease of Desulfobacterota at phylum level, and the increase of Dubosiella, Blautia, unclassified_f_Oscillospiraceae, and unclassified_f_Ruminococcaceae, and the decrease of Alistipes, Alloprevotella, and Bilophila at genus level. Notably, the obesity-related indexes are positively correlated with the relative abundances of Bacteroides, unclassified_f_Lachnospiraceae, Colidextribacter, and Bilophila, and negatively correlated with the relative abundances of norank_f_Muribaculaceae and Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group. Moreover, the preventive effects of EU on obesity are accompanied by the transcriptomic reprogramming of white adipose tissue.

The FBW, WGR and SGR were significantly higher and FCR was significantly lower in the G4 group compared to the G1 group (P < 0.05). Serum immune enzyme activities (ACP, AKP and LZM) rose and then fell and had the highest values in the G4 group (P < 0.05). The expression of TNF-α and IL6 in head kidney was significantly inhibited (P < 0.05), while the expression of TLR22 was increased (P < 0.05). After the Vibrio parahaemolyticus challenge test, ACP and AKP activities were increased in the G4 and G5 groups, while mortality was lower than in the G1 group (P < 0.05).

L. vannamei (initial body weight: 0.42 ± 0.01g) was fed for 8 weeks by four isonitrogenous and isolipid feeds with CPC replacing fishmeal (FM) at 0% (control), 15% (CPC15), 30% (CPC30) and 45% (CPC45), respectively. At the end of the study, the final body weight (FBW), weight gain rate (WGR), specific growth rate (SGR) and protein efficiency ratio (PER) of L. vannamei in CPC15 and CPC30 groups were significantly increased, while the feed conversion ratio (FCR) of L. vannamei in the CPC30 group was significantly reduced when compared with the FM group (P < 0.05). After Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection, the cumulative mortality of L. vannamei in CPC15 within 24 hpi was significantly lower than that of the control group (P < 0.05). When compared with the control group, the activities and expression of the immunity-related enzymes in the hepatopancreas had almost the same obvious change trend in the CPC-containing groups, which indicated that the replacement for fishmeal by CPC led to significant immune response in L. vannamei. Besides, significant up-regulation of the digestive enzyme activities were observed in the CPC-containing groups. Analysis of intestinal microbiota showed that significant difference in alpha diversity existed between the CPC-containing groups and the control group. The relative abundances of several top 10 dominated species at the phylum and genus levels were significantly changed in the CPC-containing groups compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Functional prediction of the microbiota indicated that the pathway of protein digestion and absorption was significantly more abundant while the pathways of nitrotoluene degradation, aminobenzoate degradation, atrazine degradation, dioxin degradation and xylene degradation were significantly less abundant in the CPC-containing groups than the FM group (P < 0.05). In summary, optimal dietary CPC replacement of FM could improve the growth, immunity, digestive capacity and the diversities of the intestinal microbial flora of L. vannamei.

Four isoproteic and isolipidic experimental diets were formulated (crude protein 42.50%, crude lipid 13.70%) to contain 8% cellulose (control group; 5.14 mPa s), 8% low viscous carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) with 800 mPa s (Lvs-CMC group; 182.15 mPa s), 8% middle viscous CMC with 2000 mPa s (Mvs-CMC group; 320.48 mPa s) and 8% high viscous CMC with 5000 mPa s (Hvs-CMC group; 440.65 mPa s), respectively. The weight gain rate, specific growth rate, protein efficiency ratio, protein and lipid deposition rate in the CMC groups were dramatically lower than those in the control group, while feed conversion rate showed an opposite result. Plasma diamine oxidase activity, endothelin-1 and lipopolysaccharide concentrations in the Mvs-CMC and Hvs-CMC groups were significantly higher than in the control group, accompanied by a significant down-regulation of Occludin, Caludin-1 and Caludin-4. Intestinal glutathione concentration, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in the CMC groups were significantly lower than in the control group, accompanied by a significant up-regulation of Keap1 and down-regulation of Nrf2. Moreover, CMC diets dramatically down-regulated the expression levels of IL-10 and TGF-β1. Digesta total short chain fatty acid and acetate concentrations in the CMC groups were dramatically higher than in the control group, while butyrate concentration showed an opposite result. The OTU, Sobs, Shannon and Simpson indices of intestinal flora in the CMC groups were dramatically lower than in the control group. Notably, structural analysis showed that dietary CMC dramatically increased the abundance of C. somerae and P. shigelloides, but reduced the abundance of C. colicanis and C. perfringens. In summary, increasing dietary viscosity adversely affects the intestinal flora structure and diversity, increases acetate/butyrate-producing bacterial ratio and the abundance of pathogenic microorganisms, disrupting intestinal flora homeostasis, impairs mucosa barrier function, induces intestinal inflammation and epithelial cell apoptosis in juvenile largemouth bass. Our findings demonstrate that soluble cellulose is more detrimental to intestinal health and growth in juvenile largemouth bass compared to insoluble cellulose, and the adverse effects of soluble cellulose are mainly caused by its viscosity. Importantly, this study demonstrate that viscosity is the main characteristic of non-starch polysaccharides that are detrimental to the intestinal health of fish.",Liu Y; Cao Y; Zhang Y; Fan J; Zhou H; Huang H; Jiang W; Zhang W; Deng J; Tan B,Fish & shellfish immunology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35863540/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35857424,Bacteria-induced amino acid metabolism involved in appearance characteristics of high-temperature Daqu.,"Significant changes occurd in Daqu bricks on the 15th day of incubation, and brick color (yellow, brown, or dark) is generally used as a standard for quality evaluation by experienced workers. This study aimed to explore the basis behind the phenomenon through multi-omics studies. The physicochemical properties of different high-temperature Daqu were compared. Furthermore, PacBio sequencing and the ultra-high-performance liquid chromatographic-Q-exactive-mass spectrometric approach were employed to analyze the differences in the microbiome and metabolome among different Daqu samples. Bacillus was the biomarker of yellow Daqu, Thermoactinomyces and Thermoascus were the key genera in brown Daqu, and Burkholderiales, Sphingomonas, and Ralstonia were biomarkers in dark Daqu. The physicochemical characteristics (especially the color values) of different high-temperature Daqu showed strong correlations with the bacterial alpha diversity and the relative abundance of dominant bacterial genera. Amino acid metabolism pathways including tryptophan metabolism, β-alanine metabolism, and arginine biosynthesis were the key factors resulting in the characteristic differences where Bacillus, Burkholderia, Ralstonia, and Sphingomonas were pivotal bacterial genera. The relative abundance of Bacillus had a positive correlation with the content of 3-hydroxykynurenamine, l-glutamic acid, and pantothenic acid, while it showed a negative correlation with indoleacetic acid, l-tryptophan, N-acetylserotonin, l-histidine, l-aspartic acid, phosphatidylserine, 5-methoxyindoleacetate, and L-serine.

35840201,"Insights into the bacterial, fungal, and phage communities and volatile profiles in different types of Daqu.","Daqu has a rich and diverse microbiota, giving them a suitable biotope for phages. However, the absolute abundances of bacteria and fungi, as well as the phage community characteristics in Daqu, remain unclear. In this study, the microbiota absolute abundance, indigenous phage composition and function, and volatile compound profiles of high-temperature Daqu (HTDQ), medium-temperature Daqu (MTDQ), and low-temperature Daqu (LTDQ) were investigated. Absolute microbiota quantification revealed that there were significant variations in microbial composition and absolute abundance across three types of Daqu. The absolute abundances of the top 30 bacterial genera in LTDQ, MTDQ, and HTDQ were 6.0 × 10<sup>5</sup>, 5.3 × 10<sup>4</sup>, 1.4 × 10<sup>5</sup> copies/ng DNA, while the top 30 fungal genera had 8.5 × 10<sup>7</sup>, 2.1 × 10<sup>6</sup>, and 6.2 × 10<sup>5</sup> copies/ng DNA, respectively. LTDQ were enriched in Pantoea, Staphylococcus, and Saccharomycopsis; MTDQ were dominated by Saccharopolyspora, Staphylococcus, Saccharomycopsis, and Aspergillus; HTDQ were dominated by Saccharopolyspora, Bacillus, Byssochlamys, and Saccharomycopsis. Volatile profile analysis revealed that LTDQ, MTDQ, and HTDQ comprised 68, 68, and 75 compounds, respectively, with 39 compounds shared by the three types. Fourteen volatile compounds were identified as highly discriminative features among three types of Daqu, which were closely related to Saccharopolyspora, Thermoactinomyces, Kroppenstedtia, Byssochlamys, and Thermomyces. Metaviromics indicated that Genomoviridae, Mimiviridae and Siphoviridae, and Parvoviridae were the dominant viruses in LTDQ, MTDQ, and HTDQ, respectively. The hosts of phages in Daqu mainly included Lactobacillus, Enterobacter, Pantoea, Bacillus, Pediococcus, and Staphylococcus. Phages may prey on numerous microbes living on Daqu via pathways such as genetic information processing, signaling and cellular processes, and replication and repair.

35777110,A weight-loss model based on baseline microbiota and genetic scores for selection of dietary treatments in overweight and obese population.,"The response to weight loss depends on the interindividual variability of determinants such as gut microbiota and genetics. The aim of this investigation was to develop an integrative model using microbiota and genetic information to prescribe the most suitable diet for a successful weight loss in individuals with excess of body weight. A total of 190 Spanish overweight and obese participants were randomly assigned to two hypocaloric diets for 4 months: 61 women and 29 men followed a moderately high protein (MHP) diet, and 72 women and 28 men followed a low fat (LF) diet. Baseline fecal DNA was sequenced and used for the construction of four microbiota subscores associated with the percentage of BMI loss for each diet (MHP and LF) and for each sex. Bootstrapping techniques and multiple linear regression models were used for the selection of families, genera and species included in the subscores. Finally, two total microbiota scores were generated for each sex. Two genetic subscores previously reported to weight loss were used to generate a total genetic score. In an attempt to personalize the weight loss prescription, several linear mixed models that included interaction with diet between microbiota scores and genetic scores for both, men and women, were studied. The microbiota subscore for the women who followed the MHP-diet included Coprococcus, Dorea, Flavonifractor, Ruminococcus albus and Clostridium bolteaea. For LF-diet women, Cytophagaceae, Catabacteriaceae, Flammeovirgaceae, Rhodobacteriaceae, Clostridium-x1vb, Bacteriodes nordiiay, Alistipes senegalensis, Blautia wexlerae and Psedoflavonifractor phocaeensis. For MHP-diet men, Cytophagaceae, Acidaminococcaceae, Marinilabiliaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Fusicatenibacter, Odoribacter and Ruminococcus faecis; and for LF-men, Porphyromanadaceae, Intestinimonas, Bacteroides finegoldii and Clostridium bartlettii. The mixed models with microbiota scores facilitated the selection of diet in 72% of women and in 84% of men. The model including genetic information allows to select the type of diet in 84% and 73%, respectively. Decision algorithm models can help to select the most adequate type of weight loss diet according to microbiota and genetic information.

The objective of the current study was to investigate the preventative effects of G. pentaphyllum and Gypenoside-IV (GP-IV, a saponin monomer in G. pentaphyllum) on metabolic symptoms in high fat diet induced obese (DIO) mice with gut microbiota dysbiosis. G. pentaphyllum water extract (GPWE, 150 mg/kg•d<sup>- 1</sup>) and GP-IV (50 mg/kg•d<sup>- 1</sup>) were orally administered to DIO mice by gavage for 10 weeks. The results showed that both GPWE and GP-IV prevented obesity development by decreasing body weight gain, reducing fat mass/body weight ratio and inhibiting adipocyte hypertrophy. GPWE and GP-IV also improved lipid profile and glucose tolerance effectively. Moreover, GPWE and GP-IV treatments partly restored gut microbiota in DIO mice. Typically, GPWE and GP-IV reduced Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, increased the abundance of certain health-promoting bacteria and reduced the abundance of microbiota that were associated with metabolic disorders. We conclude that GPWE and GP-IV can ameliorate metabolic symptoms possibly via modulating gut microbiota in DIO mice.",Shu X; Chen R; Yang M; Xu J; Gao R; Hu Y; He X; Zhao C,"Plant foods for human nutrition (Dordrecht, Netherlands)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35705767/,0,0,0,0,0,0

35631266,Metagenomic Analysis Reveals a Mitigating Role for <i>Lactobacillus paracasei</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i> in Experimental Periodontitis.,"Probiotics have aroused increasing concern as an intervention strategy for periodontitis (PD), but their underlying mechanism of action remains poorly characterized. Regarding the significance of oral microbiota dysbiosis related to PD, we predicted that the preventive activity of probiotics may be influenced by suppressing the bacterial pathogenicity. Herein, we investigated the effects of <i>Lactobacillus paracasei</i> L9 (L9) and <i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i> A6 (A6) on PD using a rat model, and demonstrated a regulatory effect of probiotics on oral flora from a metagenomics perspective. Oral administration of A6 or L9 effectively relieved gingival bleeding, periodontal inflammatory infiltration, and alveolar bone resorption. In addition, A6 or L9 treatment reduced the inflammatory response and increased the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines, which we expected to ameliorate alveolar bone resorption as mediated by the receptor activator of the nuclear factor-κB ligand/OPG signaling pathway. More importantly, using metagenomic sequencing, we showed that probiotics significantly altered the taxonomic composition of the subgingival microbiome, and reduced the relative proportions of pathogenic bacterial genera such as <i>Streptococcus</i>, <i>Fusobacterium</i>, <i>Veillonella</i>, and <i>Escherichia</i>. Both probiotics significantly inhibited levels of bacterial virulence factors related to adherence, invasion, exoenzyme, and complement protease functions that are strongly correlated with the pathogenesis of PD.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestine that can cause abdominal pain and diarrhea. With this study, we aimed to explore the protective effect of RJ on DSS-induced colitis in mice. The physiochemical parameters (water, protein, 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid, total sugar, starch, ash and acidity) of the RJ samples used in this study met the requirements of the international and Chinese national standards. Treatment with RJ improved symptoms and colonic cell apoptosis and decreased intestinal permeability by increasing the expression of tight-junction protein, goblet cells and their secretion mucin, MUC2, in DSS-induced ulcerative colitis mice. RJ also reduced the expression of proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and increased the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and sIgA. DSS resulted in an increase in the relative abundance of <i>Parabacteroides</i>, <i>Erysipelotrichaceae</i>, <i>Proteobacteria</i> (<i>Gammaproteobacteria</i>, <i>Enterobacteriales</i> and <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>) and <i>Escherichia Shigella</i> in the colon and a decrease in the relative abundance of <i>Muribaculum</i>. In the RJ treatment group, the relative abundance of the above intestinal flora was improved by treatment with 2.0 g/kg RJ.

This study investigated their effects on the growth performance, intestinal immune defense, and microbiome in juvenile pearl gentian groupers (<i>Epinephelus fuscoguttatus</i>♀ × <i>Epinephelus lanceolatus</i>♂). Three isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets were formulated containing fishmeal supplemented with 70 g/kg β-conglycinin or 100 g/kg glycinin, or no supplementation (control). Each experimental diet was fed to quadruplicate groups with 30 fish in each tank for 8 weeks. Dietary inclusion of either β-conglycinin or glycinin significantly reduced weight gain and specific growth rates, and cell proliferation of the distal intestine. Histological evaluation of the intestine tract revealed the inflammation signs, characterized by reducing of plica height and width as well as the number of the goblet cells, and widening of the lamina propria. The group fed the β-conglycinin diet had reduced lysozyme activity, contents of immunoglobulin M and complements 3 and 4. Increased activities of caspase-3 and -9 were observed in the group fed the β-conglycinin diet compared to the other 2 groups. In the intestinal microbiota, the relative abundances of the potentially pathogenic genera <i>Photobacterium</i> and <i>Vibrio</i> were significantly higher in the glycinin group than those in others. Therefore, the existence of soybean antigens (β-conglycinin or glycinin) could damage the structural integrity of the intestine, reduce immune defense, reshape the intestinal microbiome and, ultimately, impair growth in fish.",He Y; Liang J; Dong X; Liu H; Yang Q; Zhang S; Chi S; Tan B,Animal nutrition (Zhongguo xu mu shou yi xue hui),2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35600546/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35571941,Increased Relative Abundance of <i>Ruminoccocus</i> Is Associated With Reduced Cardiovascular Risk in an Obese Population.,"Obesity is a complex disease with underlying genetic, environmental, psychological, physiological, medical, and epigenetic factors. Obesity can cause various disorders, including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), that are among the most prevalent chronic conditions in Qatar. Recent studies have highlighted the significant roles of the gut microbiome in improving the pathology of various diseases, including obesity. Thus, in this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of dietary intake and gut microbial composition in modulating the risk of CVD development in obese Qatari adults. We enrolled 46 adult subjects (18-65 years of age) who were classified based on their CVD risk scores, calculated using the Framingham formula, into a CVD no-risk group (score of <10%, <i>n</i> = 36) and CVD risk group (score of ≥10%, <i>n</i> = 10). For each study subject, we measured the gut microbial composition with a 16s rDNA sequencing method that targeted the v3-v4 region using Illumina Miseq, and their nutritional status was recorded based on 24-h dietary recall. Dietary intake, bacterial taxa summary, diversity index, microbial markers, pathway analysis, and network correlation were determined for the study subjects. The CVD risk group showed a lower intake of vitamin D, reduced relative abundance of genera <i>Ruminococcus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, no change in bacterial diversity, and higher levels of taurine, hypotaurine, and lipoic acid metabolism than the CVD no-risk group. Besides, the relative abundance of genus <i>Ruminococcus</i> was positively correlated with the intake of protein, monounsaturated fat, vitamin A, and vitamin D. Taken together, our results suggest that the genus <i>Ruminococcus</i> could be used as a microbial marker, and its reduced relative abundance could mediate the risk of CVDs in the Obese Qatari population.",Lakshmanan AP; Al Zaidan S; Bangarusamy DK; Al-Shamari S; Elhag W; Terranegra A,Frontiers in nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35571941/,0,0,0,0,0,0

To explore the effect of PO on ameliorating obesity and modulating the gut microbiota, we administered the mice with a low-fat diet or high-fat diet containing different dosages of PO (mass fraction: 0%, 2.5%, 5% and 10%). The body weight, adipose tissue weight, GTT, ITT, blood lipids, serum biomarkers of liver/kidney function, the gut microbiota and function were measured and analyzed after 6 weeks of PO treatment. The results showed PO prevented obesity, maintained glucose homeostasis and beneficially modulated gut microbiota. PO modified the composition and functions of gut microbiota in obese mice and make them similar to those in lean mice, which contributed to weight loss. PO significantly increased the relative abundance of <i>Oscillospira</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i> group and <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, while decreased the relative abundance of <i>Bacteroides</i> and <i>Roseburia</i>. The prediction of gut microbiota function showed PO upregulated lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, bile acid biosynthesis, while it downregulated adipocytokine signaling pathway and steroid hormone biosynthesis. Correlation analysis further suggested the potential relationship among obesity, gut microbiota and the function of gut microbiota. In conclusion, all the results indicated that PO ameliorated obesity at least partly by modulating the gut microbiota.",Hu Y; Xu J; Sheng Y; Liu J; Li H; Guo M; Xu W; Luo Y; Huang K; He X,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35565835/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35561742,"Perspectives: on Precision Nutrition Research in Heart, Lung, and Blood Diseases and Sleep Disorders.","The release of the 2020-2030 Strategic Plan for NIH Nutrition Research (SPNR) and its emphasis on precision nutrition has provided an opportunity to identify future nutrition research that addresses individual variability in response to diet and nutrition across the life span-including those relevant to the Strategic Vision of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). The SPNR and the NHLBI's Strategic Vision were developed with extensive input from the extramural research community, and both have 4 overarching strategic goals within which are embedded several objectives for research. For the SPNR, these include 1) spur discovery science and normal biological functions (e.g., role of the microbiome in health and disease), 2) population science to understand individual differences (e.g., biomarkers including 'omics that predict disease status), 3) emerging scientific areas of investigation and their application (e.g., data science, artificial intelligence), and 4) cross-cutting themes (e.g., training the scientific workforce and minority health and health disparities). These strategic goals and objectives serve as blueprints for research and training. Nutrition remains important in the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, blood, and sleep (HLBS) disorders and diseases, and the NHLBI has played a pivotal role in supporting nutrition research. In this paper, we report important gaps in the scientific literature related to precision nutrition in HLBS diseases. Research opportunities that could stimulate precision nutrition and their alignment with the SPNR and the NHLBI Strategic Vision Objectives are provided. These opportunities include 1) exploring individual differences in response to varying dietary patterns and nutrients; 2) investigating genetic/epigenetic, biological (e.g., microbiome, biomarkers), social, psychosocial, and environmental underpinnings of individual variability in diet; 3) elucidating the role of circadian rhythm and chrononutrition; and 4) applying implementation science research methods in precision nutrition interventions relevant to HLBS diseases.",Pratt CA; Brown AGM; Dixit S; Farmer N; Natarajan A; Boyington J; Shi S; Lu Q; Cotton P,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35561742/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35512761,Almond Consumption for 8 Weeks Altered Host and Microbial Metabolism in Comparison to a Control Snack in Young Adults.,"Almond consumption can improve cardiometabolic (CM) health. However, the mechanisms underlying those benefits are not well characterized. This study explored the effects of consuming a snack of almonds vs. crackers for 8 weeks on changes in metabolomic profiles in young adults (clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT03084003). Participants (n = 73, age: 18-19 years, BMI: 18-41 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were randomly assigned to consume either almonds (2 oz/d, n = 38) or an isocaloric control snack of graham crackers (325 kcal/d, n = 35) daily for 8 weeks. Blood samples were collected at baseline prior to and at 4 and 8 weeks after the intervention. Metabolite abundances in the serum were quantified by hydrophilic interaction chromatography quadrupole (Q) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS/MS), gas chromatography (GC) TOF MS, CSH-ESI (electrospray) QTOF MS/MS, and targeted analyses for free PUFAs, total fatty acids, oxylipins and endocannabinoids. Linear mixed model analyses with baseline-adjustment were conducted, and those results were used for enrichment and network analyses. Microbial community pathway predictions from 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples was done using PICRUST2. Almond consumption enriched unsaturated triglycerides, unsaturated phosphatidylcholines, saturated and unsaturated lysophosphatidylcholines, tricarboxylic acids, and tocopherol clusters (p < 0.05). Targeted analyses reveal lower levels of omega-3 total fatty acids (TFAs) overall in the almond group compared to the cracker group (p < 0.05). Microbial amino acid biosynthesis, and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism pathways were also differentially enriched at the end of the intervention (p < 0.05). The study demonstrates the differential effects of almonds on host tocopherol, lipid, and TCA cycle metabolism with potential changes in microbial metabolism, which may interact with host metabolism to facilitate the CM benefits.",Dhillon J; Newman JW; Fiehn O; Ortiz RM,Journal of the American Nutrition Association,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35512761/,0,0,0,0,1,0

Here we performed faecal metagenomic, serum metabolomics and neuroimaging studies on a cohort of 109 unmedicated patients with depressed bipolar disorder (BD) patients and 40 healthy controls (HCs) to characterise the microbial-gut-brain axis in BD. Across over 12,000 measured metabolic features, we observed a large discrepancy (73.54%) in the serum metabolome between BD patients and HCs, spotting differentially abundant microbial-derived neuroactive metabolites including multiple B-vitamins, kynurenic acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid and short-chain fatty acids. These metabolites could be linked to the abundance of gut microbiota presented with corresponding biosynthetic potentials, including Akkermansia muciniphila, Citrobacter spp. (Citrobacter freundii and Citrobacter werkmanii), Phascolarctobacterium spp., Yersinia spp. (Yersinia frederiksenii and Yersinia aleksiciae), Enterobacter spp. (Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter kobei) and Flavobacterium spp. Based on functional neuroimaging, BD-related neuroactive microbes and metabolites were discovered as potential markers associated with BD-typical features of functional connectivity of brain networks, hinting at aberrant cognitive function, emotion regulation, and interoception.

35409083,Sturgeon Chondroitin Sulfate Restores the Balance of Gut Microbiota in Colorectal Cancer Bearing Mice.,"Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is a well-known bioactive substance with multiple biological functions, which can be extracted from animal cartilage or bone. Sturgeon, the largest soft bone animal with ~20% cartilage content, is a great candidate for CS production. Our recent study confirmed the role of sturgeon chondroitin sulfate (SCS) in reducing colorectal cancer cell proliferation and tumor formation. Here, we further studied the effect of SCS on modulating gut microbiome structure in colorectal cancer bearing mice. In this study, the transplanted tumor mice model was constructed to demonstrate that SCS can effectively halt the growth of transplanted colorectal tumor cells. Next, we showed that SCS significantly altered the gut microbiome, such as the abundance of Lactobacillales, Gastranaerophilales, Ruminiclostridiun_5 and Ruminiclostridiun_6. According to linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and abundance map analysis of the microbial metabolic pathways, the changes in microbial abundance led to an increase of certain metabolites (e.g., Phe, Tyr, and Gly). Fecal metabolome results demonstrated that SCS can significantly reduce the amount of certain amino acids such as Phe, Pro, Ala, Tyr and Leu presented in the feces, suggesting that SCS might inhibit colorectal cancer growth by modulating the gut microbiome and altering the production of certain amino acids. Our results revealed the therapeutic potential of SCS to facilitate treatment of colorectal cancer.

39295781,Involvement of microbiota and short-chain fatty acids on non-alcoholic steatohepatitis when induced by feeding a hypercaloric diet rich in saturated fat and fructose.,"Consumption of high-energy-yielding diets, rich in fructose and lipids, is a factor contributing to the current increase in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease prevalence. Gut microbiota composition and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production alterations derived from unhealthy diets are considered putative underlying mechanisms. This study aimed to determine relationships between changes in gut microbiota composition and SCFA levels by comparing rats featuring diet-induced steatohepatitis with control counterparts fed a standard diet. A high-fat high-fructose (HFHF) feeding induced higher body, liver and mesenteric adipose tissue weights, increased liver triglyceride content and serum transaminase, glucose, non-HDL-c and MCP-1 levels. Greater liver malondialdehyde levels and glutathione peroxidase activity were also observed after feeding the hypercaloric diet. Regarding gut microbiota composition, a lowered diversity and increased abundances of bacteria from the <i>Clostridium</i> sensu stricto 1, <i>Blautia</i>, <i>Eubacterium coprostanoligenes</i> group, <i>Flavonifractor</i>, and UBA1819 genera were found in rats featuring diet-induced steatohepatitis, as well as higher isobutyric, valeric and isovaleric acids concentrations. These results suggest that hepatic alterations produced by a hypercaloric HFHF diet may be related to changes in overall gut microbiota composition and abundance of specific bacteria. The shift in SCFA levels produced by this unbalanced diet cannot be discarded as potential mediators of the reported hepatic and metabolic alterations.",Milton-Laskibar I; Marcos-Zambrano LJ; Gómez-Zorita S; Carrillo de Santa Pau E; Fernández-Quintela A; Martínez JA; Portillo MP,"Gut microbiome (Cambridge, England)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39295781/,0,0,0,0,0,0

The present study focused on two outcomes of feeding pearl gentian groupers with high levels of soybean meal (SBM): (1) growth performance and (2) the intestinal environment, including tissue structure, flora profile, and immune responses. Some 720 groupers were randomly divided into three groups (<i>n</i> = 4): (1) controls, fed a 50% fish meal feed (FM), (2) with 20% of the FM substituted with SBM (SBM20), and (3) 40% of the FM substituted with SBM (SBM40). The fish were fed these iso-nitrogenous and iso-lipidic diets for 10 weeks. They were kept in containers with 1 m<sup>3</sup> of water under natural light and temperature levels. The experimental results demonstrate that the SBM diets significantly degraded growth performance and intestinal physiology. Typical enteritis characteristics and immune fluctuations appeared, as reflected by the enzyme activities of total superoxide dismutase and lysozyme, and the contents of immunoglobulin M, complement 3, and complement 4. 16SrDNA high-throughput sequencing showed that the intestinal flora was significantly affected, with the abundance of harmful bacteria, such as <i>Vibrio</i> and <i>Streptococcus</i>, increasing with dietary SBM level. Based on ""3 + 2"" full-length transcriptome sequencing, three triggered PRRs were found in the intestine: the RIG-like receptor, NOD-like receptor, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways. The intestinal flora variations were significantly correlated with the activation of the three PRR signaling pathways by canonical correlation analysis. These culminated in the transcriptome activation of NF-κB, IRFs, and costimulatory molecules, ultimately promoting the expressions of proinflammatory cytokines, interferons (IFNs), chemokines, and other molecules vital to the innate and/or adaptive immune responses.

35183765,Integrating longitudinal clinical and microbiome data to predict growth faltering in preterm infants.,"Preterm birth affects more than 10% of all births worldwide. Such infants are much more prone to Growth Faltering (GF), an issue that has been unsolved despite the implementation of numerous interventions aimed at optimizing preterm infant nutrition. To improve the ability for early prediction of GF risk for preterm infants we collected a comprehensive, large, and unique clinical and microbiome dataset from 3 different sites in the US and the UK. We use and extend machine learning methods for GF prediction from clinical data. We next extend graphical models to integrate time series clinical and microbiome data. A model that integrates clinical and microbiome data improves on the ability to predict GF when compared to models using clinical data only. Information on a small subset of the taxa is enough to help improve model accuracy and to predict interventions that can improve outcome. We show that a hierarchical classifier that only uses a subset of the taxa for a subset of the infants is both the most accurate and cost-effective method for GF prediction. Further analysis of the best classifiers enables the prediction of interventions that can improve outcome.",Lugo-Martinez J; Xu S; Levesque J; Gallagher D; Parker LA; Neu J; Stewart CJ; Berrington JE; Embleton ND; Young G; Gregory KE; Good M; Tandon A; Genetti D; Warren T; Bar-Joseph Z,Journal of biomedical informatics,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35183765/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35133187,Stratification of the Gut Microbiota Composition Landscape across the Alzheimer's Disease Continuum in a Turkish Cohort.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a heterogeneous disorder that spans a continuum with multiple phases, including preclinical, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia. Unlike for most other chronic diseases, human studies reporting on AD gut microbiota in the literature are very limited. With the scarcity of approved drugs for AD therapies, the rational and precise modulation of gut microbiota composition using diet and other tools is a promising approach to the management of AD. Such an approach could be personalized if an AD continuum can first be deconstructed into multiple strata based on specific microbiota features by using single or multiomics techniques. However, stratification of AD gut microbiota has not been systematically investigated before, leaving an important research gap for gut microbiota-based therapeutic approaches. Here, we analyze 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of stool samples from 27 patients with mild cognitive impairment, 47 patients with AD, and 51 nondemented control subjects by using tools compatible with the compositional nature of microbiota. To stratify the AD gut microbiota community, we applied four machine learning techniques, including partitioning around the medoid clustering and fitting a probabilistic Dirichlet mixture model, the latent Dirichlet allocation model, and we performed topological data analysis for population-scale microbiome stratification based on the Mapper algorithm. These four distinct techniques all converge on <i>Prevotella</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i> stratification of the gut microbiota across the AD continuum, while some methods provided fine-scale resolution in stratifying the community landscape. Finally, we demonstrate that the signature taxa and neuropsychometric parameters together robustly classify the groups. Our results provide a framework for precision nutrition approaches aiming to modulate the AD gut microbiota. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The prevalence of AD worldwide is estimated to reach 131 million by 2050. Most disease-modifying treatments and drug trials have failed, due partly to the heterogeneous and complex nature of the disease. Recent studies demonstrated that gut dybiosis can influence normal brain function through the so-called ""gut-brain axis."" Modulation of the gut microbiota, therefore, has drawn strong interest in the clinic in the management of the disease. However, there is unmet need for microbiota-informed stratification of AD clinical cohorts for intervention studies aiming to modulate the gut microbiota. Our study fills in this gap and draws attention to the need for microbiota stratification as the first step for microbiota-based therapy. We demonstrate that while <i>Prevotella</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i> clusters are the consensus partitions, the newly developed probabilistic methods can provide fine-scale resolution in partitioning the AD gut microbiome landscape.",Yıldırım S; Nalbantoğlu ÖU; Bayraktar A; Ercan FB; Gündoğdu A; Velioğlu HA; Göl MF; Soylu AE; Koç F; Gülpınar EA; Kadak KS; Arıkan M; Mardinoğlu A; Koçak M; Köseoğlu E; Hanoğlu L,mSystems,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35133187/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35104729,"Role of diet-microbiota interactions in precision nutrition of the chicken: facts, gaps, and new concepts.","In the intestine, host-derived factors are genetically hardwired and difficult to modulate. However, the intestinal microbiome is more plastic and can be readily modulated by dietary factors. Further, it is becoming more apparent that the microbiome can potentially impact poultry physiology by participating in digestion, the absorption of nutrients, shaping of the mucosal immune response, energy homeostasis, and the synthesis or modulation of several potential bioactive metabolites. These activities are dependent on the quantity and quality of the microbiota alongside its metabolic potential, which are dictated in large part by diet. Thus, diet-induced microbiota alterations may be harnessed to induce changes in host physiology, including disease development and progression. In this regard, the gut microbiome is malleable and renders the gut microbiome a candidate 'organ' for the possibility of precision nutrition to induce precision microbiomics-the use of the gut microbiome as a biomarker to predict responsiveness to specific dietary constituents to generate precision diets and interventions for optimal poultry performance and health. However, it is vital to identify the causal relationships and mechanisms by which dietary components and additives affect the gut microbiome which then ultimately influence avian physiology. Further, an improved understanding of the spatial and functional relationships between the different sections of the avian gut and their regional microbiota will provide a better understanding of the role of the diet in regulating the intestinal microbiome.",Kogut MH,Poultry science,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35104729/,0,0,0,0,0,0

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of milk polar lipids on gut microbiota and glucose metabolism in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed rat dams. Sprague Dawley (SD) female rats were fed a HFD for 8 weeks to induce obesity, followed by HFD with or without oral administration of polar lipids-enriched milk fat globule membrane (MFGM-PL) at 400 mg/kg BW during pregnancy and lactation. At the end of lactation, fresh fecal samples of dams were collected, the gut microbiota was assessed, and the insulin-signaling protein expression in peripheral tissues (adipose tissue, liver and skeletal muscle) were measured. MFGM-PL supplementation attenuated body weight gain, ameliorated serum lipid profiles and improved insulin sensitivity in obese dams at the end of lactation. 16 S rDNA sequencing revealed that MFGM-PL increased the community richness and diversity of gut microbiota. The composition of gut microbiota was also changed after MFGM-PL supplementation as shown by an increase in the ratio of Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes and the relative abundance of Akkermansia, as well as a decrease in the relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae. The functional prediction of microbial communities by PICRUSt analysis showed that there were 7 KEGG pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism changed after MFGM-PL supplementation to HFD dams, including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and insulin signaling pathway. Furthermore, MFGM-PL improved insulin signaling in the peripheral tissues including liver, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. MFGM-PL supplementation during pregnancy and lactation improves the glucose metabolism disorders in HFD-induced obese dams, which may be linked to the regulation of gut microbiota induced by MFGM-PL.",Li T; Yuan Q; Gong H; Du M; Mao X,International journal of obesity (2005),2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35091670/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35057449,Precision Nutrition Model Predicts Glucose Control of Overweight Females Following the Consumption of Potatoes High in Resistant Starch.,"Individual glycemic responses following dietary intake result from complex physiological processes, and can be influenced by physical properties of foods, such as increased resistant starch (RS) from starch retrogradation. Predictive equations are needed to provide personalized dietary recommendations to reduce chronic disease development. Therefore, a precision nutrition model predicting the postprandial glucose response (PPGR) in overweight women following the consumption of potatoes was formulated. Thirty overweight women participated in this randomized crossover trial. Participants consumed 250 g of hot (9.2 g RS) or cold (13.7 g RS) potatoes on two separate occasions. Baseline characteristics included demographics, 10-day dietary records, body composition, and the relative abundance (RA) and α-diversity of gut microbiota. Elastic net regression using 5-fold cross-validation predicted PPGR after potato intake. Most participants (70%) had a favorable PPGR to the cold potato. The model explained 32.2% of the variance in PPGR with the equation: 547.65 × (0 [if cold, high-RS potato], ×1, if hot, low-RS potato]) + (BMI [kg/m<sup>2</sup>] × 40.66)-(insoluble fiber [g] × 49.35) + (<i>Bacteroides</i> [RA] × 8.69)-(<i>Faecalibacterium</i> [RA] × 73.49)-(<i>Parabacteroides</i> [RA] × 42.08) + (α-diversity × 110.87) + 292.52.

Four diets were formulated, 0% (0 g kg<sup>-1</sup>), 10% (50 g kg<sup>-1</sup>), 20% (100 g kg<sup>-1</sup>) and 30% (150 g kg<sup>-1</sup>) fishmeal were replaced with BSF, named as FM, BSF10, BSF20, BSF30, severally. The study found that, with the increasing dietary BSF levels, growth and feed conversion ratio of fish decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Chitinase and trypsin activities were significantly increased with increasing dietary BSF levels (P < 0.05). With the increasing dietary BSF levels, distal intestinal muscularis thickness and mucosal fold length decreased significantly (P < 0.05), as well as total abundance of intestinal flora. The relative abundance of four phyla and six genera among the top 20 genera were significantly affected by dietary BSF levels (P < 0.05).

34915018,Microbiota composition is moderately associated with greenspace composition in a UK cohort of twins.,"Exposure to natural environments, known as greenspace, appears to positively influence health, yet the mechanisms are unclear. Given that gut microbiota are associated with inflammatory disorders more prevalent in urban areas and individuals with lower greenspace exposure, microbiota may act as a mediator between greenspace and health. Using 2443 participants of the TwinsUK cohort, microbiota differences were compared in relation to rural/urban living and with quantiles of area-level greenspace at three different neighbourhood distances: 800 m, 3000 m and 5000 m. Using microbiota data captured from faecal samples using 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing, small compositional differences in association with 3000 m greenspace (p = 0.003) in models adjusted for confounders of microbiota variance (sequencing depth, antibiotics use, body mass index, frailty, age, diet, region and socioeconomic variables) were observed.

34836148,Effect of Gut Microbial Enterotypes on the Association between Habitual Dietary Fiber Intake and Insulin Resistance Markers in Mexican Children and Adults.,"Dietary fiber (DF) is a major substrate for the gut microbiota that contributes to metabolic health. Recent studies have shown that diet-metabolic phenotype effect might be related to individual gut microbial profiles or enterotypes. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine whether microbial enterotypes modify the association between DF intake and metabolic traits. This cross-sectional study included 204 children (6-12 years old) and 75 adults (18-60 years old). Habitual DF intake was estimated with a Food Frequency Questionnaire and biochemical, clinical and anthropometric data were obtained. Gut microbiota was assessed through 16S sequencing and participants were stratified by enterotypes. Correlations adjusting for age and sex were performed to test the associations between dietary fiber components intake and metabolic traits. In children and adults from the <i>Prevotella</i> enterotype, a nominal negative correlation of hemicellulose intake with insulin and HOMA-IR levels was observed (<i>p</i> < 0.05), while in individuals of the other enterotypes, these associations were not observed. Interestingly, the latter effect was not related to the fecal short-chain-fatty acids profile. Our results contribute to understanding the enterotype influence on the diet-phenotype interaction, which ultimate could provide evidence for their use as potential biomarkers for future precision nutrition strategies.",Martinez-Medina JN; Flores-Lopez R; López-Contreras BE; Villamil-Ramirez H; Guzman-Muñoz D; Macias-Kauffer LR; León-Mimila P; Granados-Portillo O; Del-Rio-Navarro BE; Gómez-Perez FJ; Aguilar-Salinas CA; Torres N; Tovar AR; Canizales-Quinteros S; Moran-Ramos S,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34836148/,0,0,0,0,0,0

34763731,Metabolomics profiles of premenopausal women are different based on <i>O</i>-desmethylangolensin metabotype.,"Urinary <i>O</i>-desmethylangolensin (ODMA) concentrations provide a functional gut microbiome marker of dietary isoflavone daidzein metabolism to ODMA. Individuals who do not have gut microbial environments that produce ODMA have less favourable cardiometabolic and cancer risk profiles. Urinary metabolomics profiles were evaluated in relation to ODMA metabotypes within and between individuals over time. Secondary analysis of data was conducted from the BEAN2 trial, which was a cross-over study of premenopausal women consuming 6 months on a high and a low soya diet, each separated by a 1-month washout period. In all of the 672 samples in the study, sixty-six of the eighty-four women had the same ODMA metabotype at seven or all eight time points. Two or four urine samples per woman were selected based on temporal metabotypes in order to compare within and across individuals. Metabolomics assays for primary metabolism and biogenic amines were conducted in sixty urine samples from twenty women. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis was used to compare metabolomics profiles. For the same ODMA metabotype across different time points, no profile differences were detected. For changes in metabotype within individuals and across individuals with different metabotypes, distinct metabolomes emerged. Influential metabolites (variables importance in projection score > 2) included several phenolic compounds, carnitine and derivatives, fatty acid and amino acid metabolites and some medications. Based on the distinct metabolomes of producers <i>v</i>. non-producers, the ODMA metabotype may be a marker of gut microbiome functionality broadly involved in nutrient and bioactive metabolism and should be evaluated for relevance to precision nutrition initiatives.",Frankenfeld CL; Maskarinec G; Franke AA,The British journal of nutrition,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34763731/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Studies have suggested that the colonization of gut microbiota in early life is related to later food allergies. Still, the relationship between altered intestinal microbiota in adulthood and food allergies is unclear. (2) Methods: We established three mouse models to analyze gut microbiota dysbiosis' impact on the intestinal barrier and determine whether this effect can increase the susceptibility to and severity of food allergy in later life. (3) Results: The antibiotic-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis significantly reduced Lachnospiraceae, Muribaculaceae, and Ruminococcaceae, and increased Enterococcaceae and Clostridiales. At the same time, the metabolic abundance was changed, including decreased short-chain fatty acids and tryptophan, as well as enhanced purine. This change is related to food allergies. After gut microbiota dysbiosis, we sensitized the mice. The content of specific IgE and IgG1 in mice serum was significantly increased, and the inflammatory response was enhanced. The dysbiosis of gut microbiota caused the sensitized mice to have more severe allergic symptoms, ruptured intestinal villi, and a decrease in tight junction proteins (TJs) when re-exposed to the allergen. (4) Conclusions: Antibiotic-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis increases the susceptibility and severity of food allergies. This event may be due to the increased intestinal permeability caused by decreased intestinal tight junction proteins and the increased inflammatory response.",Zhang Q; Cheng L; Wang J; Hao M; Che H,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34684316/,0,0,0,0,0,0
34609363,THE PRESENT AND FUTURE OF PERSONALIZED NUTRITION.,"In recent decades, there has been an increase in the presence of metabolic disorders associated with obesity. Central in the treatment of these conditions, including abnormalities in glucose and lipid metabolism, dietary strategies play an important role. However, dietary recommendations are based on the generalization of nutrient or food intake response for all individuals, which not necessarily impacts the health of all individuals. The concept of personalized nutrition or precision nutrition has been recently developed, which states that diet is not the only factor accountable for metabolic responses such as postprandial glucose peaks, but that other factors are also involved, one of the most important of which is the gut microbiota. Therefore, the future of nutritional interventions is to generate algorithms based on the type of food consumed, biochemical parameters, physical activity, genetic variability, and especially the gut microbiota to predict the type of diet a person requires according to his or her metabolic alterations.",Torres N; Tovar AR,Revista de investigacion clinica; organo del Hospital de Enfermedades de la Nutricion,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34609363/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Significant progress has been made in identifying gut microbial features associated with a wide spectrum of human disease. However, other than a few microbiome-disease relations, there is a dearth of confirmed causal inferences, particularly in generally healthy populations. The relatively high unexplained variability in microbiome compositions in this group warrants caution in applying this complex biomarker toward precision nutrition, because our understanding of what constitutes a healthy microbiome is still rudimentary. Although gut microbiota harbor integrated environmental and host-specific information with the potential to facilitate personalized nutritional and lifestyle advice, these data cannot yet be confidently interpreted toward precise recommendations.

34373759,Milk-derived extracellular vesicles alleviate ulcerative colitis by regulating the gut immunity and reshaping the gut microbiota.,"<b>Rationale:</b> Bovine milk constitutes an essential part of human diet, especially for children, due to its enrichment of various nutrients. We recently developed an effective protocol for the isolation of extracellular vesicles from milk (mEVs) and discovered that mEVs contained large amounts of immune-active proteins and modulated the gut immunity and microbiota in healthy mice. Here, we aimed to explore the therapeutic effects of mEVs on inflammatory bowel disease. <b>Methods:</b> MicroRNAs and protein content in mEVs were analyzed by RNA sequencing and proteomics, respectively, followed by functional annotation. Ulcerative colitis (UC) was induced by feeding mice with dextran sulfate sodium. Intestinal immune cell populations were phenotyped by flow cytometry, and the gut microbiota was analyzed <i>via</i> 16S rRNA sequencing. <b>Results:</b> We showed that abundant proteins and microRNAs in mEVs were involved in the regulation of immune and inflammatory pathways and that oral administration of mEVs prevented colon shortening, reduced intestinal epithelium disruption, inhibited infiltration of inflammatory cells and tissue fibrosis in a mouse UC model. Mechanistically, mEVs attenuated inflammatory response <i>via</i> inhibiting TLR4-NF-κB signaling pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Furthermore, mEVs were able to correct cytokine production disorder and restore the balance between T helper type 17 (Th17) cells and interleukin-10<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T (Treg) cells in the inflamed colon. The disturbed gut microbiota in UC was also partially recovered upon treatment with mEVs. The correlation between the gut microbiota and cytokines suggests that mEVs may modulate intestinal immunity <i>via</i> influencing the gut microbiota. <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings reveal that mEVs alleviate colitis by regulating intestinal immune homeostasis <i>via</i> inhibiting TLR4-NF-κB and NLRP3 signaling pathways, restoring Treg/Th17 cell balance, and reshaping the gut microbiota.",Tong L; Hao H; Zhang Z; Lv Y; Liang X; Liu Q; Liu T; Gong P; Zhang L; Cao F; Pastorin G; Lee CN; Chen X; Wang JW; Yi H,Theranostics,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34373759/,0,0,0,0,0,0
34065444,Gut Microbiota Induced by Pterostilbene and Resveratrol in High-Fat-High-Fructose Fed Rats: Putative Role in Steatohepatitis Onset.,"Resveratrol and its 2-methoxy derivative pterostilbene are two phenolic compounds that occur in foodstuffs and feature hepato-protective effects. This study is devoted to analysing and comparing the metabolic effects of pterostilbene and resveratrol on gut microbiota composition in rats displaying NAFLD induced by a diet rich in saturated fat and fructose. The associations among changes induced by both phenolic compounds in liver status and those induced in gut microbiota composition were also analysed. For this purpose, fifty Wistar rats were distributed in five experimental groups: a group of animals fed a standard diet (CC group) and four additional groups fed a high-fat high-fructose diet alone (HFHF group) or supplemented with 15 or 30 mg/kg bw/d of pterostilbene (PT15 and PT30 groups, respectively) or 30 mg/kg bw/d of resveratrol (RSV30 group). The dramatic changes induced by high-fat high-fructose feeding in the gut microbiota were poorly ameliorated by pterostilbene or resveratrol. These results suggest that the specific changes in microbiota composition induced by pterostilbene (increased abundances of <i>Akkermansia</i> and <i>Erysipelatoclostridium</i>, and lowered abundance of <i>Clostridum</i> sensu stricto 1) may not entirely explain the putative preventive effects on steatohepatitis.",Milton-Laskibar I; Marcos-Zambrano LJ; Gómez-Zorita S; Fernández-Quintela A; Carrillo de Santa Pau E; Martínez JA; Portillo MP,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34065444/,0,0,0,0,0,0
33811477,Multiomic Predictors of Short-Term Weight Loss and Clinical Outcomes During a Behavioral-Based Weight Loss Intervention.,"Identifying predictors of weight loss and clinical outcomes may increase understanding of individual variability in weight loss response. We hypothesized that baseline multiomic features, including DNA methylation (DNAme), metabolomics, and gut microbiome, would be predictive of short-term changes in body weight and other clinical outcomes within a comprehensive weight loss intervention. Healthy adults with overweight or obesity (n = 62, age 18-55 years, BMI 27-45 kg/m<sup>2</sup> , 75.8% female) participated in a 1-year behavioral weight loss intervention. To identify baseline omic predictors of changes in clinical outcomes at 3 and 6 months, whole-blood DNAme, plasma metabolites, and gut microbial genera were analyzed. A network of multiomic relationships informed predictive models for 10 clinical outcomes (body weight, waist circumference, fat mass, hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> , homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, total cholesterol, triglycerides, C-reactive protein, leptin, and ghrelin) that changed significantly (P < 0.05). For eight of these, adjusted R<sup>2</sup> ranged from 0.34 to 0.78. Our models identified specific DNAme sites, gut microbes, and metabolites that were predictive of variability in weight loss, waist circumference, and circulating triglycerides and that are biologically relevant to obesity and metabolic pathways.

33753486,CODY enables quantitatively spatiotemporal predictions on in vivo gut microbial variability induced by diet intervention.,"Microbial variations in the human gut are harbored in temporal and spatial heterogeneity, and quantitative prediction of spatiotemporal dynamic changes in the gut microbiota is imperative for development of tailored microbiome-directed therapeutics treatments, e.g. precision nutrition. Given the high-degree complexity of microbial variations, subject to the dynamic interactions among host, microbial, and environmental factors, identifying how microbiota colonize in the gut represents an important challenge. Here we present COmputing the DYnamics of microbiota (CODY), a multiscale framework that integrates species-level modeling of microbial dynamics and ecosystem-level interactions into a mathematical model that characterizes spatial-specific in vivo microbial residence in the colon as impacted by host physiology. The framework quantifies spatiotemporal resolution of microbial variations on species-level abundance profiles across site-specific colon regions and in feces, independent of a priori knowledge. We demonstrated the effectiveness of CODY using cross-sectional data from two longitudinal metagenomics studies-the microbiota development during early infancy and during short-term diet intervention of obese adults. For each cohort, CODY correctly predicts the microbial variations in response to diet intervention, as validated by available metagenomics and metabolomics data. Model simulations provide insight into the biogeographical heterogeneity among lumen, mucus, and feces, which provides insight into how host physical forces and spatial structure are shaping microbial structure and functionality.",Geng J; Ji B; Li G; López-Isunza F; Nielsen J,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33753486/,0,0,0,0,0,1

Current microbiome studies generate high-throughput omics data across different body sites, populations, and life stages. Many of the challenges in microbiome research are similar to other high-throughput studies, the quantitative analyses need to address the heterogeneity of data, specific statistical properties, and the remarkable variation in microbiome composition across individuals and body sites. This has led to a broad spectrum of statistical and machine learning challenges that range from study design, data processing, and standardization to analysis, modeling, cross-study comparison, prediction, data science ecosystems, and reproducible reporting. Nevertheless, although many statistics and machine learning approaches and tools have been developed, new techniques are needed to deal with emerging applications and the vast heterogeneity of microbiome data. We review and discuss emerging applications of statistical and machine learning techniques in human microbiome studies and introduce the COST Action CA18131 ""ML4Microbiome"" that brings together microbiome researchers and machine learning experts to address current challenges such as standardization of analysis pipelines for reproducibility of data analysis results, benchmarking, improvement, or development of existing and new tools and ontologies.",Moreno-Indias I; Lahti L; Nedyalkova M; Elbere I; Roshchupkin G; Adilovic M; Aydemir O; Bakir-Gungor B; Santa Pau EC; D'Elia D; Desai MS; Falquet L; Gundogdu A; Hron K; Klammsteiner T; Lopes MB; Marcos-Zambrano LJ; Marques C; Mason M; May P; Pašić L; Pio G; Pongor S; Promponas VJ; Przymus P; Saez-Rodriguez J; Sampri A; Shigdel R; Stres B; Suharoschi R; Truu J; Truică CO; Vilne B; Vlachakis D; Yilmaz E; Zeller G; Zomer AL; Gómez-Cabrero D; Claesson MJ,Frontiers in microbiology,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33692771/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Here, we demonstrate that a healthy Mediterranean-style dietary pattern is associated with specific functional and taxonomic components of the gut microbiome, and that its protective associations with cardiometabolic health vary depending on microbial composition. In particular, the protective association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and cardiometabolic disease risk was significantly stronger among participants with decreased abundance of Prevotella copri.

33515003,Maternal gut microbiota reflecting poor diet quality is associated with spontaneous preterm birth in a prospective cohort study.,"A processed diet, high in fat and low in fiber, is associated with differences in the gut microbiota and adverse health outcomes in humans; however, little is known about the diet-microbiota relation and its impact on pregnancy. Spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB), a pregnancy outcome with serious short- and long-term consequences, occurs more frequently in black and in obese women in the United States. In a prospective, case-control sample matched for race and obesity (cases = 16, controls = 32), we compared the fecal gut microbiota, fecal and plasma metabolites, and diet in the late second trimester. We hypothesized that a Western diet would be associated with reduced microbiota richness and a metabolic signature predicting incidence of SPTB. The fecal microbiota was characterized by 16S-tagged sequencing and untargeted metabolomics was used to analyze both plasma and fecal metabolites. Wilcoxon's rank-sum test was used for the comparison of microbiota genera, α-diversity, fecal and plasma metabolites, and dietary variables between term and SPTB. β-Diversity was analyzed using permutational multivariate ANOVA, and metabolite associations were assessed by module analysis. A decrease in α-diversity was strongly associated with the development of SPTB, especially in the taxonomic class of Betaproteobacteria. Of 824 fecal metabolites, 22 metabolites (mostly lipids) differed between cases and controls (P < 0.01), with greater DHA (22:6n-3) and EPA (20:5n-3) in cases [false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.2]. The most significant fecal metabolite module (FDR-adjusted P = 0.008) was dominated by DHA and EPA. Dietary saturated fat (primarily palmitate) intake was greater in cases (31.38 ± 7.37 compared with 26.08 ± 8.62 g, P = 0.045) and was positively correlated with fecal DHA and EPA (P < 0.05). Reduced α-diversity of the gut microbiota and higher excretion of omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids in stool may provide a novel biomarker signature predicting SPTB in women with a low-fiber, high-fat diet.

One of these concerning body composition (in this context; bone, lean and adipose tissue) is osteosarcopenic adiposity (OSA) syndrome. OSA occurs most often with aging, but also in cases of some chronic diseases and is exacerbated with the presence of low-grade chronic inflammation (LGCI). OSA has been associated with poor nutrition, metabolic disorders and diminished functional abilities. This paper addresses various influences on OSA and LGCI, as well as their mutual action on each other, and provides nutritional and behavioral approaches which could be personalized to help with either preventing or managing OSA and LGCI in general, and specifically in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Addressed in more detail are nutritional recommendations for and roles of macro- and micronutrients and bioactive food components; the microbiome; and optimal physical activity regimens. Other issues, such as food insecurity and nutritional inadequacy, circadian misalignment and shift workers are addressed as well.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of MFGM supplementation in infant formula on intestinal epithelium maturation, tight junctions, and gut colonization in rat pups. Sprague Dawley rat pups consume one of the five diets from postnatal day 8, including rat breastfeeding (BF), infant formula (IF), and infant formula containing MFGM at 260 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> body weight (BW), 520 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> BW, or 1040 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> BW. Results show that MFGM supplementation in infant formula can facilitate intestinal mucosal barrier maturation via promoting intestinal proliferation and differentiation, and increasing tight junction proteins. In addition, compared with that of the IF pups, the intestinal flora composition of MFGM-supplemented pups is more similar to that of BF pups. MFGM supplementation in infant formula can restore the intestinal development in infant-formula-fed pups, which suggests that the supplementation of MFGM in infant formula can better mimic breast milk.",Gong H; Yuan Q; Pang J; Li T; Li J; Zhan B; Chang R; Mao X,Molecular nutrition & food research,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32918844/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Changes in the microbiome composition during <i>Baijiu</i> production have been examined previously; however, the respective metabolic functions remain unclear. Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and metabolomics, we examined the microbial and metabolic characteristics during light-flavor <i>Baijiu</i> fermentation to assess the correlations between microorganisms and their potential functions. During fermentation, the bacterial abundance increased from 58.2% to 97.65%, and fermentation resulted in the accumulation of various metabolites, among which alcohols and esters were the most abundant. Correlation analyses revealed that the levels of major metabolites were positively correlated with bacterial abundance but negatively with that of fungi. Gene annotation showed that the <i>Lactobacillus</i> species contained key enzyme genes for carbohydrate metabolism and contributed to the entire fermentation process. <i>Lichtheimia ramosa, Saccharomycopsis fibuligera, Bacillus licheniformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</i> and <i>Pichia kudriavzevii</i> play major roles in starch degradation and ethanol production.

A total of 480 shrimps with an average initial body weight of 0.35 ± 0.002 g were randomly distributed into twelve tanks. Three isonitrogenous (40.00 crude protein) and isolipidic (8.00 crude lipids) diets with yeast culture supplementing fishmeal were formulated. The groups were divided into two (2) namely control group and experimental groups. The formulations of the groups were control (0 %, without yeast culture) and the experiment groups (SYC) [(1 % of yeast culture), and (2 % of yeast culture)]. Each diet was delivered in four replicate per treatment group. The results indicate significant improvement on the growth indices (specific growth rate, weight gain rate, survival rate and lower feed conversion ratio) with yeast culture treatment group after 56 days feeding trials (P < 0.05). Total hemolymph protein, superoxide dismutase, catalase, alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase, lysozyme and phenoxidase were enhanced but low aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and glucose were observed in shrimp fed yeast culture diets (P < 0.05). The SYC groups showed insignificant differences in hemolymph cholesterol and triglyceride. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria were the dominant bacteria found in all the SYC groups. At the genus level, Vibrio was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in 2 % yeast culture diets supplemented group whereas the beneficial bacteria Pseudoalteromonas was significantly enhanced. Moreover, intestinal villus length and width in shrimps fed yeast culture diets were improved (P < 0.05).

32580458,Sex-Specific Associations between Gut Prevotellaceae and Host Genetics on Adiposity.,"The gut microbiome has been recognized as a tool for understanding adiposity accumulation and for providing personalized nutrition advice for the management of obesity and accompanying metabolic complications. The genetic background is also involved in human energy homeostasis. In order to increase the value of nutrigenetic dietary advice, the interplay between genetics and microbiota must be investigated. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate interactive associations between gut microbiota composition and 95 obesity-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) searched in the literature. Oral mucosa and fecal samples from 360 normal weight, overweight and obese subjects were collected. Next generation genotyping of these 95 SNPs and fecal 16S rRNA sequencing were performed. A genetic risk score (GRS) was constructed with 10 SNPs statistically or marginally associated with body mass index (BMI). Several microbiome statistical analyses at family taxonomic level were applied (LEfSe, Canonical Correspondence Analysis, MetagenomeSeq and Random Forest), and Prevotellaceae family was found in all of them as one of the most important bacterial families associated with BMI and GRS. Thus, in this family it was further analyzed the interactive association between BMI and GRS with linear regression models. Interestingly, women with higher abundance of Prevotellaceae and higher GRS were more obese, compared to women with higher GRS and lower abundance of Prevotellaceae. These findings suggest relevant interrelationships between Prevotellaceae and the genetic background that may determine interindividual BMI differences in women, which opens the way to new precision nutrition-based treatments for obesity.",Cuevas-Sierra A; Riezu-Boj JI; Guruceaga E; Milagro FI; Martínez JA,Microorganisms,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32580458/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Person-specific factors, such as gut microbiome, had a greater influence (7.1% of variance) than did meal macronutrients (3.6%) for postprandial lipemia, but not for postprandial glycemia (6.0% and 15.4%, respectively); genetic variants had a modest impact on predictions (9.5% for glucose, 0.8% for triglyceride, 0.2% for C-peptide). Findings were independently validated in a US cohort (n = 100 people). We developed a machine-learning model that predicted both triglyceride (r = 0.47) and glycemic (r = 0.77) responses to food intake. These findings may be informative for developing personalized diet strategies.

32039173,<i>Marigold Supercritical Extract</i> as Potential Co-adjuvant in Pancreatic Cancer: The Energetic Catastrophe Induced via BMP8B Ends Up With Autophagy-Induced Cell Death.,"The recent development of powerful ""omics"" technologies (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics) has opened new avenues in nutritional sciences toward precision nutrition, which is a genotype-directed nutrition that takes into account the differential responses to nutritional interventions based on gene variation (nutrigenetics) and the effect of nutrients on gene expression (nutrigenomics). Current evidence demonstrates that up to one third of the deaths caused by cancer could be prevented by acting on key risk factors, with diet being one of the most important risk factors due to its association with obesity. Additional factors such as composition of gut microbiome, the immune system, and the nutritional status will have an impact on the final outcome. Nutrient components and bioactive compounds from natural sources can have an impact on cancer progression or even the risk of cancer development by regulating gene expression and/or associated risk factors such as obesity and chronic inflammation. Nowadays, among the different methods to produce natural extracts, the green technology of supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) is quite popular, with a special interest on the use of supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> for the extraction of compounds with low polarity. The success of nutritional interventions based on the use of nutraceuticals requires several steps: (i) <i>in vitro</i> and preclinical demonstration of their antitumoral effects; (ii) knowledge of their mechanism of action and molecular targets, which will allow for identification of the specific subgroups of patients who will benefit from them; (iii) the study of genetic variants associated with the differential responses; and (iv) innovative approaches of formulations to improve the <i>in vivo</i> bioavailability of the bioactive ingredients. Herein, we investigate the antitumoral properties and mechanism of action of a supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> extract from <i>Calendula officinalis</i>, commonly known as marigold (marigold SFE) in the context of pancreatic cancer. Mechanistically, marigold SFE induces the expression of BMP8B, which leads to an energetic catastrophe ending up with autophagy-induced cell death (AICD). As metabolic reprogramming is a well-recognized hallmark of cancer, the direct impact of marigold SFE on pancreatic cancer cell metabolism encourages further research of its potential as a coadjuvant in pancreatic cancer therapy. Finally, we discuss innovative formulation approaches to augment the clinical therapeutic potential of marigold SFE in nutritional interventions.",Gómez de Cedrón M; Mouhid L; García-Carrascosa E; Fornari T; Reglero G; Ramírez de Molina A,Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32039173/,0,0,0,0,0,0
31728495,"Plant-Based Diets for Personal, Population, and Planetary Health.","Worldwide, the burden of morbidity and mortality from diet-related chronic diseases is increasing, driven by poor diet quality and overconsumption of calories. At the same time, the global food production system is draining our planet's resources, jeopardizing the environment and future food security. Personal, population, and planetary health are closely intertwined and will all continue to be vulnerable to these threats unless action is taken. Fortunately, shifting current global dietary patterns towards high-quality, plant-based diets could alleviate these health and environmental burdens. Compared with typical Western diets with high amounts of animal products, healthy plant-based diets are not only more sustainable, but have also been associated with lower risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers. For personalized disease management and prevention, precision nutrition has the potential to offer more effective approaches tailored to individual characteristics such as the genome, metabolome, and microbiome. However, this area of research is in the early stages and is not yet ready for widespread clinical use. Therefore, it must not overshadow public health nutrition strategies, which have the power to improve health and sustainability on a larger scale. If widely implemented, interventions and policy changes that shift the globe towards healthy plant-based dietary patterns could be instrumental in ensuring future personal, population, and planetary health.",Hemler EC; Hu FB,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31728495/,0,0,0,0,0,0
31504115,Perspective: Guiding Principles for the Implementation of Personalized Nutrition Approaches That Benefit Health and Function.,"Personalized nutrition (PN) approaches have been shown to help drive behavior change and positively influence health outcomes. This has led to an increase in the development of commercially available PN programs, which utilize various forms of individual-level information to provide services and products for consumers. The lack of a well-accepted definition of PN or an established set of guiding principles for the implementation of PN creates barriers for establishing credibility and efficacy. To address these points, the North American Branch of the International Life Sciences Institute convened a multidisciplinary panel. In this article, a definition for PN is proposed: ""Personalized nutrition uses individual-specific information, founded in evidence-based science, to promote dietary behavior change that may result in measurable health benefits."" In addition, 10 guiding principles for PN approaches are proposed: 1) define potential users and beneficiaries; 2) use validated diagnostic methods and measures; 3) maintain data quality and relevance; 4) derive data-driven recommendations from validated models and algorithms; 5) design PN studies around validated individual health or function needs and outcomes; 6) provide rigorous scientific evidence for an effect on health or function; 7) deliver user-friendly tools; 8) for healthy individuals, align with population-based recommendations; 9) communicate transparently about potential effects; and 10) protect individual data privacy and act responsibly. These principles are intended to establish a basis for responsible approaches to the evidence-based research and practice of PN and serve as an invitation for further public dialog. Several challenges were identified for PN to continue gaining acceptance, including defining the health-disease continuum, identification of biomarkers, changing regulatory landscapes, accessibility, and measuring success. Although PN approaches hold promise for public health in the future, further research is needed on the accuracy of dietary intake measurement, utilization and standardization of systems approaches, and application and communication of evidence.",Adams SH; Anthony JC; Carvajal R; Chae L; Khoo CSH; Latulippe ME; Matusheski NV; McClung HL; Rozga M; Schmid CH; Wopereis S; Yan W,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31504115/,0,0,0,0,0,0
31461505,"Dietary inulin alters the gut microbiome, enhances systemic metabolism and reduces neuroinflammation in an APOE4 mouse model.","The apolipoprotein ε4 allele (APOE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). APOE4 carriers develop systemic metabolic dysfunction decades before showing AD symptoms. Accumulating evidence shows that the metabolic dysfunction accelerates AD development, including exacerbated amyloid-beta (Aβ) retention, neuroinflammation and cognitive decline. Therefore, preserving metabolic function early on may be critical to reducing the risk for AD. Here, we show that inulin increases beneficial microbiota and decreases harmful microbiota in the feces of young, asymptomatic APOE4 transgenic (E4FAD) mice and enhances metabolism in the cecum, periphery and brain, as demonstrated by increases in the levels of SCFAs, tryptophan-derived metabolites, bile acids, glycolytic metabolites and scyllo-inositol. We show that inulin also reduces inflammatory gene expression in the hippocampus. This knowledge can be utilized to design early precision nutrition intervention strategies that use a prebiotic diet to enhance systemic metabolism and may be useful for reducing AD risk in asymptomatic APOE4 carriers.",Hoffman JD; Yanckello LM; Chlipala G; Hammond TC; McCulloch SD; Parikh I; Sun S; Morganti JM; Green SJ; Lin AL,PloS one,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31461505/,0,0,0,0,0,0
31117266,A Pilot Study on Anti-Obesity Mechanisms of <i>Kappaphycus</i> <i>Alvarezii</i>: The Role of Native κ-Carrageenan and the Leftover Sans-Carrageenan Fraction.,"<i>Kappaphycus</i> is a commercially important edible red alga widely cultivated for carrageenan production. Here, we aimed to investigate the anti-obesity mechanism of <i>Kappaphycus</i> <i>alvarezii</i> by comparing the effects of whole seaweed (T), extracted native κ-carrageenan (CGN), and the leftover fraction sans-carrageenan (SCGN) supplementations (5%, <i>w</i>/<i>w</i>) on diet-induced obese C57BL/6J mice. A high-fat diet induced both a raised body fat percentage and serum cholesterol level, increased adipocytes size, abnormal levels of adipocytokines, and promoted gut dysbiosis. Our results showed that, overall, both CGN and SCGN were more effective in reversing obesity and related metabolic syndromes to normal levels than T. Furthermore, these findings suggested that CGN- and SCGN-modulated gut dysbiosis induced by a high-fat diet, which may play an influencing role in adiponectin dysregulation. Our data also showed some evidence that CGN and SCGN have distinct effects on selected genes involved in lipid metabolism. In conclusion, both κ-carrageenan and SCGN have novel anti-obesity potential with possible different mechanisms of action.",Chin YX; Mi Y; Cao WX; Lim PE; Xue CH; Tang QJ,Nutrients,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31117266/,0,0,0,0,0,0
30936893,A Conceptual Framework for Studying and Investing in Precision Nutrition.,"Nutrients and food-derived bioactive molecules must transit complex metabolic pathways, and these pathways vary between people.
