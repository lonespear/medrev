41696692,Infectious disease burden and surveillance challenges in Jordan and Palestine: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Jordan and Palestine face public health challenges due to infectious diseases, with the added detrimental factors of long-term conflict, forced relocation, and lack of resources. Added to these are the increased rates of morbidity and mortality from having limited healthcare services available due to a lack of funding, poor disease surveillance systems, and entrenched systemic weaknesses. The purpose of this systematic review was to report the prevalence of infectious diseases in Jordan and Palestine in order to inform the development of targeted public health programs that use both standard and novel approaches to reduce the region's disease burden. As defined by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, the review included prospective, retrospective, cross-sectional, and case series studies published from January 2021 to February 2024. Non-English studies were excluded due to resource limitations, as were studies published before the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., before January 2021) to focus on post-COVID-19-pandemic trends. We used diagnostic techniques (screening, laboratory, and confirmatory tests) to test for microorganisms in adults and children from at-risk populations in Jordan and Palestine. Test-negative controls were contrasted with patients who had positive test results. A manual reference screening process was added to a systematic search of PubMed and Scopus. Full-text, English-language publications published after January 2021 were eligible; protocols, reviews, case reports, and articles written in languages other than English were not. The Rayyan platform was used by two reviewers to independently screen studies. Infection type, causative microorganism, symptoms, mortality, risk factors, seasonal fluctuations, and study details (author, year, location, design, and participant characteristics) were among the extracted data. The Hoy 2012 Checklist was used to evaluate the risk of bias. Open Meta (Analyst) was used to analyze the 13 studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria. Study design, risk of bias, heterogeneity, publication bias, indirection, imprecision, effect size, and residual confounding were all considered when grading the quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The results revealed that four studies addressed the prevalence of <i>Brucella</i> infection in Jordan and Palestine. The pooled estimate was 42.2% (95% CI: 18.8%-65.6%, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup>: 99.7%, <i>P:</i> 0.001, <i>n</i> = 4 studies, 4,483 patients). In the studies that addressed diarrhea, in 31 of 159 (19.5%) cases, 20 were caused by <i>Entamoeba</i> (12.6%), 10 were caused by <i>Blastocystis</i> (6.3%), and 1 (0.6%) was caused by <i>Cryptosporidium</i>. As some cases had more than one parasite, the certainty of evidence (COE) was assessed as very low. The pooled estimate for viral causative agents of respiratory tract infections was 60% (95% CI: 11.8%-100%), while for bacterial causes, the pooled estimate was 24.4% (95% CI: 0%-68.3%). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most common agent, with a pooled estimate of 57.9% (95% CI: 29.8%-85.9%), while influenza had a pooled estimate of 28.4% (95% CI: 5.3%-51.5%). Furthermore, two studies addressed the prevalence of meningitis in pediatric patients. In adult patients, of 192 patients known to have meningitis, a causative agent was identified in only 86 cases, with 83 (49%) classified as aseptic meningitis. The review addressed the limitations of diagnostic capacity, reporting systems, and population-level data concerning high-burden and emerging pathogens within Jordan and Palestine. Specifically, the growth in the number of cases with respiratory tract infections, protozoal diarrheal diseases, and brucellosis indicates that improvements in surveillance systems and diagnostic processes need to be standardized and implemented throughout Jordan and Palestine to provide accurate and reliable diagnoses. In addition, improving the quality and quantity of the data and incorporating new technologies and other innovative approaches as a complement to existing public health indicators within Jordan and Palestine would be beneficial for better detecting these diseases at the earliest possible time and would provide the opportunity to establish evidence-based disease management strategies within the region.",Badran EF; Rayyan A; Al Jaberi M; Azzam M; Ramadan R; Khader Y; Alqutob R; Bakri FG; Qasrawi R; Yacoub T; Sharaqa A; Fraihat N; Trigui H; Sokhn E; Tayyem R; Musa E; Kong JD,Frontiers in digital health,2026,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41696692/,1,0,0,0,0,0

41606937,Recent advances in electrochemical-based CRISPR/Cas biosensing for nucleic acid and non-nucleic acid pathogenic microorganism detection.,"The widespread presence of pathogenic microorganisms in food and environmental sources poses a persistent threat to public health. Conventional detection methods-including culture, microscopy, and biochemical assays-are limited by low sensitivity, cross-reactivity, and prolonged turnaround times, particularly when microbial loads are low or phenotypic overlap occurs. These limitations underscore the urgent need for diagnostic platforms that combine speed, specificity, and sensitivity. The advent of CRISPR/Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/CRISPR-associated) systems has revolutionized microbial diagnostics, driving the emergence of electrochemical CRISPR/Cas (EC-CRISPR/Cas) biosensors. This review surveys four principal electrochemical CRISPR/Cas (EC-CRISPR/Cas) platforms-Cas9, Cas12a, Cas13a, and Cas14a-emphasizing their structural characteristics, biosensing mechanisms, and signal amplification strategies for both nucleic acid and non-nucleic acid pathogen detection. We first outline the molecular architecture and functional mechanisms of each Cas protein in the context of biosensing. EC-CRISPR/Cas detection strategies are classified as nucleic acid-based (either amplification-free or amplification-dependent) or non-nucleic acid-based, the latter primarily relying on aptamer-mediated recognition. We also provide a comparative analysis of signal enhancement techniques and application scenarios across bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic pathogens. Importantly, we identify key limitations of current systems-such as poor reusability, signal drift, and challenges in point-of-care deployment-and present emerging solutions including crRNA engineering, nanomaterial integration, and artificial intelligence-guided biosensor design. These innovations hold strong potential to enhance sensitivity, specificity, and real-time performance, offering a foundation for next-generation, scalable EC-CRISPR/Cas diagnostics.",Jiang W; Zhu T; Zhou S; Pan L; Qiao Z; Wang M; Yang D,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41606937/,1,0,0,0,0,0

41482234,"Integrating Nuclear Techniques, Isotopic Tracing, Omics, and Artificial Intelligence in Nutritional Systems for Advancing Precision Public Health Nutrition.","Understanding the complex interplay between diet, nutrient metabolism, and chronic disease risk is central to advancing precision public health nutrition. Conventional dietary assessments often fail to capture the biochemical and interindividual variability necessary for mechanistic interpretation and the development of personalized nutritional interventions. Recent advances in nuclear techniques, particularly stable isotope tracing, combined with multi-omics technologies and artificial intelligence (AI), provide a transformative framework for high-resolution nutritional analysis. This review critically synthesized these interdisciplinary innovations, highlighting how the integration of stable isotope methodologies, omics platforms-including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics-and AI-driven data analytics enables dynamic, quantitative mapping of nutrient metabolism and gene-diet interactions. Stable isotope tracers offer in vivo precision for measuring nutrient absorption, bioavailability, and metabolic fluxes; omics platforms elucidate molecular responses to dietary exposures; and AI enhances data harmonization, causal inference, and predictive modeling. Together, these approaches support biomarker discovery, personalized nutrition, and population-level dietary interventions targeting both malnutrition and non-communicable diseases. We propose the Nutritional Systems Integration framework, which operationalizes isotope-omics-AI convergence to inform evidence-based, adaptive nutrition policies. This systems-driven paradigm establishes feedback loops connecting research, clinical application, and public health strategy-advancing global goals in food security, health equity, and disease prevention. Embracing such integrative methodologies can transform nutrition science from descriptive epidemiology into predictive, precision-based solutions for sustainable and equitable health outcomes.",Bhuiyan MNI,The Journal of nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41482234/,1,0,0,0,0,0

However, their native forms often suffer from limitations such as poor mechanical strength, thermal instability and rapid enzymatic degradation, which hinder broader industrial applications. This review critically examines recent advances in emerging modification techniques such as high-pressure processing, microwave treatment and cold plasma, etc., for enhancing the structural and functional properties of polysaccharides. Influence of modifications on rheological behavior, emulsification, hydrophobicity and gelation capacity were addressed, enabling advanced applications such as 3D-printing, plant-based meat structuring and controlled bioactive delivery. Special attention is given to green and sustainable modification strategies especially valorization of agri-food waste. Furthermore, the emerging role of artificial intelligence (AI) and molecular dynamics in predicting structure-function relationships are discussed, paving the way for data-driven design of polysaccharide-based materials. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in integrating modification techniques across disciplines and understanding their interactions within real food matrices.

41473198,Can artificial intelligence uncover the bioactive peptides' benefits for human health and knowledge? A narrative review.,"The intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and food science has opened new frontiers in understanding the ""dark matter"" of food, the vast array of unidentified bioactive compounds that influence human health. This narrative review examines how AI, particularly machine learning and deep learning, is revolutionizing the discovery, characterization, and application of bioactive peptides and amino acids derived from food sources, both plant- and animal-based. These compounds exhibit diverse health benefits, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, and antimicrobial properties, yet their complexity and the limitations of traditional methods have hindered comprehensive study. AI-driven approaches, such as predictive modeling, molecular dynamics simulations, and natural language processing, are accelerating the identification of bioactive peptides, optimizing extraction processes, and enabling personalized nutrition strategies. The integration of AI with omics technologies (e.g., nutrigenomics, proteomics) further enhances our understanding of how these peptides modulate physiological pathways. However, this is not without challenges and limitations, such as data quality, model interpretability, and persistent gaps in interdisciplinary collaboration. Additionally, the review highlights the lack of standardized databases and concerns about the use of AI, including the need for ethical approvals and protocols aligned with privacy laws, particularly in the context of personalized nutrition guidance. This review synthesizes current advancements, identifies research gaps, and underscores the transformative potential of AI in functional food development and precision nutrition. By addressing these challenges, AI can unlock the full therapeutic potential of food-derived bioactive compounds, providing innovative solutions to global health challenges such as non-communicable diseases. The findings advocate for robust interdisciplinary efforts to bridge computational and nutritional sciences, paving the way for scalable, evidence-based applications in health and wellness.",Al Shareef R; Fathelrahman E; Osman R; Gebiso T; Platat C,Frontiers in nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41473198/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41470837,Application of Augmented Reality Technology as a Dietary Monitoring and Control Measure Among Adults: A Systematic Review.,"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Traditional dietary monitoring methods such as 24 h recalls rely on self-report, leading to recall bias and underreporting. Similarly, dietary control approaches, including portion control and calorie restriction, depend on user accuracy and consistency. Augmented reality (AR) offers a promising alternative for improving dietary monitoring and control by enhancing engagement, feedback accuracy, and user learning. This systematic review aimed to examine how AR technologies are implemented to support dietary monitoring and control and to evaluate their usability and effectiveness among adults. <b>Methods</b>: A systematic search of PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase identified studies published between 2000 and 2025 that evaluated augmented reality for dietary monitoring and control among adults. Eligible studies included peer-reviewed and gray literature in English. Data extraction focused on study design, AR system type, usability, and effectiveness outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool for randomized controlled trials and ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies. <b>Results</b>: Thirteen studies met inclusion criteria. Since the evidence based was heterogeneous in design, outcomes, and measurement, findings were synthesized qualitatively rather than pooled. Most studies utilized smartphone-based AR systems for portion size estimation, nutrition education, and behavior modification. Usability and satisfaction varied by study: One study found that 80% of participants (N = 15) were satisfied or extremely satisfied with the AR tool. Another reported that 100% of users (N = 26) rated the app easy to use, and a separate study observed a 72.5% agreement rate on ease of use among participants (N = 40). Several studies also examined portion size estimation, with one reporting a 12.2% improvement in estimation accuracy and another showing -6% estimation, though a 12.7% overestimation in energy intake persisted. Additional outcomes related to behavior, dietary knowledge, and physiological or psychological effects were also identified across the review. Common limitations included difficulty aligning markers, overestimation of amorphous foods, and short intervention durations. Despite these promising findings, the existing evidence is limited by small sample sizes, heterogeneity in intervention and device design, short study durations, and variability in usability and accuracy measures. The limitations of this review warrant cautious interpretation of findings. <b>Conclusions</b>: AR technologies show promise for improving dietary monitoring and control by enhancing accuracy, engagement, and behavior change. Future research should focus on longitudinal designs, diverse populations, and integration with multimodal sensors and artificial intelligence.",Gonzalez GV; Mao B; Wang R; Liu W; Wang C; Tseng TS,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41470837/,0,1,0,0,0,1
41469916,Stem cell therapy for patients with acute myocardial infarction: a systematic review of clinical trials.,"Stem cell therapy has emerged as a potential regenerative approach for Acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Despite decades of research and advancement in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) management, translating innovative therapies from bench to bedside remains a central challenge. Nonetheless, clinical outcomes exhibit considerable variability. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the clinical landscape of stem cell therapy for AMI, specifically focusing on how variations in cell type, delivery timing, routes, and dosages can affect cell therapy efficacy. This study is a systematic review of randomized clinical trials. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed, and the study was conducted in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. After searching the relevant databases, a total of 5276 studies were assessed, and 43 trials were considered eligible for inclusion in the present systematic review. The safety and efficacy of various types of stem cells, including bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), cardiac progenitor cells, and, more recently, induced pluripotent stem cells, have been evaluated in numerous clinical trials and meta-analyses. Among these, BM-MNCs and MSCs have been the most extensively studied. Although results vary from trial to trial and can even be contradictory, from frank failures to monumental achievements, overall, the evidence supports modest but statistically significant improvements in surrogate endpoints, such as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), ventricular remodeling, and reduced infarct size. We have critically reviewed how methodological approaches-especially the definitions of endpoints and clinical outcome measures-have significantly influenced the reported efficacy and direction of the field. The interpretation of clinical trial results in cell therapy for AMI is heavily impacted by the specific metrics used to define success. A key focus is distinguishing between clinical trials on patients with acute and recent myocardial infarction (which is the main focus of this review) and those with chronic ischemic or non-ischemic cardiomyopathies, as they involve different treatment strategies. Patient selection is essential for improving responses in patients with AMI. Those with a severely reduced LVEF (LVEF < 40%) and younger age tend to benefit more. Limiting the transplantation window to the first 3-7 days after AMI may improve the intervention's effectiveness.",Mahram H; Khalafi V; Arman A; Mirhosseini SA; Hosseinpour A; Khani Jeihooni A; Attar A,Stem cell research & therapy,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41469916/,1,1,0,0,0,0
41467232,Clinical Value of Nutritional Assessment Tools in Older Adults with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: An Integrative Review.,"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressive respiratory disorder frequently observed in older adults and is often accompanied by aging-related conditions such as sarcopenia, cognitive impairment, and immune dysfunction. Malnutrition is a major yet underrecognized contributor to poor outcomes in this population, accelerating disease progression and functional decline. This integrative review critically examines the clinical value of three widely used nutritional assessment tools-the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA), and the Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002)-in identifying malnutrition and guiding targeted interventions for older adults with COPD. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases for studies published between 2010 and 2025, using combinations of the keywords COPD, older adults, malnutrition, and nutritional assessment tools. Studies addressing both nutritional screening (risk detection) and nutritional assessment (comprehensive evaluation) were included to clarify their conceptual and practical distinctions. Findings indicate that while all three tools are useful for detecting nutritional risk, their sensitivity, specificity, and clinical applicability differ across settings. The MNA is most suitable for community and outpatient populations, the PG-SGA offers comprehensive evaluation for hospitalized or comorbid patients, and the NRS-2002 is effective for early inpatient screening and prognosis prediction. Integrating these tools into multidisciplinary COPD management enables early identification of malnutrition, sarcopenia, and immune dysfunction, supporting timely, personalized nutrition interventions. Future research should focus on standardizing tool selection, incorporating biomarkers and digital health technologies, and exploring AI-assisted assessments to enhance precision and applicability in diverse clinical contexts. This review underscores that routine nutritional assessment is not merely supportive care but an essential component of precision management for older adults with COPD.",Hao X; Bu T,Clinical interventions in aging,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41467232/,0,1,0,0,0,0

This analysis reviews the scientific literature on Industries 4.0 and 5.0 technologies, whether experimental or implemented, focused on producing large meals in food service. The review has been conducted through a systematic search, covering aspects from consumer ordering and the cooking process to distribution while considering management, quality control, and sustainability. A total of thirty-one articles, published between 2006 and 2025, were selected, with the majority focusing on Industry 5.0 (71%) and a significant proportion on testing phases (77.4%). In the context of Food Service Perspectives, the emphasis has been placed on customer service (32.3%), highlighting the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered robots for serving customers and AI for service personalization. Sustainability has also received attention (29%), focusing on AI and machine learning (ML) applications aimed at waste reduction. In management (22.6%), AI has been applied to optimize production schedules, enhance menu engineering, and improve overall management. Big Data (BD) and ML were utilized for sales analysis, while Blockchain technology was employed for traceability. Cooking innovations (9.7%) centered on automation, particularly the use of collaborative robots (cobots). For Quality Control (6.4%), AI, along with the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud Computing, has been used to monitor the physical aspects of food.

41464877,Integrating Cutting-Edge Technologies in Food Sensory and Consumer Science: Applications and Future Directions.,"With the introduction of emerging digital technologies, sensory and consumer science has evolved beyond traditional laboratory-based and self-response-centered sensory evaluations toward more objective assessments that reflect real-world consumption contexts. This review examines recent trends and potential applications in sensory evaluation research focusing on key enabling technologies-artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), extended reality (XR), biometrics, and digital sensors. Furthermore, it explores strategies for establishing personalized, multimodal, and intelligent-adaptive sensory evaluation systems through the integration of these technologies, as well as the applicability of sensory evaluation software. Recent studies report that AI/ML models used for sensory or preference prediction commonly achieve RMSE values of approximately 0.04-24.698, with prediction accuracy ranging from 79 to 100% (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.643-0.999). In XR environment, presence measured by the IPQ (7-point scale) is generally considered adequate when scores exceed 3. Finally, the review discusses ethical considerations arising throughout data collection, interpretation, and utilization processes and proposes future directions for the advancement of sensory and consumer science research. This systematic literature review aims to identify emerging technologies rather than provide a quantitative meta-analysis and therefore does not cover domain-specific analytical areas such as chemometrics beyond ML approaches or detailed flavor and aroma chemistry.",Lee D; Jeon H; Kim Y; Lee Y,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41464877/,1,0,0,0,0,0

41463367,Boron Bioavailability Revisited: From Plasma-Accessible Species to Microbiota-Accessible Complexes-Implications for Nutritional Essentiality.,"Boron (B) remains one of the least understood trace elements in human nutrition. Traditionally regarded as non-essential, its biological role has been reevaluated in light of emerging microbiome research. We provide a narrative synthesis of mechanistic, preclinical, and clinical studies to assess whether the colonic actions of B meet accepted criteria for nutritional essentiality. This review revisits B bioavailability through a dual-pathway framework distinguishing plasma-accessible boron (PAB)-small, fully absorbable species with transient systemic effects-from microbiota-accessible boron complexes (MABCs)-indigestible conjugates that reach the colon intact. Evidence indicates that PAB exerts short-term metabolic modulation, whereas MABCs act as prebiotic cofactors that stabilize microbial quorum sensing (autoinducer-2-borate; AI-2B), reinforce the colonic mucus barrier through borate-diol crosslinking, and support host-microbiota symbiosis. Deficiency or low intake of MABCs leads to dysbiosis, barrier fragility, and low-grade inflammation along gut-organ axes-effects reversible by MABC-rich diets. Analytical and clinical tools are proposed to discriminate between PAB and MABC pathways, including fecal B/speciation, AI-2B assays, and mucus-penetration markers. Recognizing B's essentiality as a microbiota-dependent nutrient reframes its nutritional assessment, guiding future dietary guidelines and prebiotic design toward the microbiome-mucus interface.",Biţă A; Scorei IR; Soriano-Ursúa MA; Pisoschi CG; Biţă CE; Dincă L; Ştefănescu S; Racu MV; Pinzaru I; Florescu C; Hădăreanu DR; Siloşi CA; Neamţu J; Gheonea DI; Mogoşanu GD; Zorilă MV,Biomolecules,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41463367/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41463285,HCC in the Era of Emerging MASH: The Role of Ultrasound in Surveillance and New Sonographic Features in Diagnosis.,"Conventional ultrasound (US) has long been central to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance in cirrhotic patients, due to its low cost, wide availability, non-invasiveness, and adequate sensitivity for detecting small nodules. However, its specificity in distinguishing HCC from other lesions is limited. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has significantly improved the characterization of nodules first identified on conventional US. Yet, when CEUS is performed using sulfur hexafluoride (SonoVue)-the only contrast agent available in Western countries-assessment remains restricted to a single nodule per examination, and enhanced CT or MRI is still required for full characterization and staging. In clinical settings, such as hepatology, internal medicine, infectious diseases, and surgery, CEUS offers the advantage of immediate availability, enabling rapid characterization of suspicious nodules in cirrhotic livers and facilitating timely therapeutic decisions. Although the introduction of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has substantially reduced HCV-related HCC, HCC incidence is increasingly driven by metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Evidence on surveillance strategies for MASH patients remains limited, and current EASL guidelines recommend monitoring only patients with >F2 fibrosis. Additionally, the effectiveness of US in obese or diabetic/obese populations is under ongoing investigation; abbreviated non-contrast MRI has been proposed as an alternative surveillance tool, but its adoption would entail significant economic implications for healthcare systems. HCC arising from MASH-sometimes even without cirrhosis-exhibits different sonographic and pathological features. Instead of small, hypoechoic nodules, typically seen in HCV-related cirrhosis, clinicians increasingly encounter larger or multiple lesions, often accompanied by macrovascular invasion, limiting access to curative treatments. Furthermore, typical CEUS LI-RADS patterns are less frequently observed. This review summarizes the evolving US findings in the era of MASH-related HCC and underscores the continued importance of US as the primary imaging tool in routine clinical practice.",Giorgio A; De Luca M; Lombardi A; Ciracì E; Rollo VC; Di Sarno A; Montesarchio L; Stella G; Giorgio V,Cancers,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41463285/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41454672,The role of gut microbiome in aging-associated diseases: where do we stand now and how technology will transform the future.,"The gut microbiome has emerged as a critical regulator of human aging and healthspan, with age-related dysbiosis increasingly implicated in a broad spectrum of aging-associated diseases. This review synthesizes evidence linking gut microbial alterations to infectious diseases, antimicrobial resistance, autoimmune, neurodegenerative, psychiatric, cancer, metabolic, kidney, cardiovascular, bone, and muscular diseases, highlighting shared mechanisms such as chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and metabolite imbalance. We further explore how enabling technologies, including functional multi-omics, synthetic biology, artificial intelligence-driven analytics, biobanking, and autologous fecal microbiota transplantation, are revolutionizing microbiome research and the design of interventions. Ethical considerations surrounding microbiome-based therapies are also addressed. To translate these scientific insights into clinical innovations, we formulate the PRIME framework: a five-phase roadmap encompassing <b>P</b>rofiling, <b>R</b>eviewing, <b>I</b>dentifying, <b>M</b>apping, and <b>E</b>valuating microbiome-based interventions.

41453658,Multimodal (Bio)Markers and Risk of Obesity - A Comprehensive Scoping Review.,"Obesity has been associated with several chronic diseases, especially noncommunicable ones and related comorbidities. Despite international efforts to decrease the prevalence of obesity, the number of persons struggling with this ailment is not decreasing. An important aspect is obesity prevention, including the early detection of the risk, i.e. whether an individual is likely to develop obesity, to allow for early risk stratification and countermeasure initiation. However, obesity is a complex and multifactorial complication, and many factors appear to play a role, including age, sex, diet, physical activity (PA), psychological and emotional status, genetic make-up, epigenetics, and gut microbiota. One isolated biomarker, therefore, could not enable optimal risk stratification and prognosis for the individual; rather, a combined set or multimodal approach to tackle risk prediction is demanded. Such a multimodal interpretation would integrate biomarkers from various domains, such as more classical markers (insulin, leptin), multiomics (e.g. genetics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics), behavioral attributes (dietary, PA, and sleep patterns, and smoking status), psychological traits (mental health status, depression, and eating disorders), and gut-microbiota (composition and diversity) into a combined interpretation, also employing more advanced interpretation tools, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. In this scoping review, we aimed to summarize the current state of the art in this area, highlighting the progress and novel approaches in combating obesity, and focusing on the feasibility and effectiveness of such biomarkers and their application within clinical trials.

41435869,"Modern Diets, Metabolic Inequity, and Race-Ethnic Disparities: Unraveling the Associations With MASLD and Cancer Risk.","Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is quickly emerging as a global public health concern, primarily fueled by the rising consumption of processed and ultraprocessed foods. This global health issue, showing a 50% increase in prevalence over two decades to 38% of the global population, is now the second most common cause of end-stage liver disease and liver transplants in Europe and the United States and an emerging driver of hepatocellular carcinoma, particularly in Hispanic and non-Hispanic White populations. Its prevalence, driven by increasing consumption of ultraprocessed foods, obesity, and sedentary lifestyles, disproportionately impacts racial and ethnic minorities, exacerbating health disparities. Genetic polymorphisms contribute to interindividual and interethnic variations in disease susceptibility. However, genetics alone cannot explain the disparities; social determinants, food insecurity, and limited access to healthcare also play pivotal roles. MASLD prevalence is rising fastest among older adults and Hispanic women, particularly in low-income and rural communities. Despite advances in pharmacologic therapies, access remains inequitable. Lifestyle interventions remain essential. Integrating genetic and epigenetic insights into risk stratification and treatment can support precision medicine approaches. A comprehensive MASLD management framework must include policy reforms to address food deserts, healthcare access, and socioeconomic inequities. Culturally tailored public health programs and personalized care models are crucial for enhancing outcomes in vulnerable populations. In this narrative review, we examine the multifaceted contributors to MASLD pathogenesis and disparities, with a focus on genetic risk, social determinants, dietary patterns, and cancer risk and policy-level interventions to inform more equitable liver health strategies.",Krishnan A; Kadakia KC; Rudnick SR; deLemos AS; Miller JD; Xiao T; Russo MW; Vrochides D; Schreiner A; Dharod A,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41435869/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41430014,Reflections on surgery for hiatal hernia.,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease and hiatal hernia are highly prevalent, chronic, and heterogeneous disfunctions with a profound impact on patient's quality of life. Impairment of the antireflux barrier -which includes the lower esophageal sphincter, the gastroesophageal flap valve, and the crural diaphragm- is the main pathophysiological factor responsible for symptoms and complications. Accurate diagnosis mandates a comprehensive multidisciplinary assessment including upper endoscopy, high-resolution manometry, barium esophagram, and ambulatory pH or pH-impedance monitoring to characterize anatomical defects, motility abnormalities, and reflux severity. Well selected individuals with refractory or complicated reflux disease, and those with large hiatal hernia and intrathoracic stomach, may benefit from laparoscopic surgical management including crural repair and fundoplication to restore the antireflux barrier. Nissen fundoplication is highly effective in controlling reflux but it may be associated with postoperative dysphagia and gas-bloat syndrome. Partial fundoplication can offer comparable reflux control with reduced adverse effects, especially in patients with impaired esophageal motility. Novel devices such as the LINX and the RefluxStop show promise in augmenting the lower esophageal sphincter with favorable safety profiles. The role of mesh reinforcement for hiatal repair remains contentious due to unpredictable outcomes and risk of complications. Robotic-assisted surgery offers enhanced technical precision but has yet to demonstrate significant clinical superiority and incurs greater costs compared to laparoscopy. Artificial intelligence applications are emerging as valuable adjuncts for preoperative planning, intraoperative guidance, and postoperative monitoring, potentially improving procedural standardization and surgical outcomes.",Aiolfi A; Bona D; Wang Q; Bonavina L,Updates in surgery,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41430014/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41429288,Challenges and Recommendations for Integrating Circadian Medicine in Critical Care: A Roadmap.,"Circadian rhythms are often severely disrupted in critically ill patients in the ICU. The ICU environment, characterized by irregular light-dark signals, continuous nutrition, and round-the-clock interventions, contributes to this disruption by providing weak and conflicting timing cues to the circadian system. Extensive scientific research has demonstrated that circadian rhythms play a vital role in regulating physiology and maintaining overall health. Therefore, integrating circadian principles into critical care may represent a promising strategy to improve patient outcomes in the ICU. What are the key challenges of integrating circadian medicine into critical care, what steps can address these challenges, and which recommendations can guide future study designs and clinical implementation? We convened a 5-day workshop in September 2024 that brought together 24 international experts with backgrounds in circadian biology, critical care, and implementation science. Each day was organized around a predefined theme, with morning presentations and plenary discussions, and afternoons dedicated to drafting a list of Propositions and Recommendations in breakout groups. Propositions and Recommendations were finalized via a post-workshop survey requiring ≥ 75% agreement. This roadmap summarizes the discussions and outcomes of the workshop, structured around a set of Propositions and Recommendations, and provides a framework for building a robust evidence base for integrating circadian principles into ICU practice. Key recommendations include the development of circadian outcome measures tailored for use in the ICU and using standardized frameworks for evaluating the effect of circadian interventions in clinical trials. Altogether, this roadmap provides an interdisciplinary framework resulting from a collaborative effort of ICU clinicians, circadian biologists, and implementation specialists, for building a robust evidence base for integrating circadian principles into ICU research and practice.",Hiemstra FW; González LB; Engelhardt LJ; Hancke L; Pilz LK; Adler AI; Dashti HS; Drouot X; Kitchen GB; Knauert MP; Kramer A; Lipton JO; Luetz A; Maas MB; Pajor NM; Parthasarathy S; Spies C; van Westerloo DJ; Felten M; Klerman EB; Ray DW; Ruben MD; Roenneberg T; Kervezee L,Chest,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41429288/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Manual blind insertion of nasojejunal feeding tubes is technically challenging, associated with a high failure rate, and prone to complications. The primary causes of suboptimal placement outcomes are the uncertainty and weak controllability of the interaction forces during the coordination between manual posterior advancement and the patient's physiological state. While current auxiliary techniques such as X-ray, ultrasound, and endoscopy can improve the success rate of nasojejunal tube placement and reduce complications to some extent, the accuracy and safety of placement remain constrained by challenges in controlling insertion forces and achieving precise positional localization. Robotic technology holds promise for addressing the uncertainties and controllability issues inherent in the placement process. By leveraging precise sensing, real-time navigation, and efficient control, robots can achieve intelligent positioning and precise control over the direction and location of the catheter tip during nasojejunal intubation. However, current research on robotic applications for nasojejunal feeding tube placement is still in an early stage, facing challenges such as high costs, operational complexity, and concerns over safety and reliability. Herein, we analyzed the limitations and causes of failure in existing placement methods and explored the application prospects of robotic technologies for precise control and intelligent positioning in nasojejunal feeding tube placement. The paper provides new insights for developing nursing techniques that enable safer and more effective, comfortable, and rapid intubation. Future efforts should focus on deepening the integration of artificial intelligence and robotics, optimizing drive technologies, and accelerating the translation of these technologies from the laboratory to clinical practice. This will drive the advancement of nasojejunal feeding tube placement techniques towards intelligent, precise, and accessible solutions.",Qiu Y; Hong R; Xiang G; Hong D; Zhang Y; Li K; Qian H; Dian S; Li K; Pu W,Sichuan da xue xue bao.

41413746,Large language models in obesity: a systematic review.,"Generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), is rapidly evolving and holds significant potential for addressing the multifaceted challenges of obesity management. This systematic review synthesizes current research on LLM applications within the obesity field, critically evaluating their performance, limitations, and key future research directions. Electronic databases, including MEDLINE, OVID, and SCOPUS, were systematically searched from inception to August 2025 to identify eligible studies. Eligible studies investigated the potential role of LLMs in obesity medical and surgical care. Key findings were extracted and synthesized narratively. The ROBINS-I tool was used to assess the risk of bias across each study. Thirty-three studies met the inclusion criteria. The analysis reveals that LLMs are being applied across a diverse range of obesity-related topics, including personalized nutrition, educational interventions, guideline-directed medical therapy, weight loss strategies, anti-obesity medication information, and motivational interviewing. While some LLMs demonstrated promising accuracy and utility, substantial variability was observed. Numerous studies highlighted limitations, including inconsistent recommendations, inaccuracies, difficulties in handling complex scenarios, and a potential for biased outputs. Generative AI and LLMs show considerable promise for enhancing various aspects of obesity management, from personalized interventions to clinical decision support. However, the current state of the technology exhibits crucial limitations regarding accuracy, consistency, and the ability to handle nuanced clinical situations, mandating a continued critical role for clinician oversight and validation. Further research is imperative to address these shortcomings, focusing on improving model training, validating performance in real-world settings, and addressing ethical considerations before widespread clinical implementation.",Suenghataiphorn T; Tribuddharat N; Danpanichkul P; Kulthamrongsri N,International journal of obesity (2005),2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41413746/,0,1,0,0,0,0

41406471,Effectiveness of mHealth Interventions to Improve Follow-Up and Management Among Solid Organ Transplant Recipients: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Effective follow-up and management after organ transplantation are crucial for transplant recipients. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have emerged as a significant approach for facilitating follow-up and management. However, there is a lack of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of their effectiveness. This study aimed to systematically review and synthesize evidence regarding the effectiveness of mHealth interventions in enhancing follow-up and management for transplant recipients. This study included both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized studies of interventions (NRSIs) that compared the effects of mHealth interventions with usual care in transplant recipients by searching PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL, and CENTRAL from database inception to June 2025. The primary outcomes included self-care ability, medical regimen adherence, self-monitoring, communication and counseling, medication adherence, physical activity, nutrition, all-cause mortality, complications, rehospitalization, and emergency and outpatient department visits. The risk of bias for each study was assessed using version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for RCTs and the Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions tool for NRSIs. Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted by 2 reviewers independently. Data synthesis was conducted using Review Manager. Both a meta-analysis and a narrative synthesis were carried out. A total of 23 studies (n=15, 65% RCTs and n=8, 35% NRSIs) with 2022 transplant recipients were included. Compared to the control group, mHealth interventions significantly improved self-care ability (mean difference 14.49, 95% CI 9.61-19.36; P<.001) and reduced rehospitalization (odds ratio [OR] 0.49, 95% CI 0.34-0.71; P<.001). The meta-analysis demonstrated no statistically significant difference in mortality rates (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.39-1.35; P=.31), rejection (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.25-1.19; P=.13), or infection (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.06-1.82; P=.20) between the mHealth intervention and control groups. The narrative synthesis indicated that mHealth interventions could effectively promote adherence to medical regimens and medications, facilitate self-monitoring, and improve communication and consultation. mHealth interventions significantly improved self-care ability and reduced rehospitalization rates among organ transplant recipients. However, these interventions did not demonstrate a significant effect on all-cause mortality or complications. mHealth interventions showed potential benefits for various self-management behaviors in organ transplant recipients, but these findings need to be further verified. Future research should prioritize high-quality studies that investigate the impact of mHealth on physical activity, nutrition, and other patient-centered outcomes.

41404228,The Role of Artificial Intelligence in General Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Machine Learning Applications in Colorectal Cancer Treatment Outcomes.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of global cancer morbidity and mortality, with surgical resection as the primary curative treatment. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML), into CRC surgery presents a promising avenue for improving patient care through enhanced prediction and precision. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesize evidence on the impact of ML on CRC surgical outcomes. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science was conducted on September 1, 2025, following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Ultimately, 10 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis, with a subset used in the meta-analysis. The results indicated that ML-assisted or robotic surgeries were associated with a nonsignificant reduction in postoperative complications (risk ratio (RR) 0.85, 95% CI 0.70-1.03) compared to conventional methods. However, robotic procedures were significantly linked to longer operative times (mean difference (MD) +45.2 min, 95% CI 28.5-61.9). The meta-analysis of predictive model performance yielded a pooled area under the curve (AUC) of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.80-0.88), suggesting good overall discriminatory ability, though this finding is tempered by substantial heterogeneity (I²=68%) and a high risk of bias across all included studies. In conclusion, while ML applications in CRC surgery show potential, current evidence does not confirm significant superiority in reducing complications. The increased operative time and methodological limitations of existing research highlight the need for more rigorous, high-quality trials to fully ascertain the clinical value of these technologies.",Alshammari A; Boabbas A; Nassar B; Shaikhah A,Cureus,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41404228/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41392710,Transforming atrial fibrillation management by targeting comorbidities and reducing atrial fibrillation burden: the 10th AFNET/EHRA consensus conference.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a growing unmet medical need. To reduce its impact on patients' lives, improvements in stroke prevention therapy, treatment of concomitant conditions, and rhythm control therapy are actively developed: Innovations in anti-thrombotic agents, new anti-arrhythmic drugs (AADs), and novel interventional rhythm control therapies emerge alongside AF-reducing effects of general cardiometabolic therapies. Simple risk scores are slowly replaced by personalized AF risk estimation using quantifiable features. These developments were discussed by over 80 experts from academia and industry during the 10th Atrial Fibrillation NETwork /European Heart Rhythm Association consensus conference from 5 to 7 May 2025. The emerging consensus, described here, is multi-domain therapy combining stroke prevention, rhythm control, and therapy of concomitant cardiovascular conditions. This combines anti-coagulants, AADs, and AF ablation with old and new cardiometabolic drugs that can reduce AF risk, AF burden, and AF-related complications at scale. The paper furthermore describes quantitative traits that may enable a shift towards risk-driven therapy based on AF phenotypes. These can enable adjusted therapy strategies that are safe, accessible, and patient-centred. Applying modern data science and artificial intelligence methods to quantitative phenotypic and genetic features can further improve risk estimation and personalized therapy selection. At the same time, translational and clinical research into reversing the drivers of AF and into improved stroke prevention through new drugs and through combination therapies is needed. Together, these efforts offer pathways towards personalized, patient-centred, multi-modal, and accessible AF management that integrates rhythm control, stroke prevention, and therapy of concomitant conditions to bridge today's practical needs with tomorrow's therapeutic innovation.",Svennberg E; Merino JL; Andrade J; Anselmino M; Arbelo E; Boersma E; Boriani G; Breithardt G; Chung M; Chyou J; Cohen A; Nielsen JC; Dichtl W; Diederichsen SZ; Dobrev D; Doehner W; Dworatzek E; Fabritz L; Filgueiras-Rama D; Gimpelewicz C; Hack G; Hatem S; Healey J; Heidbuchel H; Hijazi Z; Holst AG; Hove-Madsen L; Jalife J; van Leerdam R; Linz D; Lip GYH; Lubitz S; de Melis M; Meyer R; Orczykowski M; Parwani AS; Porta-Sanchez A; de Potter T; Ravens U; Rienstra M; Rillig A; Rivard L; Scherr D; Schnabel RB; Schotten U; Simovic S; Sinner M; Sohns C; Sommer P; Steinbeck G; Steven D; Sultan A; Thomalla G; Toennis T; Tzeis S; Voigt N; Wadhwa M; Wakili R; Witt H; Goette A; Kirchhof P,"Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41392710/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41391820,Emerging nanoparticle-based therapies for pancreatic cancer: Current clinical landscape.,"Pancreatic cancer, particularly ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive and lethal subtypes due to late diagnosis, the absence of early biomarkers, and the presence of a complex tumor microenvironment (TME). This TME is characterized by a dense desmoplastic stroma, hypovascularization, immunosuppression, and an acidic extracellular pH. All of these factors hinder the delivery and efficacy of conventional therapies, especially in advanced stages. Nanoparticles (NPs), including liposomes, polymeric micelles, albumin-bound particles and lipid nanoparticles, have emerged as a promising tool for overcoming TME barriers, and enhance drug delivery in tumor while minimizing systemic toxicity. NPs can exploit mechanisms such as the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect and active targeting. Clinically approved NPs such as Nab-Paclitaxel and liposomal Irinotecan have demonstrated improved pharmacokinetics and therapeutic benefits in PDAC. Furthermore, ongoing clinical trials are exploring novel NP-based strategies such as gene delivery, radiosensitization, immunomodulation and ferroptosis induction. Despite these promising advances, significant challenges remain, including poor tumor penetration, heterogeneity in EPR, and immune recognition of NPs leading to their clearance from bloodstream before reaching the tumor. Innovative solutions such as biomimetic coatings, stimuli-responsive systems and personalized formulations, are being evaluated to enhance NP performance. Standardization of NP characterization and data reporting are essential to accelerating clinical translation. The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning could further optimize NP design and patient stratification. Overall, nanotechnology represents a crucial frontier of research for developing more effective and personalized pancreatic cancer treatments.",Salgado-Pascual A; Zalba S; Lasarte JJ; Garrido MJ,Advanced drug delivery reviews,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41391820/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41391515,Genetic and epigenetic determinants of injury risk and recovery in elite athletes: toward precision sports medicine.,"Musculoskeletal injuries and interindividual variability in recovery remain critical challenges for sustaining elite athletic performance. Despite advances in diagnostics, training, and rehabilitation, unexplained differences in injury risk and recovery efficiency persist. Growing evidence implicates genetic and epigenetic mechanisms in these disparities, influencing collagen integrity, inflammatory regulation, oxidative stress, and muscle regeneration. Key contributors include single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in COL1A1, COL5A1, ACTN3, and IL6, as well as novel loci identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Polygenic risk scores (PRS), which integrate the effects of multiple low-impact variants, enhance prediction compared to single-gene markers. Epigenetic regulators, including DNA methylation and exercise-responsive microRNAs (e.g., miR-206, miR-133a, miR-486), provide a dynamic interface linking genetic predisposition with environmental factors such as training load and nutrition. Integration of genomic data with wearable technologies and artificial intelligence enables real-time monitoring, adaptive recovery, and precision load management. Yet, clinical translation faces challenges including limited population diversity, interpretative complexity, and ethical concerns over data privacy and potential misuse. Advancing precision sports medicine will require multidisciplinary, systems-level strategies that unite molecular insights with practical implementation, ultimately enabling individualized injury prevention, optimized rehabilitation, and the preservation of long-term athlete health and performance.",Ding H; Deng Q; Guo Z,Gene,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41391515/,1,0,0,0,0,0

41388628,Bioactive peptides from milk proteins: current insights into novel preparation strategies and application prospects.,"The rising global burden of chronic diseases necessitates safer and more sustainable alternatives to conventional pharmaceuticals, which are often associated with adverse effects and high costs. Bioactive peptides (BPs) derived from milk proteins have emerged as promising candidates, offering a multifaceted approach to health promotion and disease prevention. However, BPs exhibit inherent limitations, such as poor palatability and low bioavailability. Additionally, conventional screening methods for BPs suffer from low efficiency. This review critically analyzes traditional and novel strategies for liberating BPs from milk proteins, including enzymatic hydrolysis, microbial fermentation, and their synergistic combination. Crucially, it extends beyond production to explore cutting-edge solutions to longstanding challenges in BPs development, such as peptide self-assembly and advanced delivery systems. Furthermore, it highlights the transformative role of artificial intelligence (AI) in bridging peptide sequences with their biofunctions and optimizing production parameters. Notably, the integration of AI has revolutionized the field by enabling the prediction of structure-function relationships between peptide sequences and bioactivities. AI further facilitates the optimization of production parameters, overcoming inefficiencies and limitations of conventional screening methods. Collectively, these technological advancements provide a strong foundation for developing high-value peptide-based nutraceuticals and functional foods, promoting applications in precise nutrition and targeted disease intervention.",Li H; Gong H; Wang J; Mao X,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41388628/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41388280,"Highly pathogenic avian influenza: a One Health perspective on risks, surveillance, and resilience.","Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) poses an expanding global threat with direct relevance to immunologists studying host-pathogen dynamics, cross-species transmission, and immune responses to emerging viruses. Driven primarily by evolving H5 and H7 influenza A subtypes, HPAI now affects a broadening host range, including spillovers into mammals such as seals, cattle, and humans, raising concern for pandemic potential. Applying a One Health perspective, this review emphasizes the immunological and ecological factors that underlie HPAI emergence and spread. Migratory bird flyways, shared aquatic habitats, and intensive poultry systems create viral mixing zones that promote antigenic diversification and interspecies transmission. Climate change and land-use transformation exacerbate these risks by altering host distributions and increasing interfaces between wildlife, livestock, and people. While poultry vaccines are widely used, human vaccine development faces challenges from antigenic drift, clade variation, and limited cross-protective immunity. Immunologists play a critical role in understanding these dynamics, particularly regarding host immune barriers, viral adaptation, and the development of broad-spectrum or next-generation vaccines. Technological advances in pathogen surveillance, such as AI-driven forecasting, genomic sequencing, and real-time risk mapping, are promising early-warning tools, but require stronger integration across human, animal, and environmental health sectors. Addressing HPAI's complex immunoecological dynamics demands a One Health approach: cross-sectoral data sharing, coordinated response strategies, and investment in resilient health systems. As HPAI continues to evolve and expand its host range, sustained global investment in One Health governance, research, and infrastructure will be vital to prevent future pandemics and safeguard health across species.",Chou TN; Naumova EN; Gass JD,ImmunoHorizons,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41388280/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41386261,"Disease burden attributable to intimate partner violence against females and sexual violence against children in 204 countries and territories, 1990-2023: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023.","Violence against women and against children are human rights violations with lasting harms to survivors and societies at large. Intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual violence against children (SVAC) are two major forms of such abuse. Despite their wide-reaching effects on individual and community health, these risk factors have not been adequately prioritised as key drivers of global health burden. Comprehensive x§and reliable estimates of the comparative health burden of IPV and SVAC are urgently needed to inform investments in prevention and support for survivors at both national and global levels. We estimated the prevalence and attributable burden of IPV among females and SVAC among males and females for 204 countries and territories, by age and sex, from 1990 to 2023, as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2023. We searched several global databases for data on self-reported exposure to IPV and SVAC and undertook a systematic review to identify the health outcomes associated with each of these risk factors. We modelled IPV and SVAC prevalence using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, applying data adjustments to account for measurement heterogeneity. We employed burden-of-proof methodology to estimate relative risks for outcomes associated with IPV and SVAC. These estimates informed the calculation of population attributable fractions, which were then used to quantify disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to each risk factor. Globally, in 2023, we estimated that 608 million (95% uncertainty interval 518-724) females aged 15 years and older had ever been exposed to IPV, and 1·01 billion (0·764-1·48) individuals aged 15 years and older had experienced sexual violence during childhood. 18·5 million (8·74-30·0) DALYs were attributed to IPV among females and 32·2 million (16·4-52·5) DALYs were attributed to SVAC among males and females in 2023. IPV and SVAC were among the top contributors to the global disease burden in 2023, particularly among females aged 15-49 years, ranking as the fourth and fifth leading risk factors, respectively, for DALYs in this group. Among the eight health outcomes found to be associated with IPV, anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder were the leading causes of IPV-attributed DALYs, accounting for 5·43 million (-1·25 to 14·6) and 3·96 million (1·71 to 6·92) DALYs in 2023, respectively. SVAC was associated with 14 health outcomes, including mental health disorder, substance use disorder, and chronic and infectious disease outcomes. Self-harm and schizophrenia were the leading causes of SVAC-attributed burden, with SVAC accounting for 6·71 million (2·00 to 12·7) DALYs due to self-harm and 4·15 million (-1·92 to 13·1) DALYs due to schizophrenia in 2023. IPV and SVAC are substantial contributors to global health burden, and their health consequences span a variety of individual health outcomes. Importantly, mental health disorders account for the greatest share of disease burden among survivors. Investing in prevention of these avoidable risk factors has the potential to avert millions of DALYs and considerable premature mortality each year. Our findings represent strong evidence for global and national leaders to elevate IPV and SVAC among public health priorities. Sustained investments are needed to prevent IPV and SVAC and to implement interventions focused on supporting the complex social and health needs of survivors.

41371352,Measuring biological age: Insights from omics studies.,"Biological ageing is a systemic, multifactorial process driven by progressive molecular and cellular alterations whose complexity necessitates systems-level approaches. Advances in high-throughput omics technologies now allow simultaneous quantification of millions of biomolecules from a single specimen, enabling longitudinal, integrative profiling across multiple molecular layers. This review synthesizes recent progress in applying genomics, epigenomics, metabolomics and microbiomics to ageing research, highlighting their contributions to biomarker discovery, mechanistic insight, and translational opportunities. Genomic studies reveal genetic variants that promote extreme longevity, while epigenetic clocks provide robust predictors of biological age. The blood proteome can be used to calculate proteome-based scores and evaluate temporal changes in ageing trajectories in an organ- and sex-specific manner. Metabolomic signatures identify key metabolites reflecting ageing trajectories, and microbiome research demonstrates that gut microbial composition mirrors and modulates biological ageing, with microbiome clocks emerging. The omics approaches have further elucidated the impact of exercise and diet providing evidence that interventions can reduce biological age. The integration of multi-omics with clinical and lifestyle data, powered by machine learning and artificial intelligence, is paving the way for a holistic definition of biological age and the development of personalized healthy ageing strategies.

41351755,"Toward a record-eligible sub-2-hour marathon: an updated integrative framework of Physiological, technological, and cognitive determinants.","Breaking the sub-2-hour marathon barrier under record-eligible conditions requires the coordinated contribution of physiological, biomechanical, psychological, environmental, nutritional, and technological factors. Achieving such a feat demands aerobic power (VO₂<sub>max</sub> ≈ 75-85 mL·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹), running economy (≤ 190 mL·kg⁻¹·km⁻¹ at 21 km·h⁻¹), fractional utilization (90-94% VO₂<sub>max</sub>, near the maximum metabolic steady state), favourable anthropometry (e.g., low body mass), efficient neuromuscular coordination, and cognitive endurance to sustain near-threshold effort for ~ 2 h. Technological innovations, particularly carbon-fiber-plated footwear (""supershoes"") together with refined pacing strategies, optimized nutrition (carbohydrate intake ~ 60-100 g·h⁻¹; caffeine 3-6 mg·kg⁻¹), and advantageous environmental conditions (~ 10 °C, < 60% RH, low wind) have further narrowed the remaining gap. This narrative review extends previous integrative perspectives by incorporating recent advances in thermoregulation, emerging AI-assisted training applications, and cognitive performance into a conceptual systems-oriented perspective on the determinants of record-eligible sub-2-hour marathon performance. It synthesizes multidisciplinary evidence to propose a conceptual model illustrating how physiological, mechanical, cognitive, and technological domains interact to constrain or enhance endurance capacity. The INEOS 1:59 Challenge (1:59:40) and Kelvin Kiptum's world record (2:00:35) exemplify the proximity of this frontier, while ongoing innovations in real-time monitoring and predictive analytics are expected to refine performance optimization further.

41328816,Interactive Conversational Agents to Improve Dietary Behaviors for Health Promotion: Mixed Systematic Review.,"Chronic diseases are the leading global cause of death, largely driven by Western lifestyles characterized by poor diets and physical inactivity. Digital interventions offer promising tools to support health behavior change. Interactive conversational agents (CAs) provide real-time, personalized meal planning and dietary advice. Their interactive nature and adaptability make them valuable for promoting healthy dietary behaviors in the context of diet-related chronic diseases. However, evidence of their effectiveness remains limited. Systematic evaluations of their impact, features, and user acceptability are needed to clarify their role in public health strategies for improving dietary behaviors and preventing chronic diseases. This review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of CAs in improving dietary behaviors, to describe their features, functions, conversational capabilities, and impact on nutritional knowledge, usability, acceptability, user experience, and engagement. Five electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, and PsycINFO. We only included sources that focused on the use of CAs to change dietary behavior. Eligible studies were published since 2013 in English, French, or Spanish. Two independent reviewers screened studies, with a third resolving disagreements. The quality of studies was appraised using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (McGill University). Quantitative and qualitative findings were synthesized narratively. In total, 2200 references were identified, and after screening and eligibility assessment, 11 references (10 studies with approximately 20-480 participants) were included. Among the included studies, improvements in fruit and vegetable intake were reported in 2 studies (P=.04 and P=.005). One study found significant increases in adherence to the Mediterranean diet at 6 weeks with gains maintained at 12 weeks. Two additional studies reported enhanced nutritional knowledge (eg, nutrition label use). Effects on protein, whole grains, sugar, sodium, and caffeine intake were mixed or nonsignificant. Some studies reported increased physical activity (+109.8 min/wk) and reduced alcohol use for stress management. One randomized controlled trial showed modest but significant weight loss and decrease in waist circumference (-2.1 cm, 95% CI -3.5 to 0.7; P=.003). Engagement varied between studies. Usability and user experience were generally positive; goal setting, feedback, and tailored recommendations were linked to higher satisfaction. Reported challenges included unnatural conversation style, simplistic content, and limited perceived usefulness. CAs show promising potential to improve dietary behaviors, with evidence of gains in fruit and vegetable intake, Mediterranean diet adherence, nutritional knowledge, physical activity, and modest weight loss. Overall usability was favorable, but variability in outcomes, high attrition, and limited impact on social support highlight areas for refinement. Future research should use larger samples, longer follow-up, standardized outcomes, and strategies to enhance sustained engagement and inclusivity. Systematic evaluations and refined designs are essential to establish the role of CAs as scalable, evidence-based tools in chronic disease prevention.",Amil S; Gagnon MP; Bédard A; Da SMAR; Zavala Mora D; Drapeau V; Desroches S,Journal of medical Internet research,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41328816/,0,1,0,0,0,1

Accurate assessment of muscle mass is essential for its diagnosis. Currently the agreement on how to use imaging for sarcopenia detection is still debated and how well the muscle imaging assessments correlate with muscle function needs further agreement. Recognizing the critical role of imaging in this process, the China National Center for Orthopedics (NCO) and the East Meets West Action Group of European Calcified Tissue Society (ECTS) convened a working group endorsed by the Board of the ECTS. This paper aims to evaluate the utility of various imaging techniques for diagnosing sarcopenia and understanding its functional consequences. We synthesize evidence on DXA, BIA, CT, MRI and ultrasound, and provide specific related recommendations. Imaging cannot replace functional assessments, but may enhance them by revealing subclinical disease, clarifying pathophysiology, and enabling individualized care.

41320420,Manipulating starch crystalline structure for controlled digestibility and glycemic response.,"Postprandial hyperglycemia is a key driver in the development of type 2 diabetes, and dietary starch is a major modulator of glycemic response. The crystalline structure of starch is a principal determinant of its digestibility and postprandial glycemic response. This review synthesizes evidence establishing that the molecular packing density and stability of A-, B-, and V-type crystals often outweigh the influence of crystallinity or crystalline type alone in governing digestion resistance. We demonstrate how advanced processing techniques can precisely engineer these structural features to reduce starch digestibility. While in vitro models provide valuable mechanistic insights and animal studies elucidate underlying metabolic pathways, human trials consistently show significant individual variability in glycemic responses to crystalline transformations. This discrepancy underscores the limitation of a one-size-fits-all approach and highlights the necessity of integrating human data for meaningful predictions. Finally, we discuss the promising convergence of artificial intelligence and food structure engineering, such as 3D printing, as a transformative strategy for designing personalized low-glycemic-index foods based on tailored starch crystalline architectures. This work provides a timely synthesis to guide future research and practical applications in functional foods and diabetes management.",Zhu R; Li X; Ren J; Wang P; Wang R; Guo J; He J; Guo J; Liu S; Ren F; Xu H; Hu Y,Carbohydrate polymers,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41320420/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41319613,Use of hyperspectral imaging for the early detection of foodborne pathogens.,"Pathogenic food microbes pose a serious threat to global health, leading to widespread disease outbreaks, economic losses, and disruptions in the food processing and distribution chain. Current detection methods for infectious agents, including conventional culturing and genotypic techniques, are accurate but often face limitations such as costly equipment, the need for specialized personnel, and lengthy analysis times. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has emerged as a promising alternative that provides a fast, non-invasive, and high-throughput approach for early identification of pathogenic food microbes. HSI combines spatial and spectral characterization to deliver information across a broad wavelength range. This technology enables the recognition and identification of microbial agents by analyzing their unique spectral fingerprints, which reflect the biochemical and physical properties of bacteria, fungi, and viruses in various food matrices, including raw produce, animal protein, and milk-based foods. A typical HSI system can acquire a complete spectral cube in less than a minute per sample, capturing 100-300 contiguous spectral bands across the visible to near-infrared range, thus enabling rapid and comprehensive microbial screening. This review highlights several foodborne pathogens and the strong applicability of HSI for their identification. Additionally, it discusses recent trends, suggests future directions, and emphasizes AI adoption along with the development of portable HSI devices for on-site food safety assessment.",Alaguthevar R; Duraisamy A; Murugesan B; Muniraj I; Khan A; Rhim JW,"Colloids and surfaces.

41305556,The Role of Diet in Women of Childbearing Age: Current Evidence Supporting Nutritional Recommendations.,"Nutrition during the reproductive years shapes women's immediate health, fertility, pregnancy outcomes, and long-term offspring well-being. This position paper narratively synthesizes and critically appraises evidence on how dietary patterns, macro-/micronutrients, and supplementation influence women's health, female fertility, and reproductive outcomes, to inform practical recommendations. We narratively reviewed recent reviews, cohort studies, clinical trials, and public-health guidance on macronutrients, key micronutrients, dietary patterns (with emphasis on the Mediterranean diet), ultra-processed food (UPF) intake, and targeted supplementation relevant to menstrual, metabolic, cardiovascular, skeletal, and reproductive outcomes. Balanced, diverse diets rich in whole and minimally processed foods support hormonal regulation, ovulatory function, healthy gestation, and chronic-disease risk reduction. Priority nutrients include iron, folate, calcium, vitamin D, zinc, vitamin B12, and long-chain omega-3s (DHA), with supplementation considered when dietary intake or bioavailability is inadequate. Evidence consistently links Mediterranean-style eating to improved metabolic health, insulin sensitivity, IVF success, lower gestational diabetes risk, and favorable neonatal outcomes. High UPF consumption is associated with poorer diet quality, inflammation, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and potential reproductive impairment, warranting a reduction in favor of nutrient-dense foods. Diet also influences cardiovascular and bone health through effects on lipids, glycemia, blood pressure, and mineral/vitamin status, with fiber-rich carbohydrates, unsaturated fats (notably olive oil), and adequate calcium-vitamin D emerging as central levers. For women of childbearing age, a Mediterranean-aligned, minimally processed dietary pattern-tailored to individual needs and complemented by prudent use of folate, iron, vitamin D, calcium, B12, and DHA when indicated-offers robust benefits across reproductive, metabolic, cardiovascular, and skeletal domains. Public-health actions should improve access to healthy foods, curb UPF marketing, and embed personalized nutrition counseling in routine care; further longitudinal research from preconception through postpartum is needed.",Maugeri A; Barchitta M; Favara G; Magnano San Lio R; Ojeda-Granados C; Alonzo E; Bellavia D; Bonaccio M; Di Nucci A; Donfrancesco C; Esposito S; Gandullia P; Giavaresi G; Giroli M; Grigolo B; Grassi F; Leonardi F; Proietti E; Sciacca L; Iacoviello L; Agodi A,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41305556/,1,0,0,0,0,1
41302083,"Nutrigenomics of Obesity: Integrating Genomics, Epigenetics, and Diet-Microbiome Interactions for Precision Nutrition.","Obesity is a highly complex, multifactorial disease influenced by dynamic interactions among genetic, epigenetic, environmental, and behavioral determinants that explicitly position genetics as the core. While advances in multi-omic integration have revolutionized our understanding of adiposity pathways, translation into personalized clinical nutrition remains a critical challenge. This review systematically consolidates emerging insights into the molecular and nutrigenomic architecture of obesity by integrating data from large-scale GWAS, functional epigenomics, nutrigenetic interactions, and microbiome-mediated metabolic programming. The primary aim is to systematically organize and synthesize recent genetic and genomic findings in obesity, while also highlighting how these discoveries can be contextualized within precision nutrition frameworks. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science up to July 2024 using MeSH terms, nutrigenomic-specific queries, and multi-omics filters. Eligible studies were classified into five domains: monogenic obesity, polygenic GWAS findings, epigenomic regulation, nutrigenomic signatures, and gut microbiome contributions. Over 127 candidate genes and 253 QTLs have been implicated in obesity susceptibility. Monogenic variants (e.g., <i>LEP</i>, <i>LEPR</i>, <i>MC4R</i>, <i>POMC</i>, <i>PCSK1</i>) explain rare, early-onset phenotypes, while <i>FTO</i> (polygenic) and <i>MC4R</i> (monogenic mutations as well as common polygenic variants) represent major loci across populations. Epigenetic mechanisms, dietary composition, physical activity, and microbial diversity significantly recalibrate obesity trajectories. Integration of genomics, functional epigenomics, precision nutrigenomics, and microbiome science presents transformative opportunities for personalized obesity interventions. However, translation into evidence-based clinical nutrition remains limited, emphasizing the need for functional validation, cross-ancestry mapping, and AI-driven precision frameworks. Specifically, this review systematically identifies and integrates evidence from genomics, epigenomics, nutrigenomics, and microbiome studies published between 2000 and 2024, applying structured inclusion/exclusion criteria and narrative synthesis to highlight translational pathways for precision nutrition.",Farzand A; Rohin MAK; Awan SJ; Ahmad AMR; Akram H; Saleem T; Imran MM,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41302083/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41295839,AI and Biotechnology to Combat Aflatoxins: Future Directions for Modern Technologies in Reducing Aflatoxin Risk.,"Although a decades-old problem in food safety, aflatoxin has largely resisted human control methods. This situation could be mitigated using new technologies that could provide better control all along the food supply chain, for crops frequently infected with the causative fungi <i>Aspergillus flavus</i> and <i>A. parasiticus</i>, which produce aflatoxin. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) and modern biotechnology could offer, and have offered, a suite of potential solutions to reducing both fungal infection and aflatoxin contamination of foods. In this paper, we describe these technologies, as well as means by which they may be utilized to reduce aflatoxin risk along the food supply chain. We discuss how regulatory frameworks worldwide may be restrictive for biotechnologies in certain parts of the world, but are relatively less stringent for AI at present. To the extent that these technologies can be harnessed and deployed safely to combat the problem of aflatoxins, we encourage research and development in these areas to improve the precision, accuracy, and speed by which to deal with this food safety risk.",Gamlath CJ; Wu F,Toxins,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41295839/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41295247,Personalized Parenteral Nutrition in Critically Ill Patients Undergoing Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy: A Comprehensive Framework for Clinical Practice.,"Critically ill patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) face distinct nutritional challenges requiring specialized parenteral nutrition (PN) strategies. This review synthesizes current evidence with clinical expertise to provide a comprehensive nutritional framework for this population. Key findings reveal that CRRT significantly impacts nutrient homeostasis through daily losses of amino acids (14-22 g), water-soluble vitamins, and trace elements via the extracorporeal circuit. Results from observational studies demonstrate that higher protein targets (1.8-2.5 g/kg/day) are necessary to achieve positive nitrogen balance, while energy prescriptions must subtract ""hidden"" calories from citrate anticoagulation (3-4 kcal/mmol) and propofol (1.1 kcal/mL). Clinical outcome data, though primarily observational, indicate that achieving nutritional adequacy correlates with reduced ICU stays (average reduction 2.1-3.4 days), shorter mechanical ventilation duration, and improved functional recovery. Evidence supports that early PN prescription when indicated, coupled with systematic consideration of therapy modality, extracorporeal losses, oral intake capacity, and mobilization status, optimizes nutritional support. We conclude that successful implementation requires: (1) dynamic adjustment based on CRRT parameters, (2) integration with enteral nutrition when feasible, (3) regular metabolic monitoring, (4) multidisciplinary collaboration, and (5) structured protocols. Future research using point-of-care analysis and AI-driven support systems is needed to establish evidence-based guidelines in this specialized population.",Sinatra N; Maniaci A; Cuttone G; Senussi Testa T; Tutino S; Paternò DS; Girombelli A; Ippati G; Caputo G; Sorbello M; La Via L,Journal of personalized medicine,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41295247/,1,0,0,0,0,0

This review focuses on eosinophil contributions to cell-mediated adaptive immunity by exploring the multifaceted interactions between eosinophils and T cells that underlie their unique contributions to immune modulation in allergic diseases. We begin by reviewing key features of eosinophil immunobiology within the context of their relevance to the development, differentiation, and function of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in homeostasis and immunity. Building on this framework, we review recent literature revealing new roles for eosinophils in homeostatic immunosuppression, adaptive immune initiation, and immunomodulation within the context of an active immune response. We further explore the significance of eosinophil functionality impacting the structure and function of primary and secondary lymphoid organs, including thymic involution and regeneration, on cell-mediated immunity.

This review explores recent progress in integrating artificial intelligence with nutritional therapy in ICUs, highlighting its evolution and potential benefits in precision-guided support, along with current implementation challenges. Widely used in adult and neonatal ICUs, parenteral nutrition faces persistent challenges including ordering errors, practice variability, and insufficient robust long-term outcome evidence. Recent advances in machine learning have demonstrated considerable potential in predicting nutrition-related complications (e.g. neonatal morbidities, cholestasis, feeding intolerances, and malnutrition), optimizing nutrient delivery through dynamic, real-time recommendations, and enhancing clinical decision-making with large language models (LLMs) that synthesize clinical guidelines and patient data into actionable insights. However, future studies must establish causal relationships between optimal parenteral nutrition and long-term outcomes while addressing confounding factors and ingredient heterogeneity.

However, striking variations in the immunogenicity and efficacy of some vaccines persist across populations. Notably, suboptimal responses to some vaccines, also known as vaccine hyporesponsiveness, have been observed in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) compared with high-income countries or in rural areas within LMICs compared with urban areas within LMICs. Environmental factors, host genetics, lifestyle, and nutrition contribute to immunological variations influencing vaccine responses, highlighting the need to identify key immune signatures that can be manipulated to overcome vaccine hyporesponsiveness. The integration of diverse datasets, accelerated by artificial intelligence, is essential to achieve this goal, which is currently hampered by the under-representation of data from LMICs. The HypoVax Global knowledge hub aims to address this gap by fostering international collaboration and compiling globally representative immunological data from population studies and vaccine trials.

While the individual contributions of neuroinflammation, brain insulin resistance, and micronutrient deficiencies to AD pathology are well-established, a significant knowledge gap exists in understanding their intricate, synergistic interactions. This review proposes a novel integrated framework of bidirectional crosstalk where these three factors create a self-perpetuating cycle of neurodegeneration. A comprehensive literature review was conducted, including all aspects of epidemiological and biological context associated with vitamins, micronutrients, and dietary patterns; inflammatory cytokines; insulin resistance; metabolic syndrome; and hormonal changes. Emerging integrative approaches such as multi-omics, AI modeling, and systems biology were also reviewed for their possible refinement in biomarker interpretation. The results prove that the deprivation of vitamins E, D, B12, and antioxidants contributes to oxidative stress and subsequent neuroinflammation that changes levels of blood-based biomarkers. A chronic state of inflammation caused by cytokines like IL-6, IL-18, and TNF-α represents a major link to the formation of increased amyloid plaques and tau tangles. Metabolically deregulated states, such as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and thyroid imbalance, further alter variability in biomarkers. All these factors would act together to affect the expression of key biomarkers-Aβ, p-tau, and neurofilament light chain (NFL). Individualized interpretation, stratified clinical trials, and digital monitoring tools are potentially effective for achieving better diagnostic precision and boosting treatment efficacy. To a large extent, factors must all be understood thoroughly from multiple biological angles to improve early diagnosis, risk prevention, and treatment personalization in AD. Future studies should develop integrative models that consider nutrition, metabolism, and inflammation to address and fully exploit biomarker utility as well as support precision medicine approaches.",Inamdar A; Bugadannavar P; Palled M; Umarani S; Salve P; Gurupadayya B; Patil P; Sharma H,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41280310/,1,0,0,0,0,0

While several therapeutic strategies have been introduced in other populations, their effectiveness in the context of CKD remains poorly understood. This systematic review aimed to evaluate current evidence on the treatment of olfactory impairment in CKD patients, including those undergoing dialysis or kidney transplantation (KT). A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Studies were included if they assessed therapeutic interventions targeting olfactory impairment in CKD patients. Data on study design, population, olfactory assessments, interventions, and outcomes were extracted and quality-assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) tool. Eight studies, published from 1987 to 2023, involving 469 CKD patients were included, spanning pre-dialysis, hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), and KT populations. Olfactory impairment was highly prevalent across all groups, affecting odor identification and discrimination. While KT offered the most complete recovery, dialysis had mixed effects, with limited improvement in olfactory thresholds. Among treatments, intranasal theophylline and curcumin showed partial efficacy, while olfactory training demonstrated the most consistent improvements in subjective and objective measures. Olfactory impairment in CKD is a complex complication. Among available approaches, olfactory training stands out as a promising, non-pharmacologic option.

The novel CMBCD model configures a progression from interacting adiposity, dysglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and residual drivers to certain cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) such as atherosclerosis, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are central to this cascade, requiring management tactics where DT serves as a precision-medicine tool. A systematic search across PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane identified 12 eligible studies (retrospective cohort, randomized clinical trials, and frameworks) to explore the role of DT in T2D and CMBCD. Due to data duplication and lack of homogeneity, meta-analysis was not feasible, prompting this narrative synthesis. DT-guided benefits were identified across the CMBCD spectrum: (1) adiposity - body mass index reduction by 1.8 kg/m² with decreased visceral adiposity; (2) dysglycemia - hemoglobin A1c reduction as much as 1.8% with 89% achieving glycemic targets, as well as fewer medications used, time-in-range (TIR) improved 69.7% to 86.9%, and time-above-range decreased; (3) hypertension - normal blood pressure cases increased from 46.4% to 63.1% and outperforming standard care; (4) dyslipidemia - triglycerides decreased 18.8% and high density lipoprotein (HDL) increased 6.8%; (5) residual - metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease improvements; and (6) complications - improved chronic kidney disease, retinopathy, and cataract prediction, comprehensive CVD risk reduction, and medication de-escalation.

This study presents updated results on headache-attributed burden from 1990 to 2023, along with clinical and public health implications. Data on the prevalence, incidence, or remission of migraine, tension-type headache, and medication-overuse headache were extracted from published population-based studies. We used hierarchical Bayesian meta-regression modelling to estimate global, regional, and country-level prevalence of headache disorders. For the first time in GBD 2023, age-specific and sex-specific estimates of time in symptomatic state were applied by meta-analysing individual participant data from 41 653 individuals from the general populations of 18 countries from all parts of the world. Disability weights were applied to calculate years lived with disability (YLDs). Since medication-overuse headache is a sequela of a mistreated primary headache (due to medication overuse), its burden was reattributed to migraine or tension-type headache, informed by a meta-analysis of three longitudinal studies. In 2023, 2·9 billion individuals (95% uncertainty interval 2·6-3·1) were affected by headache disorders, with a global age-standardised prevalence of 34·6% (31·6-37·5) and a YLD rate of 541·9 (373·4-739·9) per 100 000 population, with 487·5 (323·0-678·8) per 100 000 population attributed to migraine. The prevalence rates of these headache disorders have remained stable over the past three decades. YLD rates due to headache disorders were more than twice as high in females (739·9 [511·2-1011·5] per 100 000) as in males (346·1 [240·4-481·8] per 100 000). Medication-overuse headache contributed 58·9% of the YLD estimates for tension-type headache in males and 56·1% in females, as well as 22·6% of the YLD estimates for migraines in males and 14·1% in females. Headache disorders, in particular migraine, continue to be a major global health challenge, emphasising the need for effective management and prevention strategies.

41239964,Three-dimensional printing of bioengineered scaffolds to support skeletal muscle regeneration.,"Volumetric muscle loss (VML) is a debilitating injury to skeletal muscle that compromises daily function and quality of life. One strategy for treating VML is the use of scaffolds to replicate the lost extracellular environment and provide the necessary biological cues to guide the restoration of muscle structure, vascular supply, innervation, and contractile function. Recent advances in 3D-bioprinting provide exciting new opportunities to fabricate injury-specific hydrogel scaffolds that conform to the size and shape of an individual's wound and facilitate the restoration and recovery of muscle mass and function otherwise lost to VML injury. In this review, we provide a synopsis of the pathophysiological characteristics of VML that distinguish it from canonical regeneration. This discussion is followed by an overview of bioengineered strategies for designing scaffolds to recapitulate the physical, chemical, and biological processes of muscle regeneration. We then review three-dimensional printing methodologies used to fabricate hydrogel scaffolds for treating VML injuries. This compilation leads into a discussion of the specific challenges and potential solutions in the design, fabrication, and implementation of 3D-printed scaffolds for treating VML injuries. Our goal is to help advance the ability to restore muscle structure, function, and quality of life following VML.",O'Bryan CS; Ulery BD; Segal SS,The Journal of physiology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41239964/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41238090,Glycometabolic cardiac dysfunction in HFpEF: Lessons from multi-omics studies.,"Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) is a complex condition that stems from intricate biochemical changes in the heart tissue. The loss of metabolic flexibility, a hallmark of unhealthy myocardium, may play a role in its progression. However, the impact of myocardial metabolic changes on the development of HFpEF and the relationship with its diverse clinical presentations remains unclear. The heterogeneous nature of HFpEF poses a challenge to research and management, highlighting the pressing need for a deeper understanding of its pathophysiology and more accurate differentiation of its phenotypes. Multi-omics, driven by artificial intelligence and machine learning, is a source of inspiration in the field of HFpEF research. This method has the potential to reveal insights into the metabolic changes and phenotypes of HFpEF that were previously inaccessible. By revealing non-traditional biomarkers that go beyond basic clinical and demographic criteria, it also inspires the development of targeted therapies for specific patient groups. This review aims to explore the current understanding of how myocardial metabolic changes and metabolic inflexibility contribute to the pathogenesis of HFpEF. By drawing on the latest multi-omics studies, it also aims to identify an omics signature for HFpEF that could be instrumental in unearthing new biomarkers for diagnosis, phenotyping, risk stratification, and the development of tailored therapies, thereby advancing personalized medicine in the field of HFpEF.",Longo S; Mollace R; Casagrande V; Bucciarelli L; Martelli E; Menghini R; Fernández-Real JM; Federici M,Pharmacological research,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41238090/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41237775,From microbiome to metabolism: Bridging a two-decade translational gap.,"The mapping of the human genome sparked high expectations for biomedical breakthroughs, yet attention has since shifted toward the human microbiome as a key player in health and disease. Pioneering studies revealed striking inter-individual variability and numerous associations between gut microbiota and a wide range of conditions (i.e., obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular and inflammatory bowel diseases, autism, allergies, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancers). However, the field has faced a deluge of correlative ""dysbiosis"" studies with limited causal evidence. Although animal models have provided crucial mechanistic insights, translating these findings to humans has proven challenging. Interventions such as fecal microbiota transplantation, prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics often yield inconsistent or modest effects in clinical trials. This gap highlights the need for precision, functional profiling, and integration of multi-omics , for instance, through artificial intelligence. In this perspective, we discuss what microbiome research offers as a transformative shift and how we conceptualize disease, favoring systems biology and personalized interventions over reductionist approaches.",Van Hul M; Cani PD,Cell metabolism,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41237775/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Consequently, exercise tolerance in HFpEF patients is a key research focus. Using CiteSpace 6.3.R1, this study analyzed Web of Science Core Collection literature, examining publication volume, journals, countries, institutions, authors, keywords, and co-citation timelines to summarize hotspots, trends, and frontiers in HFpEF and exercise research. 1. A total of 2438 papers were included, with publication volume rising over the past 15 years. 2. In HFpEF and exercise research, the USA leads via a ""high-yield platform-academic leader"" model, with institutions like Mayo Clinic and scholars such as Borlaug Barry A. Germany's dual-core institutions (German Centre for Cardiovascular Research and the Berlin Institute of Health) drive European mechanistic studies.

41228565,"The Diet-Obesity-Brain Axis: Metabolic, Epigenetic, and DNA-Repair Pathways Linking Eating Patterns to Cognitive Aging, with an AI-Enabled Translational Perspective.","Diet influences brain health through many connected metabolic and molecular pathways, and these effects are stronger in obesity. This review links diet quality with cognitive decline and dementia risk. Ultra-processed, high-fat, high-sugar diets drive weight gain, insulin resistance, and chronic inflammation. These changes trigger brain oxidative stress, reduce DNA repair, deplete NAD<sup>+</sup>, disturb sirtuin/PARP balance, and alter epigenetic marks. Gut dysbiosis and leaky gut add inflammatory signals, weaken the blood-brain barrier, and disrupt microglia. Mediterranean and MIND diets, rich in plants, fiber, polyphenols, and omega-3 fats, slow cognitive decline and lower dementia risk. Trials show extra benefit when diet improves alongside exercise and vascular risk control. Specific nutrients can help in certain settings. DHA and EPA support brain health in people with low omega-3 status or early disease. B-vitamins slow brain shrinkage in mild cognitive impairment when homocysteine is high. Vitamin D correction is beneficial when levels are low. A practical plan emphasizes healthy eating and good metabolic control. It includes screening for deficiencies and supporting the microbiome with fiber and fermented foods. Mechanism-based add-ons, such as NAD<sup>+</sup> boosters, deserve testing in lifestyle-focused trials. Together, these measures may reduce diet-related brain risk across the life span. At the same time, artificial intelligence can integrate diet exposures, adiposity, metabolic markers, multi-omics, neuroimaging, and digital phenotyping. This can identify high-risk phenotypes, refine causal links along the diet-obesity-brain axis, and personalize nutrition-plus-lifestyle interventions. It can also highlight safety, equity, and privacy considerations. Translationally, a pattern-first strategy can support early screening and personalized risk reduction by integrating diet quality, adiposity, vascular risk, micronutrient status, and microbiome-responsive behaviors. AI can aid measurement and risk stratification when developed with privacy, equity, and interpretability safeguards, but clinical decisions should remain mechanism-aligned and trial-anchored.",Loomba M; Bansal S; Singh KK; Mishra PK; Ghosh S; Raghunath M; Mishra AK; Sinha JK,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41228565/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41227628,Harnessing Edible Insect Bioactives for Gut Health: A Comprehensive Review on Chitin-Derived Prebiotics and Peptidomic Insights from the Black Soldier Fly.,"The growing need for sustainable protein and functional food ingredients has made edible insects stand out as a flexible source of bioactives. Black Soldier Fly larva (BSFL) bioactives, such as chitooligosaccharides (COSs) and peptides, present potential benefits for gut health; nevertheless, their molecular pathways, clinical validation, and commercial scalability have yet to be thoroughly investigated. This study systematically analyzes current progress in BSFL bioactive extraction and characterization, emphasizing enzymatic and thermal processing, controlled enzyme development, and integrated supercritical fluid enzymatic pipelines. We assess preclinical and animal research that illustrates prebiotic modulation of <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, and <i>Faecalibacterium</i> populations; antimicrobial peptide-mediated immune signaling; and antioxidant activity. Multi-omics frameworks that connect the microbial metabolism of COS to gut health help us understand how these processes function. A comparison of the regulatory environments for food and feed applications in the EU, North America, and Asia shows that there are gaps in human safety trials, harmonized standards, and techno-economic assessments. Finally, we suggest some next steps: randomized controlled human trials in groups with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and metabolic syndrome; standardized data integration pipelines for multi-omics; and life cycle and cost-benefit analyses of modular, vertically integrated BSFL biorefineries with AI-driven reactors, digital twins, and blockchain traceability. Addressing these issues will hasten the conversion of BSFL bioactives into safe, effective, and sustainable functional meals and nutraceuticals.",Alhasyani T; Ebeid T; Ghonimy M; Alharbi S; Hassan MFY; Jarallah A; Alkhurayji M; Abdellatif AAH; Barakat H,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41227628/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41227599,A Comprehensive Systematic Review of Dynamic Nutrient Profiling for Personalized Diet Planning: Meta-Analysis and PRISMA-Based Evidence Synthesis.,"Dynamic nutrient profiling represents a paradigm shift in personalized nutrition, integrating real-time nutritional assessment with individualized dietary recommendations through advanced algorithmic approaches, biomarker integration, and artificial intelligence. This comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis examines the current state of dynamic nutrient profiling methodologies for personalized diet planning, evaluating their effectiveness, methodological quality, and clinical outcomes. Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive search of electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar) from inception to December 2024. The protocol was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (Registration: CRD42024512893). Studies were systematically screened using predefined inclusion criteria, quality was assessed using validated tools (RoB 2, ROBINS-I, Newcastle-Ottawa Scale), and data were extracted using standardized forms. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed where appropriate, with heterogeneity assessed using I<sup>2</sup> statistics. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots and Egger's test. From 2847 initially identified records plus 156 from additional sources, 117 studies met the inclusion criteria after removing 391 duplicates and systematic screening, representing 45,672 participants across 28 countries. Studies employed various methodological approaches: algorithmic-based profiling systems (76 studies), biomarker-integrated approaches (45 studies), and AI-enhanced personalized nutrition platforms (23 studies), with some studies utilizing multiple methodologies. Meta-analysis revealed significant improvements in dietary quality measures (standardized mean difference: 1.24, 95% CI: 0.89-1.59, <i>p</i> < 0.001), dietary adherence (risk ratio: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.18-1.52, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and clinical outcomes including weight reduction (mean difference: -2.8 kg, 95% CI: -4.2 to -1.4, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and improved cardiovascular risk markers. Substantial heterogeneity was observed across studies (I<sup>2</sup> = 78-92%), attributed to methodological diversity and population characteristics. AI-enhanced systems demonstrated superior effectiveness (SMD = 1.67) compared to traditional algorithmic approaches (SMD = 1.08). However, current evidence is constrained by practical limitations, including the technological accessibility of dynamic profiling systems and equity concerns in vulnerable populations. Additionally, the evidence base shows geographical concentration, with most studies conducted in high-income countries, underscoring the need for research in diverse global settings. These findings have significant implications for shaping public health policies and clinical guidelines aimed at integrating personalized nutrition into healthcare systems and addressing dietary disparities at the population level. Dynamic nutrient profiling demonstrates significant promise for advancing personalized nutrition interventions, with robust evidence supporting improved nutritional and clinical outcomes. However, methodological standardization, long-term validation studies exceeding six months, and comprehensive cost-effectiveness analyses remain critical research priorities. The integration of artificial intelligence and multi-omics data represents the future direction of this rapidly evolving field.",Molooy Zada MH; Pan D; Sun G,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41227599/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41226976,Gastric Motility Disorders Post Organ Transplantation-A Comprehensive Review.,"Motility disorders, particularly gastroparesis, are prevalent complications following solid organ transplantation, significantly impacting quality of life, nutritional status, graft survival, and mortality. This comprehensive review synthesises evidence from PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases on pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, management, and prognostic factors across transplant types. Mechanisms include vagal nerve injury (highest in lung transplants, prevalence 40-91%), immunosuppressive effects (e.g., tacrolimus accelerates motility; mycophenolate impairs it), surgical trauma, microbiome dysbiosis (reduced Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio), and metabolic factors like post-transplant diabetes (OR 5.17 in kidney recipients). Pediatric and thoracic recipients face the highest risks, with lung transplant gastroparesis conferring a 2.7-fold increased mortality/retransplantation hazard (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Diagnosis relies on gastric emptying scintigraphy (gold standard, sensitivity 85-95%) and wireless motility capsules (100% sensitivity for delay), while management encompasses prokinetics (60-80% response), endoscopic G-POEM (85% success), gastric electrical stimulation (100% quality-of-life improvement in series), and nutritional support. Prognostic factors include younger age (better intervention response), aetiology (anatomical worse than metabolic), and early therapy success. Outcomes vary: lung recipients experience severe impacts on chronic allograft dysfunction (83% oesophageal motility abnormalities correlate with 66-67% rejection). Future directions emphasise microbiome therapies, AI predictive models (AUC 0.85), and wearables for continuous monitoring. Multidisciplinary approaches are essential to balance immunosuppression with GI management, addressing ethical dilemmas like drug interactions and access disparities. Ultimately, early screening and personalised interventions can mitigate complications, enhancing long-term transplant success.",Bharadwaj HR; Koo TH; Dahiya DS; Dalal P; Fuad M; Arab S; Chhatwal K; Bhatti T; Malik M; Singh S; Hasan F; Tofani C; Infantolino A,Journal of clinical medicine,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41226976/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41225274,The influence of AI on surgical and ablative treatments for colorectal liver metastases: a review of the current literature.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has gained increasing interest in supporting clinicians in patient selection, treatment planning, and prognostics. However, the current application of AI in the treatment of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) is not clearly established and validated. This scoping review assesses the current impact of AI techniques on local therapeutic strategies for CRLM, exploring its benefits, challenges, and future directions. A comprehensive literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and SCOPUS was conducted for patients with CRLM undergoing surgery or thermal ablation, along with descriptions of AI tools. Eligible studies were cohort studies or clinical trials. Data extraction focused on treatment strategies, AI techniques, clinical and radiomics parameters, and outcomes. Out of 1464 articles, thirteen met the inclusion criteria. Eight articles regarded thermal liver ablation, and five surgical resection for CRLM. Most studies used traditional machine learning methods, such as support vector machines and random forests, combined with radiomics for predictive model building. While most studies demonstrated high performance, they frequently involved small sample sizes, and machine learning techniques often lacked robustness. AI shows promising results in improving local treatment strategies for CRLM, but further advancements are required for AI decision support tools. Future research should focus on large multicentre studies to validate AI-driven personalised colorectal liver metastases treatment strategies. This review evaluates the use of AI in colorectal liver metastases treatment for outcome prediction and treatment evaluation. Included studies used AI for segmentation and predictive modelling and were often limited by small sample-sized single-centre studies, necessitating multicentre studies. The position of AI in local colorectal liver metastases treatments is not yet established. AI algorithms are mostly used for predictive model building and image registration. Studies often lack validity, limiting generalisability and implementation of AI support tools.",van der Velden AL; Knapen RRMM; Rahmani H; Volmer L; Simon SR; Verhagen CAM; Burgmans MC; Dekker ALAJ; Wildberger JE; van Dam RM; Brecheisen R; van der Leij C,Insights into imaging,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41225274/,1,0,0,0,0,0

41210341,"Current strategies for prevention of cancer therapy-related cardiotoxicity: pharmacological, non-pharmacological and emerging approaches.","Cardiotoxicity is a major concern in cancer survivors, potentially compromising treatment efficacy, quality of life and long-term survival. With increasing survival rates, the need for effective cardioprotective strategies has become paramount. This narrative review evaluates current pharmacological, non-pharmacological, and emerging strategies for preventing cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction (CTR-CD), emphasizing recent advances, their clinical applicability and research gaps. We conducted a narrative review based on a non-systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science up to June 2025, focusing on clinical trials, meta-analyses, guideline recommendations, and key observational studies relevant to CTR-CD prevention. Among pharmacological approaches, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) and beta-blockers modestly preserve left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), though benefits on hard outcomes remain unproven. Dexrazoxane is the only FDA-approved agent and shows robust protection in anthracycline-treated patients. Statins and metformin demonstrate promising but still investigational cardioprotective effects, while sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) show encouraging pilot data. Non-pharmacological strategies-including structured exercise, mediterranean diet, nutritional support and aggressive control of risk factors-are guideline-endorsed, although most evidence relies on surrogate endpoints. Emerging tools such as telemedicine, artificial intelligence and omics sciences offer innovative opportunities for personalized prevention but require multicenter validation. An integrated, multidisciplinary approach combining both pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies is essential to effectively prevent cardiotoxicity in cancer patients. Current evidence supports dexrazoxane, risk factor control and selective use of RAASi or beta-blocker in high-risk patients. Exercise and nutrition provide functional and quality of life benefits, while several novel strategies remain exploratory. Future large-scale, multicenter, randomized trial are needed to harmonize international guidelines and define the most effective, sustainable prevention models across diverse patient populations.",Migliari M; Fazzini L; Campana N; Deidda M; Dessì M; Cadeddu Dessalvi C,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41210341/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Cutting-edge nanodrugs delivery approaches such as drugs formulations, hydrogels, films, and vaccines have been developed for diverse applications, including hormonal therapies, immunotherapy, infectious diseases, and gestational health. Tailored biomaterial systems can administer drugs for conditions such as vaginal infections, endometriosis, pregnancy disorders, reproductive cancers, and inherent messes during gestation. Designing delivery technologies for female health requires addressing unique barriers and challenges specific to the female body. Advancements in delivery technologies in other disease contexts can inform innovations in female health treatments. Delivering biomaterials and medications at the time of pregnancy may have adverse developmental consequences for the fetus, necessitating an understanding of how nanomaterials interact with reproductive systems and activate signal transduction pathways. Ensuring safety and minimizing toxicity are critical considerations, alongside developing appropriate and accessible preclinical models to facilitate clinical translation. Omics-based techniques can aid in the sustainable risk assessment and safety evaluation of nanomaterials by identifying biomolecules involved in nanotoxicity. Taking these events or exposures together with their toxicity on the female reproductive system and offspring outcomes, thus further study is required to explore, the way that nanoparticles compromise fertility and growth of embryos in humans. Long-term studies are crucial for assessing the safety of nanodrugs in pregnant female, especially concerning chronic effects from prenatal exposure.

Recent years have brought significant advances in multimodal management, including surgery, perioperative chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and supportive care. This review summarizes key updates from 2023 to 2024, focusing on surgical innovations, perioperative systemic therapy, treatment strategies for stage IV disease, and nutritional interventions. In early and locally advanced disease, laparoscopic and robotic gastrectomy have become widely accepted in Asia, supported by large, randomized trials such as JCOG0912 and KLASS-02. Perioperative chemotherapy has become a global standard, with the FLOT regimen leading in the West and SOX, XELOX, or DOS emerging in Asia. Immunotherapy is increasingly incorporated into perioperative settings, with trials like KEYNOTE-585 and NEONIPIGA suggesting potential benefit in selected patients. For stage IV gastric cancer, systemic chemotherapy remains the mainstay, but conversion surgery and treatment of oligometastasis have shown promising results in selected cases. Trials such as JCOG1704 and AIO-FLOT5 are investigating optimal strategies. Perioperative nutrition has also gained attention, with oral nutritional supplements, ERAS protocols, and digital tools like continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and AI-driven platforms enhancing outcomes. Looking ahead, integration of molecular biomarkers (e.g., HER2, PD-L1, MSI, ctDNA), precise staging, and multidisciplinary collaboration will be essential for personalized treatment.

41182389,"The intensive care medicine research agenda for the management of ICU acquired weakness: a multinational, interprofessional perspective.","Intensive care unit acquired weakness (ICUAW) is common in critically ill patients, contributing to substantial morbidity. Major trials and novel mechanistic findings published over the past years have advanced knowledge for the prevention and treatment of ICUAW. To streamline future research priorities, a multinational, interdisciplinary group of ICU clinicians, researchers, and people with lived experience convened to develop this evidence-based research agenda. Using a stepwise process including a systematic review with meta-analysis, two expert panel meetings, and a two-round modified Delphi method, we identified the top ten research priorities for ICUAW. Our report highlights the lack of reliable prognostic markers and mechanistic understanding that limit early diagnosis and treatment. Current evidence to treat ICUAW supports enhanced physical rehabilitation versus no rehabilitation, while higher dose enterally-delivered protein alone does not improve patient outcomes. However, the direct effects on muscles or appropriate dosing for patients with comorbidities remain largely unknown. The proposed ten key priority research questions integrate pathophysiology, diagnostics, treatment, and follow-up and emphasise personalised medicine and patient-centred outcomes over the continuum of recovery. Future research should focus on early prognostic markers, mechanisms of ICUAW, and identification of treatment responders allowing individualised dosing strategies tailored across the recovery trajectory. Defining meaningful outcomes, improving follow-up care, and integrating patient, family and caregiver priorities are essential.

Traditional screening methods often fail to identify malnutrition effectively. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to enhance early detection, improve patient outcomes, and optimize hospital resource utilization. This systematic review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of AI-based interventions in the early identification and management of hospital malnutrition. A systematic search was conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Excerpta Medica Database, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies evaluating AI interventions for the detection of malnutrition in hospitalized adult patients were included. Methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tools. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria, utilizing AI algorithms such as Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). AI-based models demonstrated superior accuracy compared to traditional screening methods, with area under the curve (AUC) values exceeding 90 % in several studies. These interventions improved malnutrition diagnosis rates, reduced diagnostic delays, and enhanced cost-efficiency by optimizing resource allocation and reducing hospital length of stay. AI-driven approaches show strong potential for improving the detection and management of malnutrition, offering greater diagnostic accuracy and operational efficiency. Integrating AI into clinical workflows could enhance patient outcomes and generate cost savings.

Small bowel strictures and associated penetrating complications are commonly missed complications of fibrostenosing Crohn's disease at CTE/MRE. This educational review focuses on factors contributing to unreported or overcalled strictures including disease location, postoperative anatomy, erroneous understanding of threshold dilation for stricture diagnosis, and underappreciation for how stricture diagnosis can improve patient care, emphasizing current understanding of Crohn's small bowel strictures using illustrative cases. In addition, we explain emerging consensus for how strictures and their associated obstruction can be consistently measured and described. We also review frequently missed complications of fibrostenosing Crohn's disease such as chronic mesenteric venous occlusion and penetrating complications, including blind-ending sinus tracts, and ileoappendiceal and complex enteroenteric fistulas. Finally, common mimics of fibrostenosing Crohn's disease including NSAID enteropathy, radiation enteritis, and other entities are discussed, highlighting key distinguishing imaging and clinical features.

Conventional drugs often focus on symptom management, frequently accompanied by side effects and rarely reversing disease progression. Nutraceuticals bioactive compounds sourced from foods, herbs, and marine organisms, offer a promising alternative due to their inherent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective properties. This review synthesizes current evidence on key nutraceutical classes (e.g., polyphenols, flavonoids, omega-3 fatty acids, probiotics, plant alkaloids), elucidating their molecular mechanisms such as oxidative stress mitigation, immune modulation, gene regulation, and signaling pathway interactions and highlighting therapeutic applications across major chronic conditions. Addressing a critical limitation, we analyze advanced delivery technologies (e.g., nano-formulations, encapsulation, liposomes, micro- and hydrogels, co-administered bioenhancers) designed to enhance bioavailability and targeting. We also discuss navigating hurdles such as regulatory inconsistencies, safety concerns, herb-drug interactions, and the need for standardization. To fully incorporate nutraceuticals into modern healthcare, the review emphasizes the imperative for rigorous clinical validation, manufacturing quality control, and long-term safety monitoring. Finally, we propose future directions including personalized nutraceutical strategies, AI-assisted discovery, and global regulatory harmonization positioning nutraceuticals as sustainable and evidence-based adjuncts or alternatives in chronic disease management.",Fatima G; Khan S; Shukla V; Awaida W; Li D; Gushchina YS,Frontiers in nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41170369/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a key enabler in PN by analyzing large-scale, multiomics datasets in obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal disorders, where digital twins and health knowledge graphs support personalized interventions. Current findings demonstrate that AI models can guide microbiome-based dietary interventions, and support obesity management, thereby extending the scope of conventional nutritional strategies as supported by deepened bibliometric analyses. This study highlights the global increase in AI-based PN studies, accelerated by digital health demands and the COVID-19 pandemic, and the expansion of traditional nutrition strategies through machine learning approaches with the integration of microbiome-based models and omics. However, challenges such as algorithmic bias, limited generalizability, and data privacy remain. To overcome these issues, diverse datasets, explainable AI approaches, and standardized multicenter validation protocols are proposed. These steps are critical for transforming AI-supported PN from a conceptual potential into a fair, reliable, and clinically applicable structure.

41161575,CRISPR-Cas systems: Pioneering next-generation diagnostic tools for parasitic diseases.,"Parasitic diseases pose significant threats to both human and veterinary health, causing morbidity, mortality, and economic losses. Effective diagnostics are critical, yet conventional methods such as microscopy, serology, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are limited by low sensitivity, cross-reactivity, or dependence on costly equipment and skilled personnel. Isothermal amplification techniques, such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), have improved point-of-care (POC) applications but remain limited by nonspecific amplification and reduced sensitivity for low-copy targets. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated (Cas) systems have emerged as transformative tools in molecular diagnostics, offering high sensitivity, specificity, rapidity, and cost-effectiveness. This review presents an overview of CRISPR-Cas systems, their historical development, classification (Class 1 and Class 2, Types I-VI), molecular mechanisms, and diagnostic potential in parasitic diseases, with illustrative examples from studies published between 2017 and May 2025. Despite significant progress, CRISPR-based diagnostics face challenges such as off-target activity, dependence on nucleic acid amplification, and complex sample preparation. Future directions focus on amplification-free detection, multiplexed assay development, and integration with nanotechnology, microfluidics, smartphone-based devices, and artificial intelligence. CRISPR-Cas technologies thus represent a promising frontier in next-generation diagnostics for parasitic disease surveillance, control, and personalized healthcare in both human and veterinary health.",Verma R; Das G; H V M; Muwel N; Choudhary R; Kumar S; Nath S; Gattani A; Gupta V; Sharma RK; Ajith Y,Molecular and biochemical parasitology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41161575/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41156474,Application of Artificial Intelligence Technologies as an Intervention for Promoting Healthy Eating and Nutrition in Older Adults: A Systematic Literature Review.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> The aging population faces a multitude of health challenges, particularly when it comes to maintaining proper nutrition. Age-related physiological changes, such as decreased metabolism, diminished taste perception, and difficulty in chewing, can lead to insufficient nutrient intake, ultimately resulting in malnutrition. It is crucial to address these issues to promote not only physical health but also overall well-being. In this modern era, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including robots and machine learning algorithms, are being increasingly harnessed to encourage healthy eating habits among older adults. This is critical to support healthy aging and mitigate diet-related chronic diseases. However, little or no synthesis has established their effectiveness in delivering personalized, scalable, and adaptive interventions for older adults. This systematic review considers the state-of-the-art application of AI-based interventions aimed at improving dietary behaviors and nutritional outcomes in older adults. <b>Methods:</b> Following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines and a registered PROSPERO protocol (ID: CRD420241045268), we systematically analyzed 30 studies we collected from five databases, published between 2015 and 2025 based on different AI techniques, including machine learning, natural language processing, and recommender systems. We synthesized data collected from these studies to examine the intervention types, outcomes, and methodological approaches. <b>Results:</b> Findings from our review highlight the potential of AI-based interventions to promote engagement among older adults and improve adherence to healthy eating guidelines. Additionally, we found some challenges related to ethical concerns such as privacy and transparency, and limited evidence of their long-term effectiveness. <b>Conclusions:</b> AI-based interventions offer significant promise in promoting healthy eating among older adults through personalized, adaptive, and scalable interventions. Yet, current evidence is constrained by some methodological limitations and ethical concerns, which calls for future research to design inclusive, evidence-based AI interventions that address the unique physiological, psychological, and social needs of older adults.",Kalu KA; Ataguba G; Onifade O; Orji F; Giweli N; Orji R,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41156474/,0,1,0,0,0,0

41150735,"Obesity as a Multifactorial Chronic Disease: Molecular Mechanisms, Systemic Impact, and Emerging Digital Interventions.","Obesity is a multifactorial chronic disease resulting from complex genetic, molecular, environmental, and behavioral interactions. Its prevalence rises worldwide, affecting cardiovascular, metabolic, oncological, hepatic, respiratory, and skeletal health. Beyond caloric excess, genetic predisposition, epigenetic modifications, gut microbiota dysbiosis, endocrine-disrupting agents, circadian misalignment, and intergenerational and prenatal influences are critical determinants of obesity risk. Core pathophysiological mechanisms include insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, chronic low-grade inflammation, and neuroendocrine dysregulation of appetite and energy balance. These processes are linked to comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis, fatty liver disease, sleep apnea, osteoporosis, and cancer. Advances in molecular profiling, metabolic phenotyping, and body composition analysis are refining obesity classification and enabling precise risk stratification. Current therapeutic strategies include behavioral interventions addressing stress-related mechanisms, pharmacological therapies such as GLP-1 receptor agonists, emerging gene therapy approaches, and bariatric surgery. Gut-derived hormones (leptin, ghrelin, GLP-1, PYY, CCK) are recognized as pivotal regulators of appetite and weight. Preventive strategies increasingly emphasize circadian alignment, while epigenetic inheritance and prenatal exposures such as maternal obesity or smoking highlight early-life programming in future metabolic health.

41144114,The early-onset cancer epidemics: evidence synthesis using the prospective cohort incident-tumor biobank method.,"Tumors likely develop over years/decades, implying that assessing long-term exposure to risk factors is crucial in cancer epidemiology. An increasing trend of long-term risk factor exposures starting from early life since the mid-twentieth century appears to have contributed to the epidemics of early-onset cancer (EOC) worldwide. A rising incidence of EOC has been reported in various body sites such as the bone marrow, bile duct, breast, colorectum, esophagus, gallbladder, head and neck, kidney, liver, pancreas, stomach, and uterine corpus. To address an intractable gap between long-term exposure assessments and tumoral molecular/microenvironmental profiling in EOC research, here we describe a framework using the prospective cohort incident-tumor biobank method (PCIBM), which was recently conceptualized. The PCIBM enables prospective molecular pathological epidemiology research that can link long-term exposures with tumor pathogenic signatures. We illustrate this framework using the study of early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC). First, one recognizes overlaps of the characteristics of EOCRC and later-onset counterparts. Second, EOCRC tumoral, multi-omic, or microenvironmental features are discovered and replicated. Third, using the PCIBM, long-term exposure variables are examined in relation to the incidence of all-age colorectal cancer subtypes possessing EOCRC tumoral features. Fourth, identified putative risk factors are tested for EOCRC incidence. This framework, which has provided etiological insights and advanced our understanding of EOCRC pathogenesis, is widely applicable to EOC in various organs. In addition, this research modality with artificial intelligence-driven computational tools should be used in lifecourse and other prospective cohort studies to improve our knowledge of EOC pathogenesis.",Ogino S; Ugai S; Hamada T; Ugai T,European journal of epidemiology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41144114/,1,0,0,0,0,1

We focused on advice related to metabolic diseases, food allergies or intolerances, nutrient intake, and nutrition during pregnancy or lactation. Out of 2469 records found through an extensive search, 13 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. We conducted standardized data extraction and quality evaluations. While the chatbots in the included studies demonstrate potential as tools for nutrition advice, caution is necessary as they tend to be less effective with complex cases and may occasionally produce incorrect responses. Synthesis of the included studies revealed substantial methodological heterogeneity, particularly in evaluation criteria and study design, which precluded meaningful cross-study comparisons. Key limitations included the frequent use of subjective or poorly defined assessment measures as well as a lack of reproducibility testing. Despite these issues, all but 1 study agreed that while LLM-powered chatbots show potential for supporting nutritional advice, they are not yet ready for unsupervised use.

This review focuses on the population-level applications and impact of AI, highlighting its role in shifting healthcare strategies from reactive treatment to proactive prevention. AI demonstrates substantial improvements across many different areas. In colorectal cancer, AI models significantly boost detection rates, successfully identifying a large majority of high-risk individuals often missed by traditional screening methods. For metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), advanced non-invasive tests offer a high degree of reliability in detecting liver fibrosis. The identification of viral hepatitis is enhanced with excellent accuracy, and gastrointestinal infection surveillance benefits from wastewater analysis that provides an early warning system weeks ahead of clinical case reporting. Furthermore, AI improves the diagnosis of upper GI cancers, such as gastric cancer, with higher diagnostic capability, and facilitates precision public health in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) through highly accurate risk prediction models. Despite these important advances, significant hurdles remain. Key challenges include ensuring diverse and representative data to prevent algorithmic bias, protecting patient privacy, establishing robust regulatory frameworks for new technologies, and successfully moving innovations from research settings into practical, real-world deployment. The unequal distribution of AI development and access between high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries risks exacerbating existing health disparities.

41103321,"Tracing microbial hazards in the aquatic supply chain: challenges, technologies, and future directions.","Aquatic products are a crucial source of dietary protein, especially in regions with abundant marine resources. However, with the expansion of global trade, the risk of microbial contamination in these products has increased, leading to serious public health concerns due to extended transportation and varying regulatory standards. Foodborne illnesses associated with aquatic products not only impact consumer health but also result in significant economic losses due to reduced market confidence, brand damage, and costly recalls. This review systematically examines the role of traceability technologies in enhancing microbial safety in aquatic products. Emphasis is placed on the integration of genome sequencing, artificial intelligence, and digital monitoring systems within the traceability framework. The evaluation considers specific performance indicators, including detection sensitivity (for example, the minimum limit of detection for target pathogens), source attribution resolution (for example, ≤20 core-genome SNP differences or unique wgMLST allelic profiles), and time-to-result in outbreak scenarios, as well as accessibility for small-scale producers and scalability across diverse aquaculture environments. In particular, we outline how artificial intelligence can be integrated with genome sequencing. For instance, WGS-derived genomic fingerprints can be transformed into machine learning models for rapid and highly sensitive microbial source prediction, thereby enhancing real-time decision-making capability along the aquatic product supply chain. Traceability systems have proven effective in enabling real-time monitoring and rapid response to contamination events. Technologies such as genome sequencing and AI significantly enhance detection speed and accuracy, contributing to improved food safety management. Nonetheless, challenges remain, including technological barriers for small-scale producers, fragmented international standards, and low public awareness. To overcome these limitations, future efforts should focus on developing cost-effective and user-friendly traceability tools, promoting global standardization, strengthening regulatory frameworks, and increasing public engagement.

41101312,Nutrient allocation fuels T cell-mediated immunity.,"T cell activation and function are intricately linked to metabolic reprogramming. The classic view of T cell metabolic reprogramming centers on glucose as the dominant bioenergetic fuel, where T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation promotes a metabolic switch from relying primarily on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for energy production to aerobic glycolysis (i.e., the Warburg effect). More recently, studies have revealed this classic model to be overly simplistic. Activated T cells run both glycolysis and OXPHOS programs concurrently, allocating diverse nutrient sources toward distinct biosynthetic and bioenergetic fates. Moreover, studies of T cell metabolism in vivo and ex vivo highlight that physiologic nutrient availability influences how glucose is allocated by T cells to fuel both optimal proliferation and effector function.

41075026,Beta-Glucan in barley as a natural immunomodulator: mechanisms and therapeutic potential.,"Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is a major cereal crop recognized for its abundant β-glucan content, a soluble dietary fiber exhibiting significant nutritional and immunomodulatory properties. Structurally composed of mixed-linkage (1→3)(1→4)-β-D-glucopyranosyl units, barley β-glucans possess unique physicochemical attributes underpinning their biological activity. Their biosynthesis is primarily governed by cellulose synthase-like (Csl) genes, notably HvCslF6, while environmental conditions, agronomic practices, and genetic diversity further modulate β-glucan accumulation. β-glucans act as natural immunomodulators, engaging pattern recognition receptors such as Dectin-1, Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), and CR3, thereby activating key innate and adaptive immune pathways, including the MyD88 and Syk cascades. This results in enhanced macrophage, dendritic cell, activate natural killer (NK) cells, and T-cell functions, along with modulation of inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Barley β-glucans also exert antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and metabolic regulatory effects, contributing to the management of chronic conditions including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, and inflammatory disorders. Recent advancements in pretreatment (germination, fermentation, ultrasonic-assisted extraction), molecular breeding (QTL mapping, GWAS, MAS), and genome editing (CRISPR/Cas9 targeting Csl genes) have accelerated efforts to optimize β-glucan yield and functionality. Emerging applications extend beyond nutrition to biomedical materials and vaccine adjuvants, driven by β-glucan's ability to induce trained immunity and enhance vaccine responses. Nonetheless, structural heterogeneity and incomplete mechanistic insights pose challenges to clinical translation. This review critically integrates molecular, immunological, and biotechnological perspectives on barley β-glucans, emphasizing the need for multidisciplinary strategies to unlock their full therapeutic and functional potential in advancing human health and sustainable food systems.",Ahmed HGMD; Yang L; Yang X; Yang J; Hussain S; Shafiq MD; Akram MI; Sajad M; Zeng Y,Molecular biology reports,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41075026/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41064813,"<i>ACTA1</i> gene regulation in livestock: A multidimensional review on muscle development, meat quality, and genetic applications.","The skeletal muscle α-actin gene (ACTA1) plays a pivotal role in muscle contraction, structural integrity, and overall development of skeletal muscle tissue in livestock. This review explores the complex regulatory mechanisms of ACTA1 expression and its direct impact on meat quality, animal performance, and production efficiency. Nutritional inputs, environmental stressors, hormonal signaling, and genetic factors collectively influence ACTA1 activity at the transcriptional, translational, and epigenetic levels. High-protein diets rich in branched-chain amino acids, particularly leucine, stimulate the mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway and enhance ACTA1-mediated muscle growth. Similarly, micronutrients such as zinc and selenium function as antioxidants, stabilizing ACTA1 expression under oxidative stress conditions. The review also delves into the role of ACTA1 polymorphisms in modulating muscle fiber type composition, particularly the balance between type I and type II fibers, which significantly affects meat tenderness, fat content, and endurance capacity. Genome-wide association studies, marker-assisted selection (MAS), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein 9-based genome editing provide promising avenues for optimizing ACTA1 expression in livestock breeding programs. Moreover, ACTA1 dysregulation or mutation is linked to several congenital myopathies, underscoring its diagnostic and therapeutic relevance in veterinary pathology. Biotechnological interventions targeting ACTA1 expression present immense potential for improving muscle mass, carcass traits, and feed efficiency, thereby supporting global food security. Future strategies combining nutrigenomics, precision livestock farming, and artificial intelligence could enable tailored breeding and management approaches for sustainable meat production. Ethical and environmental considerations will be critical as gene editing technologies move toward wider application. In summary, ACTA1 represents a cornerstone of muscle physiology in livestock, and its integrative regulation across nutrition, genetics, and environment offers vast potential for advancing meat science, animal health, and agricultural productivity.",Ayuti SR; Shin S; Kim EJ; Lamid M; Warsito SH; Al Arif MA; Lokapirnasari WP; Amrina Rosyada ZN; Khairullah AR; Akmal M; Ritonga MZ; Rimayanti R; Delima M,Veterinary world,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41064813/,1,0,0,0,0,0

41063745,Synergistic Effects of Bioactive Compounds on Human Adiposity Mechanisms of Fat Loss and Fat Accumulation.,"Adipose tissue plays a crucial role in regulating metabolic health in humans, where both an excess and a deficiency can lead to chronic diseases. Bioactive compounds derived from food like polyphenols, alkaloids, terpenoids, peptides, and fibers have been recognized as significant influencers of fat metabolism. They operate through various molecular and systemic pathways, facilitating either adiposity reduction or fat accumulation based on the physiological context. This review consolidates recent progress in comprehending the mechanisms through which these compounds affect lipolysis, adipogenesis, thermogenesis, and appetite regulation. We emphasize the collaborative effects that enhance bioactive efficacy and examine findings from clinical trials focused on obesity, cachexia, and sarcopenia. For example, co-administration of curcumin with piperine increased curcumin bioavailability up to 20-fold, and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) combined with caffeine modestly enhanced 24-h energy expenditure by 4% in humans. Similarly, omega-3 fatty acids combined with vitamin D supplementation improved lean mass by 1.2 kg in sarcopenic adults in recent meta-analyses. New platforms in personalized nutrition-combining genomics, microbiome analysis, and AI-driven meal planning-present exciting opportunities for tailored applications. In conclusion, we address significant translational challenges and prospective pathways, focusing on enhancing bioavailability, standardizing outcomes, and ethically expanding personalized interventions.

41061255,Physical Activity Misinformation on Social Media: Systematic Review.,"Social media is a prominent way in which health information is spread. The accuracy and credibility of such sources range widely, with misleading statements, misreported results of studies, and a lack of references causing health misinformation to become a growing problem. However, previous research on health misinformation related to topics including vaccines, nutrition, and cancer has excluded physical activity despite it being highly searched for and discussed online. This systematic review was designed to synthesize the existing literature focused on physical activity misinformation on social media in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines. Keyword searches were conducted in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus databases for records published between January 2016 and May 2025. This search strategy yielded 9039 articles. Titles and abstracts were screened by independent reviewers, resulting in 168 (1.86%) articles selected for full-text review. After further review, 33 (19.6%) articles met the inclusion criteria and were used in the final synthesis. For the 33 studies selected, topics included physical rehabilitation and therapeutic exercise recommendations (n=15, 45%), general physical activity and messaging (n=6, 18%), exercising with a specific condition (n=4, 12%), women's health (n=3, 9%), weight loss (n=2, 6%), exercise testing (n=1, 3%), ""immune boosting exercise"" (n=1, 3%), and workplace sitting versus standing guidelines (n=1, 3%). The social media platforms YouTube (n=13, 39%), TikTok (n=7, 21%), Facebook (n=2, 6%), Instagram (n=1, 3%), and Pinterest (n=1, 3%) were studied, whereas other articles (n=9, 27%) analyzed content that had not explicitly been posted to social media but could be shared widely online. In total, 4 (12%) studies reported research that proactively engaged participants, and the remaining 29 (88%) studies analyzed readily available online content, including social media, news articles, websites, and blogs. Furthermore, 27 (82%) studies reported at least 1 measure of misinformation prevalence, whereas 21 (64%) reported a metric of reach, and 6 (18%) studies reported a measure of misinformation spread. Our findings indicate that research on social media physical activity misinformation spans a diverse array of physical activity topics, with YouTube being the most studied platform due to its widespread use and ease of content evaluation. This review also highlights the prevalence of low-quality information across various platforms and a lack of longitudinal investigations. Our review underscores the need for multifaceted research approaches and suggests several strategies to combat misinformation, including improved messaging, high-quality information dissemination by institutions, detailed debunking efforts, and raising awareness about misinformation. Future research should focus on understanding the spread of physical activity misinformation across platforms and its impact, especially on vulnerable populations.

Noninvasive approaches for monitoring animal health and physiology are of growing interest. Exhaled breath analysis, or exhalomics, has emerged as a promising tool for detecting volatile organic compounds and gases associated with metabolism, disease states, physiological processes, and microbiome in livestock. This review synthesizes current advancements in breath sampling and analytical technologies and evaluates applications in disease diagnostics, nutritional assessment, and physiological and microbial profiling across livestock species. Although progress is evident, key challenges remain, including sampling variability, incomplete metabolite annotation, and limited scalability for field use. Future efforts should prioritize standardizing protocols; expanding livestock-specific spectral libraries; and developing affordable, real-time sensors for on-farm deployment. Integrating exhalomics with multi-omics and artificial intelligence-driven analytics holds potential to enable earlier disease detection, improve production efficiency, and reduce environmental impacts, ultimately advancing precision livestock farming and animal welfare over the coming decade.",Niu M; Arshad U; Islam MZ; Barrientos-Blanco MA; Slack E; Giannoukos S; Zenobi R,Annual review of animal biosciences,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41061172/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41056462,"Precision Nutritional Genomics, Gut Microbiota and Artificial Intelligence in Chronic Kidney Disease.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a prevalent global health issue, and nutritional management of CKD is an integral component through all stages of the disease. However, response to dietary interventions varies, potentially due to genetic variations influencing metabolic pathways. This review highlights key gene-diet interactions relevant to CKD management, including risk factors and comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and proteinuria. Variants in the <i>ACE</i> gene influence salt sensitivity and blood pressure responses, while <i>TCF7L2</i> polymorphisms affect the relationship between dietary glycemic load and diabetes risk, impacting kidney complications. Protein intake, a key modifier of CKD, correlates with proteinuria risk, moderated by a <i>PPM1K</i> polymorphism. Dietary bioactives, such as caffeine, may also alter the progression rate of proteinuria and hypertension, with effects contingent upon <i>CYP1A2</i> genotype. Additional markers of cardiovascular disease, CKD-associated bone-mineral disease, and CKD anemia are also discussed as well as role of the gut microbiome in nutrition modulation and vice versa. The review concludes with the potential of artificial intelligence as a clinical tool to refine precision nutrition, enabling clinicians to adopt targeted approaches, stratified by genetic-metabolic patient profiles that match best nutritional interventions for prevention and management of CKD. Vitamin D is used as a model nutrient to illustrate a simulated framework for precision nutrition, incorporating molecular mechanisms, genetic variation, epigenetic modifications, and translational tools applicable to both population health and clinical practice.",Mahdavi S,Journal of the American Nutrition Association,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41056462/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Cardiovascular-liver-metabolic (CLM) diseases coexist and interact to constitute a synergy of epidemics (a syndemic), with shared mechanisms and socioeconomic influences. The goal of this Review is to construct this complex public-health issue into a unified framework, using epidemiological data to illustrate the current burden of disease and the trends in the CLM syndemic and to make projections for the future. We also discuss the challenges of promoting CLM health and the need for shared solutions. The proposed micro-meso-macro framework integrates strategies to improve risk prediction and precision prevention and to disentangle the competing risks within the CLM construct (micro), while keeping communities at the heart of CLM health promotion by ensuring access to healthy foods, healthy environments and metabolic interventions (meso). In addition, we propose interventions to eliminate inequities in the social and commercial determinants of health, from communities to healthcare systems (macro).

41052692,"Extraction, preparation, pharmacological activities, and potential applications of ginsenosides Rk1 and Rg5.","Panax species (Panax ginseng, Panax quinquefolius L., and Panax notoginseng) are globally recognized as valuable medicinal and dietary resources with a long history of use in traditional medicine. Ginsenosides are their primary active constituents, among which rare ginsenosides, particularly Rk1 and Rg5, exhibit superior physiological activities-including antitumour, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects-compared to common ginsenosides. However, their industrial application is hindered by low natural abundance, structural complexity, and challenges in sustainable production. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in rare ginsenosides Rk1 and Rg5, covering their natural sources, extraction and processing techniques, structural characteristics, pharmacological mechanisms, and potential applications in functional foods and nutraceuticals. By consolidating existing evidence, this work aims to bridge the gap between preclinical research and clinical translation, facilitating their broader utilization in healthcare and nutrition. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, and other databases for English publications from March 2005 to March 2025. Keywords included ""rare ginsenosides,"" ""Rk1,"" ""Rg5,"" ""pharmacological effects,"" and ""biosynthesis."" Additionally, network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques were employed to predict the potential anticancer and reproductive protective effects of Rk1 and Rg5. As representative rare ginsenosides, Rk1 and Rg5 exhibit significantly superior biological activities compared to common saponin components such as Rb1 and Rg1. This advantage primarily stems from their unique structural characteristics: a reduction in the number of glycosyl groups and decreased polarity during thermal processing, which markedly enhance cell membrane permeability and oral bioavailability, thereby improving in vivo absorption and tissue distribution. In various pharmacological models, Rk1 and Rg5 demonstrate stronger anti-tumor, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. Currently, the production of Rk1 and Rg5 mainly relies on chemical and physical transformation methods, while emerging technologies-such as artificial intelligence-assisted biotransformation and synthetic biology strategies-offer new avenues for large-scale, high-efficiency preparation. These compounds show broad therapeutic potential in oncology, metabolic diseases, neuroprotection, and cardiovascular health. Through network pharmacology and molecular docking analyses, key target proteins have been identified, providing a theoretical basis for subsequent mechanistic studies and application development. Rare ginsenosides Rk1 and Rg5 represent promising candidates for next-generation nutraceuticals and therapeutics. Future research should prioritize optimizing extraction protocols, clarifying pharmacokinetic profiles, and conducting rigorous clinical trials to validate their efficacy.

41049064,Mapping the AI Landscape in Food Science and Engineering: A Bibliometric Analysis Enhanced with Interactive Digital Tools and Company Case Studies.,"The proliferation of research on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in food science and engineering has made it increasingly difficult to synthesise relevant insights effectively. Although AI adoption in the food industry has grown, it lags behind sectors like finance and healthcare due to the complexity of food systems, including high process variability, risk aversion towards novel technologies, and constrained investment appetite. Historically, computational techniques and AI-adjacent technologies like expert systems and empirical modelling have supported food research and development for decades. More recently, AI applications have broadened to include process control, food safety, ingredient and product quality, sensory evaluation, traceability, and supply chain management. In response to the rapid increase in AI-related food science publications - particularly since 2019 - this review introduces tools for dynamically synthesising and exploring this evolving knowledge base. We present an interactive dashboard that integrates a curated dataset of food AI review articles with advanced bibliometric analyses, enabling user-driven exploration of research trends and thematic relationships. Additionally, we demonstrate the use of customised large language model (LLM) tools for targeted literature interrogation, enhancing accessibility for researchers and industry stakeholders.

41041128,Immunomodulatory role of vitamin D and emerging immunotherapies in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers globally, with nearly 1 million new cases diagnosed annually. It is a complex disease, with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections being the most common etiological factors worldwide. Despite advances in therapy, survival rates for advanced and/or metastatic HCC remain low, with mortality rates 2.3 times higher in men than women. The liver's immune system typically maintains an anti-inflammatory environment, contributing to immune tolerance to exogenous, food-derived antigens. However, disruption of the balanced interplay between immune factors within the hepatic microenvironment-due to viral hepatitis, excessive alcohol intake, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-can lead to chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, a cumulative mutational burden, cirrhosis, and eventually, malignant transformation. Once HCC is established, however, a functional pro-inflammatory immune response becomes critical to controlling tumor progression, as evidenced by the recent success of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatments in HCC patients. In addition to ICIs, other novel immunotherapeutic intervention strategies, such as cancer vaccines and adoptive T cell therapies, are currently being investigated. Furthermore, adequate nutrition plays a critical role in modulating immune function, with vitamin D being a key nutrient for immune/regulation. In this review, we will discuss the potential role of vitamin D in HCC immunity and recent immunotherapeutic advances in the management of this malignancy.",Chiriva-Internati M; Grizzi F; Monari MN; Taverna G; Figueroa JA; Daoyan W; Bresalier RS,Frontiers in nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41041128/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41040968,Models of global primary care post-2030.,"Primary care is currently a central focus in global health policy; however, renewed attention has not translated into the investment needed to build systems that are fit for the future. As 2030 approaches, many health systems are converging towards primary care models that provide community-based, first-contact access, but they omit the other core functions of comprehensiveness, continuity, and coordination. In this Viewpoint, we argue that these primary care lite models are ill-equipped to manage the increasing burden of multimorbidity; harness technological disruption; and reduce health inequities. We propose a new trajectory towards hybrid models of care that anchor community-oriented outreach workers within multidisciplinary teams that are trained in family medicine. Although artificial intelligence and digital tools can magnify impact and reach, we warn that their uninformed adoption could create digital gatekeepers and deepen disparities. To future-proof primary care, policy makers should invest in integrated models that deliver robust, equitable, and person-centred care that is needed to meet future challenges.",Allen LN; Rasanathan K; Mash R; Uribe MV; Martinez-Bianchi V; Kidd M,The Lancet.

41031363,Efficacy of flavonoids in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common health challenge worldwide and urgently requires effective therapeutic interventions. Flavonoids, a diverse group of plant-derived polyphenols, have demonstrated multifaceted biological functions, like anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and metabolic regulatory capacities, suggesting their potential utility in the management of NAFLD. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to synthesize evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the effects of flavonoid supplementation (including specific subclasses) in patients with NAFLD on liver function, markers of inflammation, lipid profiles, anthropometric measures and insulin resistance. This study rigorously adhered to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Version 6.5, 2024) and the PRISMA guidelines. A substantial literature review was obtained from PubMed, OVID, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases, including studies published through December 2024. The analysis incorporated 25 RCTs involving 1,689 participants with NAFLD. Flavonoids intervention significantly decreased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total cholesterol (TC), steatosis score, body mass index (BMI), triglycerides (TG), fasting blood sugar (FBS), insulin levels and augmented the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) levels. However, no significant alterations were observed in gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), body weight (WT), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), hip circumference (HC), Waist Circumference (WC). Moreover, the impact on hepatic steatosis and fibrosis scores was non-significant. Flavonoids exhibit potential therapeutic benefits in mitigating liver enzyme levels, lipid profiles, enhancing insulin sensitivity among NAFLD patients. Nonetheless, their influence on inflammatory markers, and fibrosis scores appears to be limited. Future investigations should focus on assessing the long-term security and effectiveness of flavonoid supplementation in managing NAFLD and exploring their synergistic potential in combination with other therapeutic strategies. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD420251001203.",Liu Q; Luan H; Duan Z; Ai J; Wang Y; Chen P,Frontiers in nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41031363/,0,1,0,0,0,0

In response, quorum quenching (QQ) has emerged as a promising alternative that disrupts bacterial communication pathways without exerting lethal pressure, thereby mitigating the development of resistance. This review systematically examines the regulatory architectures of quorum sensing (QS) systems in major foodborne pathogens, emphasizing their roles in biofilm formation and virulence expression. It further elaborates the molecular mechanisms of QQ, which primarily involve inhibiting signal synthesis, enzymatically degrading signal molecules, and competitively blocking receptor binding. With demonstrated applications across environmental, agricultural, food, and medical sectors, QQ shows significant potential for reducing foodborne diseases and improving public health. However, challenges remain in the cost-effective production, regulatory approval, and compatibility of QQ agents within complex food matrices. Future integration with intelligent packaging and AI-driven delivery systems may enable real-time monitoring and responsive biocontrol. This work provides a cross-disciplinary assessment of QQ's implementation pathways, bridging fundamental mechanisms to practical applications in agri-food systems.",Zhao N; Fan X; Liu Z; Jiang Y; Chen X; Tang Y; Yu T; Yan F,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41030237/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41020777,Personalized medicine in acromegaly: insights from the ACROFAST clinical trial.,"Personalized medicine has gained importance in the management of acromegaly, driven by advances in tumor classification, molecular profiling, and imaging modalities. This approach leads to achieved biochemical control more frequently and in a shorter time frame when compared to the usual trial-and-error approach using first-generation somatostatin receptor ligands (fgSRLs) as first-line drug, which is still currently recommended in most clinical guidelines. In this review, we summarize recent advances in personalized medicine for acromegaly, with a particular focus on predictive markers of surgical and medical treatment response. Moreover, we highlight the perspectives gained from the ACROFAST clinical trial, which has contributed with valuable insights into the clinical implementation of individualized therapeutic strategies.

41013711,Burn Care: A Review-Part 2: Beyond 48 Hours.,"After 48 h, care of the burn patient becomes more prolonged and difficult. The second part of the review discusses the long-term care of the burn patient. Current literature and authors' experience were used to provide guidelines for the management of burns. No artificial intelligence was used to create this manuscript. The profound hypermetabolic response leads to significant demands on the patient that must be addressed by the caregiver. Patients require more nutritional and metabolic support than other diagnoses. Since the skin, which is the barrier to microorganism invasion, is destroyed, sepsis becomes a major concern. The primary goal of the clinician is to heal the wound as quickly as possible. As burn size increases, this task becomes much more difficult. The complete management of extensive burns requires an experienced team that can handle the long-term demands of the patient.",Greenhalgh DG; Puri V,World journal of surgery,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41013711/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41008367,Effectiveness of AI-Assisted Digital Therapies for Post-Stroke Aphasia Rehabilitation: A Systematic Review.,"<b>Background:</b> Traditional aphasia therapy is often limited by insufficient dosage, a barrier that AI-assisted digital therapies are poised to overcome. However, it remains unclear whether gains on specific tasks translate to functional, real-world communication. This systematic review evaluates the effectiveness of these novel interventions and investigates the potential for a ""generalization gap"" when compared to conventional treatments for post-stroke aphasia rehabilitation. <b>Methods:</b> Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials (2010-2024) from six databases. We included studies examining AI-powered digital platforms for adults with chronic post-stroke apha-sia that reported standardized language outcomes. <b>Results:</b> Our analysis of five trials (<i>n</i> = 366) shows that AI-assisted therapies successfully deliver high-dose interventions, leading to significant improvements in trained language skills, including word retrieval (up to 16.4% gain) and auditory comprehension. However, a critical ""generalization gap"" was consistently identified: these impairment-level gains rarely transferred to functional, real-world communication. <b>Conclusions:</b> AI-assisted digital therapies effectively solve the dosage problem in aphasia care and improve specific linguistic deficits. Their primary limitation is the failure to generalize skills to everyday use. Future platforms must therefore be strategically redesigned to incorporate therapeutic principles that explicitly target the transfer of skills, bridging the gap between clinical improvement and functional communication.",Liscano Y; Bernal LM; Díaz Vallejo JA,Brain sciences,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41008367/,1,0,0,0,0,0

40995177,Nutrition literacy assessment in older adults: a scoping review of measurement tools.,"Nutritional diseases, common among the elderly, are profoundly affected by nutrition literacy. Nutrition literacy influences dietary habits and behaviors; therefore, developing nutrition literacy is essential for alleviating various illnesses and enhancing quality of life. This study sought to perform a scoping review to find and compare techniques for assessing nutrition literacy in older persons and identify any gaps in this area of scholarship. A comprehensive search of seven internet databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, Wanfang, China Biology Medicine disc (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals (VIP), resulting in 1,995 articles. In addition, additional relevant studies were retrieved from the identified articles' references. Ultimately, 14 publications were included, encompassing a total of 12 nutrition literacy evaluation instruments. The Simplified Nutrition Appetite Questionnaire (SNAQ), and Nutrition Literacy Assessment Tool (NLAT) were identified as unidimensional instruments, while the other tools had multidimensional attributes. Of the 11 instruments assessed for reliability, the Portuguese version of the Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA Portuguese Version) was validated exclusively for validity, lacking a reliability evaluation. Moreover, the NLAT underwent just reliability testing, with no validity assessment performed. We observed that current assessment tools have shortcomings in terms of cultural appropriateness and need further validation. Most current techniques primarily focus on fundamental nutritional knowledge, overall nutritional status, and dietary choices, providing wide-ranging applicability. However, the existing assessment tools exhibit limitations regarding their applicability, indicator systems, and assessment content for elderly patients with chronic diseases, inadequately addressing the specific issues associated with these conditions. To address clinical nutritional requirements, it is essential to enhance the cross-cultural validation of tools via multidisciplinary translation teams and adherence to international guidelines, thereby improving their applicability across diverse populations. There is an immediate necessity to develop adaptable and customizable assessment instruments for certain diseases in the senior population. These tools should incorporate indicators of nutritional knowledge relevant to particular diseases, along with dynamic monitoring indicators of nutritional status, to enhance personalized nutritional management support for elderly. The integration of artificial intelligence technology into these tools can enhance their optimization, leading to improved accuracy and effectiveness in clinical nutritional practices for elderly care.",Ren Y; Liu Y; Liu K; Jin R,Frontiers in nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40995177/,0,1,0,0,0,0

Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in addressing these challenges, enabling breakthroughs from microbial engineering to individualized dietary solutions. This review synthesizes advances in AI-driven precision fermentation-where CRISPR-based microbial optimization and reinforcement learning accelerate bioactive compound synthesis-and hyper-personalized nutrition, where predictive modeling tailors diets to genetic, metabolic, and cultural profiles. We highlight how AI decodes sensory attributes (e.g., flavor and texture) through deep learning and natural language processing, bridging gaps between lab-scale innovation and consumer acceptance. However, the adoption of these technologies raises critical ethical concerns, including data privacy risks from wearable health monitors and algorithmic biases exacerbating nutritional disparities. Key findings include 300% yield increases for alt-proteins via AI-CRISPR fusion, 60% reduction in bioreactor failures through RL optimization, and 25% lower childhood anemia rates via equitable AI-nutrition platforms-though ethical gaps persist in data privacy (72% GDPR non-compliance) and algorithmic bias. By analyzing regulatory frameworks and proposing equity-focused design principles, this article advocates for a balanced approach to AI deployment in food systems.

40973020,Gut Microbiota and Nutrition in Nursing Homes: Challenges and Translational Approaches for Healthy Aging.,"The growing aging population is leading to an increase in demand for long-term care. This is particularly true in nursing homes, where residents are exposed to various challenges such as immunosenescence, frailty, multimorbidity, and dietary and environmental constraints. These interrelated factors contribute to gut microbiota alterations, underscoring the need for tailored strategies to preserve health and resilience in a long-term care setting. Despite its recognized relevance in healthy aging, the gut microbiome of institutionalized elderly remains markedly understudied. This review provides a comprehensive report of the current evidence on the interplay between diet, gut microbiota, and aging among nursing-home residents. The available literature suggests that both aging and institutional living contribute to a less favorable microbiome profile, and several contributing factors, many of them dietary, have been identified. Altered gastrointestinal physiology, malnutrition, and other common conditions in residential care, such as functional or cognitive impairments, frequently lead to changes in food intake that affect the gut ecosystem. Decline in immune system, increased infection risk, sarcopenia, cognitive deterioration, and high medication burden have also been linked to microbiota disruptions in this population. Importantly, adjusting several modifiable features of institutional care, particularly those related to diet and lifestyle, may help counteract these effects by supporting gut health. We further examine how appropriate nutritional strategies can positively influence gut microbiota composition and function, offering a pathway to promote resilience and functionality even in the presence of geriatric syndromes. In addition to identifying these challenges, this review outlines feasible, microbiota-informed strategies to improve quality of life and health outcomes. These include individualized dietary adaptations, targeted supplementation, physical activity interventions, and the integration of digital and artificial intelligence tools to support personalized nutrition. Finally, we highlight the need for standardized protocols and implementation science frameworks to enhance clinical translation, thereby advancing an integrative and as yet underrepresented perspective on microbiota-based strategies to promote healthier aging trajectories in institutionalized elderly.",Jiménez-Arroyo C; Molinero N; Moreno-Arribas MV,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40973020/,1,0,0,0,0,0

40930112,How big data analytics can strengthen large-scale food fortification and biofortification decision-making: A scoping review.,"Big data analytics have shown great potential to improve decision-making in health, including disease surveillance and healthcare delivery. This scoping review explores how big data supports decision-making in large-scale food fortification (LSFF) and biofortification across the food value chain. Following PRISMA guidelines, we analyzed open-access peer-reviewed literature and gray literature from 2012 to 2022. Given the limited literature, we broadened our search to include big data applications in agriculture and nutrition, aiming to draw relevant insights for LSFF and biofortification. Of 1678 records, 28 mentioned LSFF or biofortification, all published between 2018 and 2022. Overall, most records focused on production (60%) and inputs (19.5%). Notably, 16.7% (n = 7) of records mentioning LSFF or biofortification addressed public health monitoring, compared to 2.3% (n = 45) of those without a mention. Use case examples include blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) for fortified product traceability, machine learning to predict fortification gaps, and artificial intelligence to analyze anemia prevalence, highlighting opportunities to enhance both production and public health monitoring. Despite this potential, big data use in LSFF and biofortification remains limited. Expanding its use in underexplored areas, such as distribution and regulation, could enhance decision-making, efficiency, and sustainability in LSFF and biofortification.",Walsh F; Zhenchuk A; Luthringer C; Kratz C; Schweigert F,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40930112/,0,0,0,0,0,0

An appraisal from the EASD Global Council.,"This review article, developed by the EASD Global Council, addresses the growing global challenges in diabetes research and care, highlighting the rising prevalence of diabetes, the increasing complexity of its management and the need for a coordinated international response. With regard to research, disparities in funding and infrastructure between high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are discussed. The under-representation of LMIC populations in clinical trials, challenges in conducting large-scale research projects, and the ethical and legal complexities of artificial intelligence integration are also considered as specific issues. The development of global research networks and strategies for improved training, standardisation of data and enhanced accessibility to big data analytics to drive innovation and personalised medicine are recommended. With regard to diabetes care, inequalities in access to essential medications, particularly insulin and novel therapies, and disparities in healthcare infrastructure are discussed. Proposed initiatives include international support programmes, improved healthcare provider training and the inclusion of newer diabetes medications in essential drug lists. The importance of global screening programmes, a universal diabetes education curriculum and standardised healthcare checklists is also emphasised. Regarding healthcare organisation, the development of national diabetes registers, benchmarking performance across regions and strengthening international collaborations are highly advised. The role of diabetes specialists as care coordinators and the need for structured assessments to improve early intervention and long-term outcomes are also discussed.

Although most of the growth is in primary care, APPs are becoming increasingly leveraged in subspecialty care, including allergy and immunology (A&I). At present, there is limited literature on APPs in A&I specifically, but there is growing literature on APP utilization and training in other specialties. Structured transition-to-practice programs (including onboarding programs and formal residency/fellowships) for APPs in other specialties are increasingly common and are associated with improved clinical productivity, practice autonomy, expertise, confidence, and decreased turnover. It would benefit A&I to adopt a similar approach, as at present, the training and educational experiences APPs receive in A&I are quite varied. This article will review the training/certification of APPs, lessons learned from other specialties, what is known about the role of APPs in A&I, and next steps for the future.",Bauer M; Leeds S; Lewis MO; Crain M; Michaud A; Verdi M; de Guzman N; Shaker M; Nowak-Wegrzyn A,"Annals of allergy, asthma & immunology : official publication of the American College of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40921401/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40917764,Provider Attitudes and Perceptions on Using Artificial Intelligence in Colonoscopy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Colonoscopy is the gold standard screening modality for colorectal cancer; however, it is operator-dependent and reliant on exam quality. Incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into colonoscopy may improve adenoma detection and clinical outcomes, but this is a sociotechnical challenge that requires effective human-AI teaming incorporating provider attitudes. We conducted a systematic review of studies evaluating attitudes and perspectives of providers toward AI-assisted colonoscopy. Participant responses to outcome questions of interest were combined across the studies to calculate pooled proportion (Pp) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Top-ranked perceived advantages and disadvantages in each study were defined as the items that >50% of the study participants voted for. Out of 2044 abstracts screened, 13 studies were included representing 1538 providers who were mostly gastroenterologists or trainees and 25%-100% had direct experience using AI in a clinical setting. Overall, a large majority were interested in using AI (Pp = 80%, 95% CI 70%-89%, n = 8 studies) and believed it can improve adenoma or polyp detection rate (Pp = 74%, 95% CI 68%-80%, n = 4 studies). Among 5 studies addressing financial implications, about half were concerned about the cost of using AI (52%, 95% CI 24%-79%). An average of 38% of respondents (95% CI 9%-73%) from 4 studies raised concern regarding accountability for misdiagnosis. High number of false positives and an absence of clinical guidelines were top-ranked perceived disadvantages in 2 studies. Most gastroenterology providers expressed interest in using AI systems with colonoscopy and believed it can improve adenoma detection rate. Cost, high number of false positives, and lack of professional society guidelines were among top perceived concerns.",Soleymanjahi S; Rajashekar N; Chung S; Grimshaw AA; Tvedt MJK; Foroutan F; Sultan S; Shung DL; Kolb JM,Gastro hep advances,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40917764/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies assessing the accuracy of DHEA-S in diagnosing MACS or AI. From inception to January 8, 2024, we searched databases for original studies of at least 20 participants with MACS or AI. MACS was defined as postdexamethasone cortisol greater than 1.8 mcg/dL or postsurgical hypocortisolism. AI was defined by abnormal dynamic testing. QUADAS-2 was used to assess the risk of bias. Bivariate random effects meta-analysis was used to generate pooled diagnostic accuracy estimates. Seven studies on DHEA-S accuracy in diagnosing MACS (574 patients with MACS, 830 referent individuals), and 2 studies on DHEA-S accuracy in diagnosing AI (52 patients with AI, 59 referent individuals) were included. A meta-analysis of studies using DHEA-S cutoff between 60 and 70 mcg/dL to diagnose MACS demonstrated a sensitivity of 82% (95% CI, 64%-93%) and a specificity of 82% (95% CI, 74%-88%). In the 2 studies evaluating DHEA-S in diagnosing AI, the reference standard was a 1-mcg cosyntropin stimulation test. The sensitivity of DHEA-S for diagnosing AI ranged from 70.3% to 86.7%, and the specificity was 87.1%. Most studies were at a moderate risk of bias. Based on limited heterogeneous evidence, measurement of DHEA-S provides additional value in diagnosing MACS, as well as AI.",Saini J; Salama B; Yu K; Chacko SR; Han AJ; Villavicencio Torres C; Murad MH; Bancos I,Journal of the Endocrine Society,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40909019/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40907752,Perspective: Food Is Medicine: Hype or Hope?,"Food is medicine (FIM) initiatives are food-based nutrition interventions to prevent or manage chronic disease and improve overall health. It is increasingly embraced across healthcare systems, policymakers, and researchers as a promising strategy to address diet-related chronic diseases. Despite this enthusiasm, questions have been raised about whether FIM is overhyped, given the still limited evidence. FIM incorporates interventions such as medically tailored meals, medically tailored groceries, teaching kitchens (TKs), and food prescriptions. Emerging evidence demonstrates these programs' benefits in improving diet quality such as increased fruit and vegetable consumption and some improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors. Limited evidence also indicated potential healthcare cost savings and reduced hospitalizations associated with FIM interventions. Recent advances in FIM include increased medical nutrition education for physicians, precision nutrition approaches, and the use of artificial intelligence in nutritional assessments and personalized meal planning. In addition, community-based programs have integrated culturally relevant foods, whereas culinary medicine and TKs provide more hands-on nutrition education, aimed to improve culinary skills, and promote behavioral changes. Historical and cultural dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean and Asian diets, can be incorporated into contemporary FIM strategies. FIM, however, faces many challenges such as the potential overmedicalization of food, limitations in current evidence (e.g., small sample sizes and short follow-up), logistical and operational barriers, and issues of access and equity among underserved populations. Future research needs include larger, long-term trials and real-world evidence from natural experiments, more rigorous economic evaluations, and the evaluations of digital health applications. Aligning FIM with broader public health goals and fostering interdisciplinary partnerships are crucial for its sustained impact and greater integration into healthcare systems.",Glenn AJ; Hu FB,The Journal of nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40907752/,1,0,0,0,0,1

40895842,"A holistic review of buffalo productivity, reproductive efficiency, genetic improvement, and disease management in Bangladesh.","Buffaloes play a vital role in Bangladesh's livestock sector, contributing significantly to the nation's milk and meat production. However, their productivity remains below potential due to limited genetic capacity, poor reproductive performance, and inadequate health and management practices. This review critically synthesizes findings from scientific literature, field studies, and national reports to assess the status of buffalo production, reproductive efficiency, genetic improvement efforts, and disease management strategies in Bangladesh. Major challenges include low milk yield (average 2.50-4.00 liters/day), imbalanced nutrition, reliance on traditional feeding systems, and minimal mechanization. Reproductive inefficiencies are characterized by low conception rates (below 40%), prolonged calving intervals (local:19.36 ± 2.39 months; crossbred: 19.37 ± 2.63 months), delayed onset of puberty (30 to 36 months), and ineffective estrus detection. Although crossbreeding programs with high-yielding breeds such as Murrah and Nili-Ravi have been introduced, progress has been limited due to inadequate record-keeping, lack of performance monitoring, and continued dependence on conventional breeding methods. Disease prevention and control are further impeded by insufficient veterinary infrastructure, low vaccination coverage, and limited farmer awareness. Structural barriers such as the absence of integrated development frameworks, restricted access to artificial insemination (AI), and a shortage of superior germplasm also hinder sectoral advancement. To address these multifaceted issues, the review advocates for enhanced farmer education, expansion of AI services, development of region-specific disease control strategies, and the implementation of systematic genetic improvement programs incorporating molecular technologies. Strengthened collaboration among government agencies, research institutions, and farming communities is essential to foster a resilient, productive, and sustainable buffalo industry in Bangladesh.",Pehan EA; Miah M; Rahman MH; Shejuty SF; Haque MN; Huda MN; Habib MR; Ali MY,Veterinary and animal science,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40895842/,1,0,0,0,0,0

40885603,Effect of Epigallocatechin Gallate on Glycemic Index: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a major catechin found in green tea, has been suggested to influence glycemic control. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate the effects of EGCG on the glycemic index (GI) and related glycemic parameters. Using predefined keywords, online databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, and Google Scholar) were searched for relevant studies, published from inception up to May 2024. Initially 1994 studies were obtained out of which 41 RCTs were decided to be included for further analyses. The meta-analysis demonstrated that EGCG supplementation led to statistically significant, but modest, reductions in fasting blood glucose (FBG), HbA1c, and HOMA-IR. Notably, the reduction in HbA1c (WMD: -0.18%, 95% CI: -0.35, -0.02; P = 0.029) was small and may not equate to clinically meaningful benefits for all populations. Furthermore, the effect on fasting insulin was not statistically significant (WMD: -0.50; 95% CI: -1.46, 0.47; P = 0.313), indicating a lack of robust or consistent impact on this parameter across studies. Although EGCG supplementation is associated with improvements in some glycemic parameters, these effects especially for HbA1c and fasting insulin are modest and may not be clinically meaningful for most population. Therefore, current evidence does not strongly support the use of EGCG as a stand-alone intervention for glycemic control.",Saadh MJ; Gataa IS; Hussam AS; Kaur I; Kumar A; Godara P; Zainul R; Muzammil K; Zahrani Y,Clinical therapeutics,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40885603/,0,1,0,1,0,0
40882716,"Multigene engineering in plants: Technologies, applications, and future prospects.","The emerging bioeconomy presents a promising solution to both economic and environmental challenges. Within the bioeconomy, plants serve as a renewable, sustainable, and cost-effective source of foods, fuels, chemicals, and materials. However, traditional breeding and single-gene engineering approaches fall short in addressing complex traits (e.g., drought tolerance, disease resistance, yield, nutrient use efficiency) which are controlled by multiple genes. The complexity of plant biology often necessitates the use of multigene engineering (MGE), which involves simultaneous ectopic expression, up/down-regulation, or editing of multiple genes, to enhance plant traits relevant to the bioeconomy. These genes may be associated with distinct traits or function as components of specific metabolic and regulatory pathways. This review summarizes current technologies for MGE within the synthetic biology-driven Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) framework, detailing its four key stages: Design - gene construct development; Build - DNA assembly and plant transformation; Test - the molecular, biochemical, and physiological characterization of engineered plants; and Learn - computational modeling to refine, multiplex and iterate the process. Despite good progress in the applications of MGE in biofortification, metabolic engineering, and stress resilience, challenges remain in construct stability, coordinated gene expression, and regulatory predictability. We identified optimization paths and future directions to accelerate MGE deployment in sustainable agriculture, with possible societal benefits including reduced production costs, increased yield, and improved food and nutritional security.",Rajput R; Boone BA; Mandlik R; Islam MT; Qi Y; Wang J; Barrangou R; Sozzani R; Eckert CA; Tuskan GA; Chen JG; Yang X,Biotechnology advances,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40882716/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Although this is challenging, recent conceptual and technological advances in functional genomics, coupled with computational biology, high-throughput plant phenotyping and artificial intelligence, are now aiding our uncovering of the molecular mechanisms underlying plant stress tolerance. Integrating other innovative approaches such as genome editing, modern plant breeding and synthetic biology facilitates the development of climate-smart cereal crops. Here, we discuss major recent advances in plant functional genomic approaches and techniques such as third-generation sequencing, transcriptomics, pangenomes, genome-wide association studies and epigenomics, which have advanced our understanding of the molecular basis of stress tolerance and development of stress-resilient cereals. Further, we highlight how these genomics approaches are successfully integrated into new plant breeding methods for effective development of stress-tolerant crops.

Drawing insights from 122 peer-reviewed studies spanning 2010-2025, this systematic review reveals how DT architectures for dairy cattle are conceptualized, validated, and deployed. We introduce a novel five-dimensional classification framework-spanning application domain, modeling paradigms, computational topology, validation protocols, and implementation maturity-to provide a coherent comparative lens across diverse DT implementations. Hybrid edge-cloud architectures emerge as optimal solutions, with lightweight CNN-LSTM models embedded in collar or rumen-bolus microcontrollers achieving over 90% accuracy in recognizing feeding and rumination behaviors. Simultaneously, remote cloud systems harness mechanistic fermentation simulations and multi-objective genetic algorithms to optimize feed composition, minimize greenhouse gas emissions, and balance amino acid nutrition. Field-tested prototypes indicate significant agronomic benefits, including 15-20% enhancements in feed conversion efficiency and water use reductions of up to 40%. Nevertheless, critical challenges remain: effectively fusing heterogeneous sensor data amid high barn noise, ensuring millisecond-level synchronization across unreliable rural networks, and rigorously verifying AI-generated nutritional recommendations across varying genotypes, lactation phases, and climates. Overcoming these gaps necessitates integrating explainable AI with biologically grounded digestion models, federated learning protocols for data privacy, and standardized PRISMA-based validation approaches. The distilled implementation roadmap offers actionable guidelines for sensor selection, middleware integration, and model lifecycle management, enabling proactive rather than reactive dairy management-an essential leap toward climate-smart, welfare-oriented, and economically resilient dairy farming.",Rao S; Neethirajan S,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40871763/,0,1,0,0,0,0
40871725,Integrating Precision Medicine and Digital Health in Personalized Weight Management: The Central Role of Nutrition.,"Obesity is a global health challenge marked by substantial inter-individual differences in responses to dietary and lifestyle interventions. Traditional weight loss strategies often overlook critical biological variations in genetics, metabolic profiles, and gut microbiota composition, contributing to poor adherence and variable outcomes. Our primary aim is to identify key biological and behavioral effectors relevant to precision medicine for weight control, with a particular focus on nutrition, while also discussing their current and potential integration into digital health platforms. Thus, this review aligns more closely with the identification of influential factors within precision medicine (e.g., genetic, metabolic, and microbiome factors) but also explores how these factors are currently integrated into digital health tools. We synthesize recent advances in nutrigenomics, nutritional metabolomics, and microbiome-informed nutrition, highlighting how tailored dietary strategies-such as high-protein, low-glycemic, polyphenol-enriched, and fiber-based diets-can be aligned with specific genetic variants (e.g., FTO and MC4R), metabolic phenotypes (e.g., insulin resistance), and gut microbiota profiles (e.g., <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> abundance, SCFA production). In parallel, digital health tools-including mobile health applications, wearable devices, and AI-supported platforms-enhance self-monitoring, adherence, and dynamic feedback in real-world settings. Mechanistic pathways such as gut-brain axis regulation, microbial fermentation, gene-diet interactions, and anti-inflammatory responses are explored to explain inter-individual differences in dietary outcomes. However, challenges such as cost, accessibility, and patient motivation remain and should be addressed to ensure the effective implementation of these integrated strategies in real-world settings. Collectively, these insights underscore the pivotal role of precision nutrition as a cornerstone for personalized, scalable, and sustainable obesity interventions.",Liu X; Xu M; Wang H; Zhu L,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40871725/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Recent findings on enzymatic and microbial metabolism are discussed, along with results from interventions involving whole vegetables, sprouts, and extracts. Although promising effects on blood pressure, lipid profiles, and glycaemic control have been observed, clinical studies are often limited by small sample sizes, study heterogeneity, and high inter-individual variability, particularly related to gut microbiota and host metabolic phenotype. Challenges like inconsistent biomarkers, formulation variability, and tolerability issues complicate data interpretation. To realise their full potential, larger, standardised, microbiome-informed trials with validated biomarkers and optimised delivery are needed to clarify host-compound-microbiome interactions and support evidence-based disease prevention strategies.",Narra F; Galgani G; Harris CB; Moreno DA; Núñez-Gómez V,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40870788/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40877640,Early and long-term effects of maternal protein restriction on offspring organs and systems: insights from the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD).,"Maternal malnutrition affects millions of people worldwide in two main ways: through food insecurity and hunger, as well as through diets high in ultra-processed, low-nutrient foods. These effects are often linked to deficiencies in specific macronutrients and micronutrients, which can lead to organ-specific consequences in the biological development of the child-a context explored within the framework of the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD). Given the extensive effects of maternal protein restriction (MPR) on offspring development, this review focuses specifically on low-protein diets and their impact on various organs and systems. It compiles both experimental and epidemiological data across different developmental stages. Poor maternal nutrition can impair embryonic and fetal development, creating a stressful microenvironment for both mother and child from the earliest stages of life. This stress can leave epigenetic marks that influence health and disease outcomes later in life. Numerous studies have documented the wide-ranging consequences of malnutrition, highlighting its detrimental effects on metabolic, molecular, and phenotypic systems. This narrative review aims to present both the immediate and long-term effects of exposure to MPR throughout the lifespan of the offspring.",Fioretto MN; Barata LA; Ribeiro IT; Maciel FA; Mattos R; de Souza PV; Portela LMF; Dos Santos SAA; Scarano WR; Justulin LA,Biogerontology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40877640/,1,0,0,0,0,0

40863208,Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) in Gastric Cancer: Current Applications and Future Perspectives.,"Gastric cancer remains the fourth leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Advanced disease is associated with a poor prognosis, emphasizing the critical importance of early diagnosis through endoscopy. In addition to prognosis, disease extent also plays a pivotal role in guiding management strategies. Therefore, accurate locoregional staging (T and N staging) is vital for optimal prognostic and therapeutic planning. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has long been an essential tool in this regard, with computed tomography (CT) and, more recently, positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) serving as alternative imaging modalities. EUS is particularly valuable in the assessment of early gastric cancer, defined as tumor invasion confined to the mucosa or submucosa. These tumors are increasingly managed by endoscopic resection techniques offering improved post-treatment quality of life. EUS has also recently been utilized in the restaging process after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, aiding in the evaluation of tumor resectability and prognosis. Its performance may be further enhanced through the application of emerging techniques such as contrast-enhanced endosonography, EUS elastography, and artificial intelligence systems. In advanced, unresectable disease, complications such as gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) severely impact patient quality of life. In this setting, EUS-guided gastroenterostomy (EUS-GE) offers a less invasive alternative to surgical gastrojejunostomy. This review summarizes and critically analyzes the role of EUS in the context of gastric cancer, highlighting its applications across different stages of the disease and evaluating its performance relative to other diagnostic modalities.",Ziogas DI; Kalakos N; Manolakis A; Voulgaris T; Vezakis I; Tadic M; Papanikolaou IS,"Diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40863208/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Recent advancements in gut microbiota (GM) research have shed light on the intricate relationship between GM and TB, suggesting that GM alterations may influence host susceptibility, disease progression, and response to antituberculosis drugs. This review systematically synthesizes and analyzes the current research progress on the relationship between GM and TB, focusing on six key aspects: (1) bidirectional effects between GM dynamics and TB progression; (2) the interaction between GM and anti-TB drugs; (3) GM and TB immune response; (4) GM as a potential target for diagnosis and treatment of TB; (5) multi-omics and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in GM-TB research; (6) current challenges and future directions in GM-TB research. We highlight the bidirectional nature of the GM-TB interaction, where MTB infection can lead to GM dysbiosis, and changes can affect the host's immune response, contributing to TB onset and progression. Advanced molecular techniques, such as next-generation sequencing and metagenomics, along with AI, play pivotal roles in elucidating these complex interactions. Future research directions include investigating the relationship between GM and TB vaccine efficacy, exploring GM's potential in TB prevention, developing microbiome-based diagnostic and prognostic tools, and examining the role of GM in TB recurrence. By addressing these areas, we aim to provide a comprehensive perspective on the latest advancements in GM and TB research and offer insights for future studies and clinical applications. Ultimately, the development of novel microbiome-based strategies may offer new tools and insights for the effective control and management of TB, a disease that continues to pose a significant threat to public health.",Liu Y; Yang L; Meskini M; Goel A; Opperman M; Shyamal SS; Manaithiya A; Xiao M; Ni R; An Y; Zhang M; Tian Y; Zhou S; Ye Z; Zhuang L; Li L; Saraswat I; Kar A; Ali SL; Ullah S; Ali SY; Kaushik S; Tian T; Jiao M; Wang S; Ghisleni G; Armanni A; Fumagalli S; Wang W; Cao C; Carpena M; Prieto MA; Bruno A; Jin C; Hu H; Zhang Y; du Preez I; Aspatwar A; Zhang L; Gong W,iMeta,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40860431/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40856763,Ubiquitous presence of microplastics with implication on soil health and plant development.,"Plastic has become ubiquitous, as it is present in soil, air, fresh, and marine water environments. Microplastic (MPs) pollution has dramatically increased and is found in a range of terrestrial ecosystems, including Arctic and Antarctic. With their tenacity, adaptability, and long-lasting perseverance within the environment, MPs are pervasive and pose a worldwide environmental risk. Their environmental implications are profound and multifaceted. Agroplastics are the common source of plastics found on land. Their abundance in agricultural soils is greater than in urban soils, due to the frequent use of plasticulture. MPs can indirectly or directly have an impact on the functioning of ecosystems and soil-plant health. MPs can change the physicochemical properties of soil, which further affects soil microbial functions and the growth of plants. The interference of MPs can cascade via soil ecosystems and impact production by altering the overall health of the soil, root interactions, and the cycling of nutrients. MPs' presence in agricultural produce clearly suggests their movement into the food chain, predicting danger to human health. A proper understanding of the chemical nature of different types of MPs and collaborative government ventures can offer a possible solution to this global concern. Therefore, the present article highlights the nature and distribution of microplastics in the environment. It also provides insights about the fate of microplastics in soil and plant bodies and their toxicological impact, along with possible remediation strategies.",Manhas S; Anjali A; Malviya T; Gupta P; Sharma T; Kumari M; Sharma V; Nabi Z; Arya VM; Rattan P; Popescu SM; Sharma V,Environmental monitoring and assessment,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40856763/,1,0,0,0,0,0

40850705,Food fermentations: NIR spectroscopy as a tool for process analytical technology.,"Fermentation is a cornerstone of the food system, offering several benefits in nutrition, food safety, sustainability, and sensory quality. Historically rooted in food preservation and cultural practices, fermentation has evolved into a dynamic biotechnological tool, spanning diverse applications from dairy, meat, vegetable, and plant-based foods to by-product valorization. The process leverages microbial metabolisms (primarily lactic acid bacteria, yeasts, and molds) to enhance shelf life and sensory properties, improve digestibility, and generate bioactive compounds. Advances in precision fermentation and strain engineering have further extended fermentation potential to address emerging food challenges. Traditional fermentation monitoring relies on manual, off-line techniques that lack real-time responsiveness. The integration of advanced sensor technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), and process analytical technology (PAT) enables real-time, non-invasive process control. Among these tools, near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy stands out due to its speed, low cost, minimal sample preparation, and compatibility with multivariate data analysis. NIR spectroscopy, combined with machine learning models, has demonstrated robust performance in predicting fermentation parameters across multiple food matrices, including alcoholic beverages, dairy, plant and meat fermented products, bread, kombucha, and vinegar. However, challenges such as spectral complexity, calibration transferability, and model interpretability persist. Future perspectives emphasize the convergence of NIR spectroscopy with digital twins, hybrid modeling, and explainable AI, enabling self-optimizing, adaptive fermentation systems. Emerging NIR devices offer portability and scalability, democratizing access to smart fermentation control for both industrial and artisanal producers.

To address the current silos embedded in climate, environmental, and public health monitoring and surveillance systems, climate-smart public health (CSPH) creates an integrated platform for action across these sectors, enabling more rapid and efficient responses to climate-related public health challenges. In this Personal View, we introduce the concept of CSPH, a data-driven framework designed to monitor, assess, and adapt to climate-related health impacts. CSPH incorporates surveillance, risk assessment, early warning systems, and resilient health-care infrastructure to address the evolving challenges of climate change. The framework adopts an iterative, community-centred model that responds to local needs and incorporates feedback from health-care providers and policy makers. CSPH also leverages data science and artificial intelligence to address a wide range of health concerns, including infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, nutrition, and mental health. We applied this framework in Madagascar, a region highly vulnerable to climate impacts, where poverty, malnutrition, and frequent extreme weather events make climate adaptation particularly urgent. Early data analysis has shown strong climate sensitivity in important diseases such as malaria and diarrhoea, which could enable preparedness efforts to target some regions more efficiently. CSPH provides a pathway to enhance resilience in such settings by improving the capacity of public health systems to withstand and respond to climate-related stressors.",Golden CD; Childs ML; Mudele OE; Andriamizarasoa FA; Bouley TA; De Nicola G; Fontaine MA; Huybers PJ; Mahatante PT; Rabemananjara R; Rakotoarison N; Ramambason HR; Ramihantaniarivo H; Randriamady HJ; Randriatsara H; Ravelomanantsoa MA; Razafinimanana AKS; Rigden AJ; Shumake-Guillemot J; Yasmine LL; Dominici F,The Lancet.

The effect of a single abiotic (salinity, micronutrients, and conductive material) or biotic factor (bacteria, fungi, and archaea) on AD has been reviewed previously. However, the recent research trend on combined factors strategies (CFSs) (abiotic with biotic or two abiotic or biotic) in AD has not been reviewed. Thus, this review aims to collect, summarize, and compare the recent studies on CFSs in AD. The impact of CFSs on substrate digestion, biomethanation, microbial abundance, enzyme production, and metabolic pathways is elaborated. The time (initial, middle, and end) of CFSs addition, artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, and technoeconomic analysis are also discussed. Biochar + micronutrients were the most studied coupled abiotic factors, followed by magnetite + activated carbon, which are reported to improve the hydrolysis efficiency, biomethane production, and microbial abundance. Combined biotic factors (bacteria + archaea) improved key methanogens (Methanothrix and Methanosarcina). The majorly reported integrated abiotic and biotic factors were biochar + archaea, which promoted microbial growth and direct inter-species electron transport, resulting in increased biomethane production (14.4-79 %).

IBD is also a risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC), which remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortalities worldwide. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a diverse family of proteases that play critical roles in both intestinal homeostasis and disease pathogenesis. Produced by epithelial, stromal, and immune cells, MMPs can regulate stem cell function, immune cell recruitment, microbial composition, barrier integrity, angiogenesis, and cell proliferation through extracellular matrix remodeling, cytokine activation, or direct interactions with target cells, thereby impacting the progression of both IBD and CRC. In this review we discuss the roles of MMPs in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and their contributions to imbalanced immune responses, epithelial integrity, and wound healing in IBD. Additionally, we highlight their contribution to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and metastasis in CRC. Finally, we review the potential utilization of MMPs as biomarkers for IBD/CRC diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response. MMPs remain central to both IBD and CRC biology and present both challenges and opportunities for therapeutic intervention and disease monitoring.",Manzanares LD; Herrnreiter CJ; Hirst J; Sumagin R,Journal of leukocyte biology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40796163/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40792566,"Combating saffron fraud: a systematic review of adulteration practices, detection technologies, recommendations and challenges.","Saffron, the world's most valuable spice, faces pervasive threats from food fraud, compromising its authenticity, economic value, and consumer safety. This systematic review synthesizes evidence from 23 studies to evaluate the prevalence, methods, impacts, and detection strategies of saffron adulteration. Following PRISMA guidelines, peer-reviewed articles from PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect (2015-2025) were analyzed. Findings reveal that 20-30% of commercial saffron is adulterated globally, though with significant regional disparities (e.g., 3.5% in regulated EU markets vs. 60% in India), driven by economic incentives and regulatory gaps. Common fraudulent practices include substitution with safflower, marigold, or turmeric; dilution with extraneous plant materials; and the addition of hazardous synthetic dyes such as Sudan compounds and auramine-O. Advanced detection technologies including DNA barcoding, spectroscopy, hyperspectral imaging, and machine learning demonstrate high accuracy but face barriers in cost, accessibility, and real-world applicability. Health risks, such as exposure to carcinogenic dyes, and economic losses for legitimate producers underscore the urgency of addressing supply chain vulnerabilities. The review highlights fragmented regulatory frameworks and emphasizes the need for harmonized ISO standards, blockchain-enabled traceability, and consumer education to combat fraud. Emerging portable tools, such as smartphone-based spectroscopy and AI-driven platforms, offer promising solutions for on-site authentication.",Mehdizadeh M; Omidi A; Morya S; Abideen Z,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40792566/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40790089,Parathyroid hormone receptor agonists in the management of osteoporosis.,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) regulates bone homeostasis. Intermittent exposure to PTH results in bone formation being greater than bone resorption, and this effect has been harnessed through the development of agonists of the PTH and PTH-related protein type 1 receptor (PTH1R) to treat osteoporosis. Teriparatide, an analogue of the first 34 amino acids of PTH, and abaloparatide, which resembles PTH-related protein (PTHrP) in structure, are PTH1R agonists currently in clinical use. Both medications have been shown to increase bone mineral density at the lumbar spine, femoral neck and total hip. Randomized controlled trials with teriparatide or abaloparatide have also provided evidence of reduction in vertebral and non-vertebral fractures. The ACTIVE trial suggested slightly greater efficacy for major osteoporotic fractures (as an exploratory end point) for abaloparatide than for teriparatide. A similar potential superiority was suggested for hip fracture in a real-world, observational study. Side effects of these medications are usually transient, and although a risk of osteosarcoma was suggested by studies using murine models, no such risk has been observed in extensive human studies. Overall, both teriparatide and abaloparatide have demonstrated convincing clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, with a reassuring safety profile. Potential differences in their effects on bone mineral density and their antifracture effects offer avenues for differentiation but require further validation in appropriately designed studies.",Fuggle N; Rizzoli R; Beaudart C; Cortet B; Curtis EM; Hiligsmann M; Kaufman JM; Veronese N; Albergaria BH; Al-Daghri N; Alokail M; Brandi ML; Bruyère O; Burlet N; Campusano C; Casado E; Cavalier E; Chandran M; Cooper C; D'Amelio P; Dawson-Hughes B; Ebeling PR; Kanis JA; Kurth A; Matijevic R; McCloskey E; McClung M; Mkinsi O; Njeze N; Radermecker RP; Rannou F; Silverman S; Tüzün Ş; Zakraoui L; Reginster JY; Harvey NC,Nature reviews.

This review summarized the technical advantages of SIL-TEP in reducing postoperative pain, accelerating functional recovery and improving cosmetic results compared with traditional three-port TEP. The perioperative strategies under eras concept were further discussed, including preoperative nutrition optimization, laryngeal mask airway (LMA) use, early oral feeding, multimodal analgesia and timely removal of urinary catheter. SIL-TEP combined with ERAS had significant clinical benefits, including decreased pain score at 24 h after operation, shortened recovery time of daily activities, and improved patient satisfaction with incision appearance. ERAS interventions have resulted in reduced length of hospital stay; however, there are still technical limitations, including difficulties in device triangulation and learning curve requirements for the number of medical records. The collaborative application of SIL-TEP and ERAS represents a paradigm shift in minimally invasive hernia management, achieving enhanced recovery metrics and cost-effectiveness.

40759632,Hallmarks and mechanisms of cellular senescence in aging and disease.,"Cellular senescence, often referred to simply as ""senescence"", is a complex intracellular process with diverse biological, physiological, and pathological roles. Biologically, it is essential for embryogenesis and development. Physiologically, senescence acts as a safeguard against tumorigenesis by preventing the proliferation of damaged or defective cells. However, persistent activation of senescence can contribute to various pathological conditions, particularly those associated with aging, cancer, and other chronic diseases such as liver and pulmonary diseases. Growing evidence links aging to heightened activation of cellular senescence, leading to the accumulation of senescent cells. Here in this perspective, we aim to decipher the latest molecular mechanisms and regulatory pathways of cellular senescence in the context of aging and aging-related diseases. Additionally, we discuss emerging research directions, highlighting current limitations and gaps in the field.

40754211,The Application of Machine Learning in the Analysis of Macro and Micro-Nutrients of Human Milk: a Scoping Review.,"Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning, has significantly advanced the analysis of complex biological systems, including human milk-a vital source of nutrition for infant growth and development. Despite advancements, the application of machine learning for detailed nutritional profiling of human milk remains limited. This review systematically examines and synthesizes the existing literature on the application of machine learning to analyze and predict the macro- and micronutrient content of human milk. Following the Joanna Briggs Institute Methods Manual, a systematic search was conducted in November 2024 across 4 sources: MEDLINE (via PubMed), CINAHL, Scopus, and the ACM Digital Library. Eligible studies applied machine learning techniques to analyze and predict the composition of human milk. Five studies published between 2021 and 2024 were included, employing cross-sectional (n = 4) and cohort (n = 1) designs. Sample sizes ranged from 6 to >1000 breast milk samples, collected through pumping, hand expression, or milk bank donations. A variety of machine learning algorithms were applied to predict and analyze human milk components. Models demonstrated strong predictive accuracy for macronutrients-particularly fat and protein-which consistently achieved low error rates and high R<sup>2</sup> values. Predictions for lactose and energy were also promising, though somewhat less consistent across methods. Only one study addressed micronutrient prediction, yielding moderate results and highlighting a critical gap in the literature. Machine learning holds strong potential for advancing human milk research by improving nutrient composition analysis and uncovering associations with maternal and environmental factors. However, existing studies remain limited, particularly in the areas of micronutrient analysis and laboratory-based nutrient profiling.

40751946,Possibilities and limitations of artificial intelligence in food-derived peptides.,"The deep integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with research on food-derived peptides (FDPs) signifies a paradigm shift towards intelligent precision design and functional optimization in developing FDP products. Random forests, convolutional neural networks and other machine learning and deep learning technologies have markedly expedited bioactive peptide discovery, functional characterization and structure-activity relationship elucidation, while their comprehensive application confronts critical challenges encompassing dataset integrity, model architecture optimization, interpretability constraints and experimental verification requirements. Consequently, a comprehensive understanding of the existing limitations and future opportunities of AI technology in the field of FDPs is required. This review evaluates traditional methodologies and AI applications in FDP research, addressing current limitations and prospects. AI faces several challenges in predicting complex protein structures and FDPs. Dimensionality curse and local optima during protein structure prediction reduce accuracy. In FDP prediction, the selection of amino acid descriptors limits model stability. Additionally, the scarcity of FDP datasets leads to accuracy reduction in AI model training and introduces class distribution bias. Traditional cross-entropy loss further exacerbates class distribution skew. These issues collectively constrain the application of AI in FDP prediction. AI enhances peptide screening efficiency through large-scale data processing, reducing research costs. Standardized multidimensional databases integrated with heterogeneous AI architectures improve predictive model accuracy and cross-domain adaptability.

40751944,Selenium biofortification: integrating one health and sustainability.,"Selenium (Se) biofortification in crops has emerged as a promising strategy to address global Se deficiencies and enhance both agricultural productivity and human health. Increasing the Se content of crops through biofortification improves their resilience to abiotic and biotic stresses and boosts their nutritional value. This benefits human health by protecting against diseases such as cancer, infections and allergies when the crops are consumed. Furthermore, Se-biofortified non-edible plant parts have significant potential in biomedicine and could enhance the value of agricultural byproducts. This strategy contributes to a circular economy by reducing waste, improving resource efficiency and providing sustainable alternatives to synthetic pharmaceuticals and supplements. Ultimately, it supports environmental and economic sustainability. Nevertheless, Se biofortification faces several challenges, particularly with regard to standardization, acceptance by consumers and farmers, and the regulatory and economic frameworks that govern its implementation. Effectively addressing these issues is crucial to unlocking the full potential of Se biofortification. This could significantly improve global nutritional outcomes, reduce the prevalence of Se deficiency-related health conditions, support the prevention and treatment of diseases and promote sustainable agricultural practices that align with long-term food security goals. In this context, future perspectives highlight the promising integration of biofortified residues generated by Se biofortification with emerging technologies such as biorefineries and artificial intelligence.

As global population growth exacerbates issues such as climate change, food security, and resource depletion, innovative solutions are needed. Similarly, confined and isolated environments on Earth and in space lack essential life-supporting resources such as oxygen, water, and food. Combined with the challenges of microgravity and radiation exposure, these factors present substantial obstacles to advancing human space exploration. Biotechnological innovations are essential to enable long-term habitation in extraterrestrial environments. Microalgae, with their high photosynthetic efficiency, diverse metabolic capabilities, omnipresence in the natural world, and adaptability to extreme conditions, have emerged as promising candidates for synthetic biology (SynBio) applications. Recent advancements in genetic engineering, particularly CRISPR-based genome editing (GE), provide unprecedented opportunities to enhance microalgal traits for the sustainable bioproduction of oxygen, water, and nutrition in space missions. Engineered microalgae hold immense potential for bioregenerative life support systems (BLSS), supplying essential resources while reducing logistical constraints.

40737867,Precision nutrition for obesity management: A gut microbiota-centered weight-loss approach.,"Obesity is a complex and multifactorial condition strongly associated with metabolic burdens and cardiovascular diseases. This review focuses on precision nutrition as a strategy for obesity management, exploring how personalized interventions can modulate the composition and functionality of the gut microbiome to promote weight loss and improve metabolic health. A growing body of evidence suggests that imbalances in gut microbiota composition directly impact lipid metabolism, immune and inflammatory pathways, and appetite regulation mechanisms. Furthermore, the review discusses the relationship between gut microbiota and dietary factors, highlighting how certain types of diets (such as the Mediterranean diet and fiber-rich diets) can promote the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and the growth of beneficial bacteria associated with weight regulation and reduced inflammation. While diet is the primary factor modulating the gut microbiota, factors such as genetics and epigenetic characteristics, body composition, maternal nutritional, type of birth delivery, physical activity and even drug use also play significant roles in this modulation. Although the use of precision nutrition approaches still faces challenges, such as cost and variability in individual response, the integration of omics technologies, artificial intelligence, and machine learning appear to offer great potential as tools to identify specific microbial and genetic profiles that allow for the personalization of nutritional interventions. These technologies enable large-scale analysis of dietary, genomic, and microbial factors to create dietary strategies to prevent or treat obesity that meet the specific metabolic needs of each individual. Thus, the application of these tools in clinical settings could transform obesity management, creating data-driven interventions that enhance treatment effectiveness.",Carvalho LM; da Mota JCNL; Ribeiro AA; Carvalho BG; Martinez JA; Nicoletti CF,"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40737867/,1,0,0,0,0,0

40732073,Microbial Interconnections in One Health: A Critical Nexus Between Companion Animals and Human Microbiomes.,"The One Health approach is rapidly gaining the attention of the scientific community worldwide and is expected to be a major model of scientific reasoning in the 21st century, concerning medical, veterinary and environmental issues. The basic concept of One Health, that humans, animals and their environments are parts of the same natural world affecting each other, is rooted in most ethnic as well as in many religious traditions. Despite this unity and for historical reasons, medical, veterinary and environmental sciences developed independently. The One Health concept tries to reunite these and many other relevant sciences, aiming at a deeper understanding of the interconnection between the natural world, humans and animal health. The dynamic interplay between a host's microbiome, the microbiomes of other hosts, and environmental microbial communities profoundly influences the host health, given the essential physiological functions the microbiome performs within the organism. The biodiversity of microbiomes is broad and complex. The different areas of the skin, the upper and lower respiratory systems, the ocular cavity, the oral cavity, the gastrointestinal tract and finally the urogenital system of pets and humans alike are niches where a multitude of microorganisms indigenous and transient-commensals and pathogens, thrive in a dynamic antagonistic balance of populations of different phyla, orders, genera and species. The description of these microbiomes attempted in this article is not meant to be exhaustive but rather demonstrative of their complexity. The study of microbiomes is a necessary step towards the One Health approach to pets and humans. Yet, despite the progress made on that subject, the scientific community faces challenges, such as the limitations of studies performed, the scarcity of studies concerning the microbiomes of cats, the multitude of environmental factors affecting the results and others. The two new terms proposed in this article, the ""familiome"" and the ""oikiome"", will aid in the One Health theoretical analysis as well as in its practical approach. The authors strongly believe that new technological breakthroughs, like Big Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI), will significantly help to overcome these hazards.",Skoufos S; Stavropoulou E; Tsigalou C; Voidarou CC,Microorganisms,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40732073/,1,0,0,0,0,0

This consensus statement provides clinical guidance on the risk of hypophosphatemia development with ferric carboxymaltose and the approaches for management. To develop consensus recommendations regarding the clinical implications of hypophosphatemia after the administration of ferric carboxymaltose, the assessment of patient risk profile, and recommended approaches for risk reduction. <b>Methods:</b> Consensus statements were developed from an in-person meeting of specialists with expertise in iron pathophysiology and iron therapy and further supplemented with literature review. The multidisciplinary expert panel comprised global iron specialists spanning anesthesiology, cardiology, gastroenterology, obstetrics/gynecology, hematology, nephrology, and iron molecular biology. Structured discussions were held in an in-person meeting to gather expert opinion on the evidence base regarding intravenous iron and hypophosphatemia. Consolidated summary opinions underwent further iterations of panel review to form consensus recommendation statements. <b>Results:</b> The expert panel developed the following consensus statements: (1) Routine serum phosphate level measurement is not recommended for low-risk patients before or after treatment with ferric carboxymaltose, as most cases of hypophosphatemia that occur following the administration of ferric carboxymaltose are asymptomatic and transient; (2) patients receiving ferric carboxymaltose should be assessed for the degree of risk for developing symptomatic or severe hypophosphatemia prior to administration; (3) monitoring serum phosphate is recommended for patients at an increased risk for developing low serum phosphate or who require repeated courses of ferric carboxymaltose treatment at higher doses; (4) prophylactic oral phosphorus after ferric carboxymaltose is unlikely to effectively elevate phosphate and is not recommended for routine clinical practice; and (5) hypophosphatemic osteomalacia is rare and the risk of development after the administration of ferric carboxymaltose, in particular single infusion, is low. <b>Conclusions:</b> Hypophosphatemia following ferric carboxymaltose is predominantly asymptomatic and transient. Individuals at higher risk for developing hypophosphatemia with ferric carboxymaltose treatment include those who receive multiple infusions, higher cumulative doses, or long-term iron treatment or who have underlying clinical risk factors.

40703150,"Unveiling the multifaceted roles of anthocyanins: a review of their bioavailability, impacts on gut and system health, and industrial implications.","Anthocyanins, a class of flavonoids abundant in many fruits and vegetables, undergo complex catabolism, forming bioactive metabolites that profoundly affect a range of host physiological processes, including anti-inflammatory effects, modulation of oxidative stress, and modulation of the intestinal barrier. Despite this, the low bioavailability of anthocyanins presents challenges for their metabolic efficacy, health benefits, and therapeutic engagement <i>in vivo</i>. Therefore, the multifaceted roles of structurally diverse anthocyanins from different sources and the interplay between anthocyanin bioavailability and gut and systemic health were analyzed in depth. Additionally, we discuss how the dynamic gut microbial communities, i.e., growth/inhibition of certain microbial species, are regulated in diverse pathology models and the implications for anthocyanin metabolism and bioactivity in the context of gut and system health. A comprehensive analysis of the physicochemical factors affecting anthocyanin bioavailability and molecular mechanisms across disease models is undertaken. We further propose prospective techniques to enhance bioavailability, such as encapsulation, biotransformation, and omics-driven stratification of responder populations, as well as actionable insights for industry applications, including tailored food matrix design such as protein-polyphenol complexes, prebiotic co-delivery systems, and personalized nutrition strategies leveraging gut microbiota modulation. Ultimately, we advocate high-throughput analysis coupled with computational approaches such as AI-driven predictive modeling of anthocyanin-microbiota interactions to elucidate structure-activity relationships. These strategies are critical for determining whether observed health effects are attributable to anthocyanins per se or their synergistic/context-dependent actions, essential for enhancing bioavailability and therapeutic applications, thereby enabling rational dietary inclusion and therapeutic translation.",Gao F; Yang P; Wang W; Wang K; Zhao L; Wang Y; Liao X,Current research in food science,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40703150/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40689079,Genetic Landscape of Obesity in Children: Research Advances and Prospects.,"Obesity is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by excessive accumulation or uneven distribution of fat in the body, which poses a serious threat to health. Obesity significantly increases the risk of developing сonditions such as type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and some types of cancer. The prevalence of obesity, especially in childhood, has increased significantly worldwide over the past few decades. The World Health Organization predicts that 250 million children and adolescents aged 5-19 years will be obese by 2030, which indicates a global problem with far-reaching consequences. Advances in genomic technologies have led to the identification of multiple genetic loci associated with the disease ranging from severe cases with early onset to common multifactorial polygenic forms. Epigenetic changes driven by dietary and lifestyle factors are now recognized as crucial contributors to obesity. These modifications can alter gene expression and thereby link environmental influences to the observable clinical features of the disease. Significant progress has been made in deciphering the genetic architecture of obesity, particularly in pediatric populations. However, further advancement requires integrative multiomics analyses that encompass genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and microbiome data. To better understand the complex molecular underpinnings and clinical variability of obesity, researchers are increasingly applying methods from machine learning and artificial intelligence. These technologies help analyze large-scale genomic and phenotypic datasets, allowing for the identification of biological pathways involved in weight regulation. In the future, this may support the design of individualized diagnostic tools and targeted treatment plans that reflect a patient's genetic profile, lifestyle, and environmental exposures. To implement the principles of personalized and precision medicine in the treatment of obesity, it is crucial to identify risk profiles by assessing multiple contributing factors. This approach not only enables the prediction of an individual's risk of obesity and its associated diseases but also facilitates the optimization of treatment based on the patient's genetic profile. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of childhood obesity, including its prevalence, genetic determinants, and pathophysiological mechanisms.

40688481,Integrating digital health into pediatric obesity management: Current practices and future perspectives.,"Childhood obesity is a growing global health concern with significant cardiometabolic consequences. While conventional treatment approaches often fail to achieve sustained outcomes, emerging digital health interventions (DHIs)-including mobile applications, educational video games, wearable devices, telemedicine, and social media-offer innovative tools to support lifestyle modifications and enhance therapeutic adherence. In this narrative review, we focus on the main evidence regarding the effectiveness of DHIs for pediatric obesity treatment according to target (children vs. children with families) and duration (short- and long-term interventions). We also review their impact on clinical (e.g. body mass index, body composition, etc.), behavioral (physical activity, nutrition, adherence) and psychosocial (motivation, engagement) outcomes. In addition, future trends in the field are also discussed. DHIs demonstrate short-term effectiveness, especially when they incorporate personalization, interactivity, and family involvement. Mobile applications and educational video games boost nutritional literacy and promote healthy behaviours. Wearable devices encourage physical activity awareness, though adherence often varies. Long-term, family-based interventions help reduce dropout rates and reinforce lasting healthy habits. Guided use of social media can facilitate health education but also exposes users to risks such as misinformation and unhealthy food marketing. Despite these advancements, DHIs still face major challenges, including unequal access, data privacy concerns, and a lack of long-term outcome evaluations. The increasing prevalence of pediatric obesity underscores the urgent need for effective and sustainable treatment strategies. DHIs represent a promising, scalable approach for managing childhood obesity, but their long-term sustainability and effectiveness remain to be fully established.

These streamlined systems not only reduce handling steps and turnaround time but also enhance sensitivity and enable multiplexed detection of low-abundance nucleic acid targets. As such, one-pot CRISPR diagnostics are poised to transform point-of-care testing, pathogen surveillance, and clinical diagnostics. In this review, we summarize the latest advances in one-pot CRISPR-based detection technologies, evaluate their current limitations, and discuss strategies for optimization. Future efforts should focus on refining reaction kinetics, improving reagent stability, reducing costs, and expanding the repertoire of detectable targets. Furthermore, integration with portable platforms, AI-assisted signal interpretation, and the discovery of novel Cas effectors will be pivotal in realizing the full potential of CRISPR-based one-pot systems in diverse real-world applications.",Li X; Liu J; Wang R; Fu H; Kim M; Li X; Peng W; Man S; Gao Z; Ma L,Biosensors & bioelectronics,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40680677/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40676597,"Multi-ancestry genome-wide meta-analysis of 56,241 individuals identifies known and novel cross-population and ancestry-specific associations as novel risk loci for Alzheimer's disease.","Limited ancestral diversity has impaired our ability to detect risk variants more prevalent in ancestry groups of predominantly non-European ancestral background in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We construct and analyze a multi-ancestry GWAS dataset in the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) to test for novel shared and population-specific late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) susceptibility loci and evaluate underlying genetic architecture in 37,382 non-Hispanic White (NHW), 6728 African American, 8899 Hispanic (HIS), and 3232 East Asian individuals, performing within ancestry fixed-effects meta-analysis followed by a cross-ancestry random-effects meta-analysis. We identify 13 loci with cross-population associations including known loci at/near CR1, BIN1, TREM2, CD2AP, PTK2B, CLU, SHARPIN, MS4A6A, PICALM, ABCA7, APOE, and two novel loci not previously reported at 11p12 (LRRC4C) and 12q24.13 (LHX5-AS1). We additionally identify three population-specific loci with genome-wide significance at/near PTPRK and GRB14 in HIS and KIAA0825 in NHW. Pathway analysis implicates multiple amyloid regulation pathways and the classical complement pathway. Genes at/near our novel loci have known roles in neuronal development (LRRC4C, LHX5-AS1, and PTPRK) and insulin receptor activity regulation (GRB14). Using cross-population GWAS meta-analyses, we identify novel LOAD susceptibility loci in/near LRRC4C and LHX5-AS1, both with known roles in neuronal development, as well as several novel population-unique loci. Reflecting the power of diverse ancestry in GWAS, we detect the SHARPIN locus with only 13.7% of the sample size of the NHW GWAS study (n = 409,589) in which this locus was first observed. Continued expansion into larger multi-ancestry studies will provide even more power for further elucidating the genomics of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.",Rajabli F; Benchek P; Tosto G; Kushch N; Sha J; Bazemore K; Zhu C; Lee WP; Haut J; Hamilton-Nelson KL; Wheeler NR; Zhao Y; Farrell JJ; Grunin MA; Leung YY; Kuksa PP; Li D; da Fonseca EL; Mez JB; Palmer EL; Pillai J; Sherva RM; Song YE; Zhang X; Ikeuchi T; Iqbal T; Pathak O; Valladares O; Reyes-Dumeyer D; Kuzma AB; Abner E; Adams LD; Adams PM; Aguirre A; Albert MS; Albin RL; Allen M; Alvarez L; Apostolova LG; Arnold SE; Asthana S; Atwood CS; Auerbach S; Ayres G; Baldwin CT; Barber RC; Barnes LL; Barral S; Beach TG; Becker JT; Beecham GW; Beekly D; Benitez BA; Bennett D; Bertelson J; Bird TD; Blacker D; Boeve BF; Bowen JD; Boxer A; Brewer J; Burke JR; Burns JM; Buxbaum JD; Cairns NJ; Cantwell LB; Cao C; Carlson CS; Carlsson CM; Carney RM; Carrasquillo MM; Chasse S; Chesselet MF; Chin NA; Chui HC; Chung J; Craft S; Crane PK; Cribbs DH; Crocco EA; Cruchaga C; Cuccaro ML; Cullum M; Darby E; Davis B; De Jager PL; DeCarli C; DeToledo J; Dick M; Dickson DW; Dombroski BA; Doody RS; Duara R; Ertekin-Taner N; Evans DA; Faber KM; Fairchild TJ; Fallon KB; Fardo DW; Farlow MR; Fernandez-Hernandez V; Ferris S; Friedland RP; Foroud TM; Frosch MP; Fulton-Howard B; Galasko DR; Gamboa A; Gearing M; Geschwind DH; Ghetti B; Gilbert JR; Go RCP; Goate AM; Grabowski TJ; Graff-Radford NR; Green RC; Growdon JH; Hakonarson H; Hall J; Hamilton RL; Harari O; Hardy J; Harrell LE; Head E; Henderson VW; Hernandez M; Hohman T; Honig LS; Huebinger RM; Huentelman MJ; Hulette CM; Hyman BT; Hynan LS; Ibanez L; Jarvik GP; Jayadev S; Jin LW; Johnson K; Johnson L; Kamboh MI; Karydas AM; Katz MJ; Kauwe JS; Kaye JA; Keene CD; Khaleeq A; Kikuchi M; Kim R; Knebl J; Kowall NW; Kramer JH; Kukull WA; LaFerla FM; Lah JJ; Larson EB; Lerner A; Leverenz JB; Levey AI; Lieberman AP; Lipton RB; Logue M; Lopez OL; Lunetta KL; Lyketsos CG; Mains D; Margaret FE; Marson DC; Martin ER; Martiniuk F; Mash DC; Masliah E; Massman P; Masurkar A; McCormick WC; McCurry SM; McDavid AN; McDonough S; McKee AC; Mesulam M; Miller BL; Miller CA; Miller JW; Montine TJ; Monuki ES; Morris JC; Mukherjee S; Myers AJ; Nguyen T; Obisesan T; O'Bryant S; Olichney JM; Ory M; Palmer R; Parisi JE; Paulson HL; Pavlik V; Paydarfar D; Perez V; Peskind E; Petersen RC; Petrovitch H; Pierce A; Polk M; Poon WW; Potter H; Qu L; Quiceno M; Quinn JF; Raj A; Raskind M; Reiman EM; Reisberg B; Reisch JS; Ringman JM; Roberson ED; Rodriguear M; Rogaeva E; Rosen HJ; Rosenberg RN; Royall DR; Sabbagh M; Sadovnick AD; Sager MA; Sano M; Saykin AJ; Schneider JA; Schneider LS; Seeley WW; Slifer SH; Small S; Smith AG; Smith JP; Sonnen JA; Spina S; George-Hyslop PS; Starks TD; Stern RA; Stevens AB; Strittmatter SM; Sultzer D; Swerdlow RH; Tanzi RE; Tilson JL; Trojanowski JQ; Troncoso JC; Tsolaki M; Tsuang DW; Van Deerlin VM; van Eldik LJ; Vance JM; Vardarajan BN; Vassar R; Vinters HV; Vonsattel JP; Weintraub S; Welsh-Bohmer KA; Whitehead PL; Wijsman EM; Wilhelmsen KC; Williams B; Williamson J; Wilms H; Wingo TS; Wisniewski T; Woltjer RL; Woon M; Wright CB; Wu CK; Younkin SG; Yu CE; Yu L; Zhu X; Kunkle BW; Bush WS; Miyashita A; Byrd GS; Wang LS; Farrer LA; Haines JL; Mayeux R; Pericak-Vance MA; Schellenberg GD; Jun GR; Reitz C; Naj AC,Genome biology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40676597/,0,0,0,1,0,0
40676220,Rheumatoid hand massage therapy to mitigate sarcopenia and improve patients' quality of life: a hypothesis.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory disorder frequently associated with sarcopenia, a gradual decline in skeletal muscle mass and strength. Hand sarcopenia in RA leads to functional deterioration and diminished quality of life. Although conventional methods, such as exercise and nutrition, are typically used, current evidence suggests that massage therapy may offer advantages through anti-inflammatory, circulatory, and anabolic pathways. This hypothesis-driven article proposes that targeted hand massage may alleviate sarcopenia in RA by enhancing local perfusion, modulating immunological responses, mitigating oxidative stress, and stimulating muscle-regenerative pathways. Experimental investigations in animals and humans have demonstrated that massage can activate mechanotransduction signaling, enhance muscle protein synthesis, stimulate satellite cell activity, and reduce inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6. Moreover, enhancements in handgrip strength and muscle oxygenation have been documented after mechanical interventions. Small sample sizes, diverse methodologies, and the absence of standardized massage procedures limit the clinical validity of the data. Randomized controlled trials involving RA patients with compromised hand function and sarcopenia are necessary to explore this hypothesis. Standardized outcome measures, such as handgrip strength, disease activity scores, muscle tissue imaging, and inflammatory biomarkers, are required to assess efficacy. If verified, massage therapy may provide a non-invasive, low-risk complement to established care, potentially enhancing muscle function and quality of life in RA patients with sarcopenia.",Kocyigit BF; Zimba O; Yessirkepov M; Khojakulova U,Rheumatology international,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40676220/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40675491,Biomarkers for individualized nutritional therapy in disease-related malnutrition: a narrative review.,"Disease-related malnutrition in hospitalized adult medical patients is a syndrome associated with substantially higher morbidity, disability, both short- and long-term mortality, delayed recovery, and increased healthcare costs compared with individuals without malnutrition. Research on malnutrition has aimed to translate existing knowledge of its pathophysiology into improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize current evidence on the use of biomarkers to individualize nutritional therapy. There is particular interest in developing nutritional interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of disease-related malnutrition within hospital environments. Recent high-quality randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that nutritional therapy significantly reduces morbidity and other complications associated with malnutrition in selected patient populations. Additionally, there is growing evidence that phenotyping patients through assessing nutritional biomarkers or adapted risk screening scores may enhance our ability to characterize them in terms of prognosis and likelihood of treatment response. Currently, several promising biomarkers have been identified, including markers of inflammation (e.g. C-reactive protein and interleukin-6), indicators of chronic disease (e.g. creatinine, prealbumin, albumin, and red cell distribution width), measures of muscle health (e.g. hand grip strength and computed tomography scan results), endocrine and exocrine markers, estimates of catabolism as well as emerging metabolomic indicators. Although the clinical use of individual biomarkers requires careful assessment, machine learning and artificial intelligence show promise for improving the analysis and interpretation of existing data in the near future. It is crucial to use biomarkers to distinguish etiology at an individual level when implementing nutritional treatment interventions. The key challenge ahead is to determine the most effective way to incorporate these biomarkers into established assessment tools, optimizing personalized nutritional care for patients with malnutrition.",Wunderle C; Urbach K; Buchmueller L; Randegger S; Kaegi-Braun N; Laviano A; van Zanten AR; Seres DS; Schuetz P,The American journal of clinical nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40675491/,1,0,0,0,0,0

However, hypertension is mainly preventable, highlighting the need for effective prevention strategies to mitigate this critical health concern. This scoping review aimed to identify existing knowledge gaps and provide a comprehensive understanding of hypertension prevention interventions. Keywords were identified, and an unrestricted search for empirical studies was conducted until December 20, 2024. The search strategy encompassed 11 databases. Ultimately, studies focusing on preventive interventions targeting the Thai population at risk of hypertension were included in this review. Finally, we included 41 studies: 35 in community settings, two in hospital clinics, and four in Buddhist temples. The total number of participants was 16,401, ranging from 32 to 4,786, aged between 18 and 74. Research designs comprised 32 quasi-experimental studies, seven randomized controlled trials, one action research, and one research and development. Researchers primarily delivered interventions. The interventions focused on hypertension monitoring, knowledge promotion, health behavior modification, social support, and counseling, emphasizing preventive behaviors, nutrition promotion, and disease awareness. Researchers commonly took outcome measurements before and 12 weeks after intervention. Manuals, logbooks, and lectures with presentation slides were the primary platforms. Finally, knowledge, behaviors, and biomarkers were the most frequently assessed outcomes. This scoping review provided recommendations that future research should expand intervention strategies, emphasize biomarkers, adopt modern delivery methods like AI chatbots and mobile apps, and include follow-ups beyond 12 weeks to ensure lasting impact.",Banharak S; Potempa K; Limpawattana P; Pamungkas RA; Mahikul W; Jeamjitvibool T; Karaket A; Siriprathum S; Ransinyo K,Vascular health and risk management,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40661694/,0,0,0,0,0,1
40660482,"A Review of Processing, Marketing, and Demographic Influence on Consumer Perception of Pulse Milk- Insights From Traditional and AI-Facilitated Research.","Sustainable, healthy, and environmental concerns are part of the reasons consumers are shifting to plant-based diets, such as plant-based milk, which has reduced greenhouse gas emissions and water footprint as an advantage over animal-based diets. Pulse crops such as lentils, lupins, chickpeas, and peas offer nutritious and health benefits, containing proteins, dietary fiber, and low-fat content, as well as soil health restoration and cropping diversification as environmental benefits. Pulse milk is gaining popularity as one of the broader plant-based milk categories that offer beneficial dairy alternatives. This review summarizes the impact of processing, marketing, and demographic variables and how they influence consumer perception of pulse milk. We also highlighted insights from artificial intelligence (AI) and traditional research methods to understand consumer choices. The consumer acceptance of pulses faces some challenges despite their benefits, related to sensory attributes such as beany, earthy, and grassy off-flavors and the lack of culinary knowledge amongst consumers. The lower government subsidies for pulses compared to common crops and the lack of sustainability benefits awareness by some consumers limit pulse crop production. Advanced processing techniques like enzymatic treatments and homogenization can enhance pulse milk sensory quality. Marketing strategies tailored to target different demographics can encourage consumption. When developing a food product, analyzing relationships becomes difficult when there are multi-faceted variables to consider. The gap in traditional research methods can be bridged with AI-facilitated methods in predicting consumer preferences in product development. Further research is needed to enhance the nutritional and sensory quality of pulse milk.",Ifeh C; Whitaker B; Nazemi N; Greenwood M; Miles M; Kuo WY,Journal of food science,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40660482/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40658800,Generative AI in hepatology: Transforming multimodal patient-generated data into actionable insights.,"Cirrhosis care is inherently complex, marked by a high risk of acute decompensation and significant morbidity and mortality. Traditional episodic care models provide static snapshots of a patient's condition, limiting the ability to address dynamic changes in clinical status. Emerging at-home monitoring technologies and wearable devices present numerous opportunities to generate continuous clinical data, but the integration of this data into clinical workflows remains challenging. Large language models (LLMs) and generative AI (GenAI) technologies offer innovative solutions by enabling the acquisition, summarization, and actionable analysis of multimodal data generated by patients. This review explores the application of home-monitoring technologies for key complications of cirrhosis, including HE, ascites, and frailty. GenAI will enable the integration of these home-based data with canonical clinical data acquisition. We discuss the role of GenAI technologies and LLMs in processing multimodal data, supporting clinical decision-making, and creating autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents capable of triaging and summarizing patient data. In addition, we offer perspectives on the clinical evaluation of these emerging technologies. Finally, we close with a ""not-so-distant"" vision of GenAI-enabled at-home cirrhosis care.",Lai M; Chen IY; Lai JC; Ge J,Hepatology communications,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40658800/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40654107,A Scoping Review on Artificial Intelligence-Supported Interventions for Nonpharmacologic Management of Chronic Rheumatic Diseases.,"This review summarizes artificial intelligence (AI)-supported nonpharmacological interventions for adults with chronic rheumatic diseases, detailing their components, purpose, and current evidence base. We searched Embase, PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus databases for studies describing AI-supported interventions for adults with chronic rheumatic diseases. Eligible interventions targeted clinical outcomes (pain, function, disability, fatigue), psychological measures (depression, anxiety), or behavioral outcomes (physical activity, nutrition). All publication types (journal articles, conference abstracts, protocols) published in the English language until January 19, 2025, were considered, and interventions of any duration, frequency, country of origin, or setting (inpatient, outpatient, community, home setting) were included. Two reviewers independently screened studies, and one extracted data on study characteristics, intervention components, AI methodologies, and outcomes. Fifteen AI-supported interventions were identified, primarily targeting osteoarthritis (73%) and focusing on education and exercise advice (67%). The most common AI tool was rule-based expert systems (40%), followed by natural language processing systems (33%) and machine learning algorithms (27%). The interventions ranged from 3 weeks to 12 months, whereas sample sizes ranged from 7 to 427 participants, reflecting huge variability across studies. Most interventions demonstrated high usability, engagement, and adherence. Improvements in exercise compliance, physical activity, and symptoms, such as pain and physical function, were reported, though effects varied across studies and were sometimes not sustained long term. AI-supported interventions show promise in promoting education, exercise, and behavioral guidance for adults with chronic rheumatic diseases. There is evidence for high usability and engagement, but the clinical impact on long-term symptom management is uncertain.",Shah N; Castellanos A; Chen Y; Piette J; Bucher A; Murphy S,Arthritis care & research,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40654107/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40650958,Prediabetes phenotypes: can aetiology and risk profile guide lifestyle strategies for diabetes prevention?,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) continues to worsen globally alongside rise in obesity. Asymptomatic dysglycaemia, which precedes T2D, provides opportunities to identify those at risk and target prevention but prediabetes is highly variable. Not all with overweight develop dysglycaemia and not all with dysglycaemia are overweight. Important is the deposition of ectopic lipids in the pancreas, liver, and muscle. With no international definition, several prediabetes phenotypes exist, each based on one or more components of fasting glucose, postprandial glucose and/or HbA<sub>1c</sub>. We address variability in prediabetes phenotype and absence of a universal definition. With four main phenotypes based on the various glycemic definitions, it is likely they have different etiologies, risk profiles, timelines to T2D, and response to lifestyle intervention. Who do we treat, and when? Do we treat early or late? What is the optimum diet for T2D prevention? Do different phenotypes require different prevention approaches? Personalized lifestyle, or phenotype-specific treatments, are likely to be more successful for T2D prevention than a 'one-size-fits-all' approach. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods, currently in their infancy, are expected to revolutionize personalized nutrition with integration of 'big data' better characterizing and predicting prediabetes phenotype, and phenotype-specific response to diet and lifestyle interventions.",Poppitt SD; Miles-Chan J; Silvestre MP,Expert review of endocrinology & metabolism,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40650958/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40647258,"Functional Foods in Modern Nutrition Science: Mechanisms, Evidence, and Public Health Implications.","In recent years, functional foods have garnered increasing scientific and public health interest due to their potential to confer physiological benefits beyond basic nutritional value. International bodies such as EFSA, FDA, and WHO define functional foods as those containing bioactive components that may contribute to the prevention and management of chronic non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers. The evolving paradigm of ""food as medicine"" reflects a broader shift in nutritional science towards proactive, health-oriented dietary strategies. This article provides a comprehensive, interdisciplinary overview of functional foods by examining their biological mechanisms, clinical evidence, public health significance, regulatory frameworks, and future prospects-particularly in the context of advances in personalized nutrition and nutrigenomics. A thorough literature review was conducted, drawing from recent peer-reviewed studies and guidelines from key health authorities. The review highlights the roles of specific compounds such as probiotics and prebiotics in modulating the gut microbiome, flavonoids and polyphenols in anti-inflammatory processes, omega-3 fatty acids in cardiometabolic regulation, and vitamins and minerals in supporting immune function. While an expanding body of clinical trials and meta-analyses supports the health benefits of these compounds-including reductions in LDL cholesterol, improved insulin sensitivity, and mitigation of oxidative stress-the integration of functional foods into everyday diets remains challenging. Socioeconomic disparities and limited health literacy often impede their accessibility and widespread adoption in public health practice. Functional foods represent a promising component of prevention-focused modern healthcare. To maximize their impact, a coordinated, evidence-based approach is essential, involving collaboration among healthcare professionals, nutrition scientists, policymakers, and the food industry. Looking forward, innovations in artificial intelligence, microbiome research, and genomic technologies may unlock novel opportunities for the targeted and effective application of functional foods in population health.",Fekete M; Lehoczki A; Kryczyk-Poprawa A; Zábó V; Varga JT; Bálint M; Fazekas-Pongor V; Csípő T; Rząsa-Duran E; Varga P,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40647258/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40647079,"Reforming Food, Drug, and Nutraceutical Regulations to Improve Public Health and Reduce Healthcare Costs.","Neglecting preventive healthcare policies has contributed to the global surge in chronic diseases, increased hospitalizations, declining quality of care, and escalating costs. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs)-notably cardiovascular conditions, diabetes, and cancer-consume over 80% of healthcare expenditure and account for more than 60% of global deaths, which are projected to exceed 75% by 2030. Poor diets, sedentary lifestyles, regulatory loopholes, and underfunded public health initiatives are driving this crisis. Compounding the issue are flawed policies, congressional lobbying, and conflicts of interest that prioritize costly, hospital-based, symptom-driven care over identifying and treating to eliminate root causes and disease prevention. Regulatory agencies are failing to deliver their intended functions. For instance, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) broad oversight across drugs, devices, food, and supplements has resulted in inefficiencies, reduced transparency, and public safety risks. This broad mandate has allowed the release of unsafe drugs, food additives, and supplements, contributing to the rising childhood diseases, the burden of chronic illness, and over-medicalization. The author proposes separating oversight responsibilities: transferring authority over food, supplements, and OTC products to a new Food and Nutraceutical Agency (FNA), allowing the FDA to be restructured as the Drug and Device Agency (DDA), to refocus on pharmaceuticals and medical devices. While complete reform requires Congressional action, interim policy shifts are urgently needed to improve public health. Broader structural changes-including overhauling the Affordable Care Act, eliminating waste and fraud, redesigning regulatory and insurance systems, and eliminating intermediaries are essential to reducing costs, improving care, and transforming national and global health outcomes.

40645039,Artificial intelligence in nutrition and ageing research - A primer on the benefits.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly impacting multiple domains. The application of AI in nutrition and ageing research has significant potential to transform healthcare outcomes for the ageing population. This review provides critical insights into how AI techniques-such as machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning-are used in the context of care for older people to predict health outcomes, identify risk factors, and enhance dietary assessments. Trained on large datasets, AI models have demonstrated high accuracy in diagnosing malnutrition, predicting bone mineral density abnormalities, and forecasting risks of chronic diseases, thereby addressing significant gaps in early detection and intervention strategies. In addition, we review novel applications of AI in automating dietary intake assessments through image recognition and analysing eating behaviours; these offer innovative tools for personalised nutrition interventions. The review also discusses and showcases the integration of AI in research logistics, such as AI-assisted literature screening and data synthesis, which can accelerate scientific discovery in this domain. Despite these promising advancements, there are critical challenges hindering the widespread adoption of AI, including issues around data quality, ethical considerations, and the interpretability of AI models. By addressing these barriers, the review underscores the necessity for interdisciplinary collaboration to best harness AI's potential. Our goal is for this review to serve as a guide for researchers and practitioners aiming to understand and leverage AI technologies in nutrition and healthy ageing.

40644951,Genomic diversity of Cronobacter sakazakii across the food system to consumers at the global scale.,"Understanding how foodborne pathogens adapt to changing environments is essential for improving food safety monitoring and control. Cronobacter sakazakii, a persistent opportunistic pathogen associated with powdered infant formula outbreaks, poses critical health risks to neonates and other vulnerable populations. This study tested the hypothesis that genetic variation in C. sakazakii correlates with specific isolation sources and geographic origins across the global food system. We conducted a pangenomics meta-analysis of C. sakazakii derived from food, environmental, and clinical sources spanning North America, Asia, and Europe. A robust fine-tuned Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model was developed to standardize the categorization of isolate metadata descriptors. C. sakazakii genome assemblies (n = 748) were used to build and annotate the pangenome, and genome size and accessory gene profiles were found to be significantly associated with source type and continent of origin. Isolates from powdered foods, compared to those sourced from alternative foods, had larger genomes and were enriched in functions annotated to Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COG) category L for DNA replication, recombination and repair (e.g., transposase, integrase), among other features. Random forest models using both accessory genes and the subset of virulence factor homologs accurately predicted source attributions, identifying type VI secretion system and heavy metal response genes as key indicators of isolate origins. Several antimicrobial resistance genes associated with efflux (i.e., arlR, facT, oprZ) also exhibited patterns for biogeography. Overall, this study uncovered the distribution of key accessory genetic elements of C. sakazakii throughout the food system, revealing putative adaptations for its persistence and transmission.

However, real-world implementation of LM is often hindered by patient adherence issues, limited clinical time, and the need for ongoing personalized support. Artificial intelligence (AI), with its capabilities in data processing, pattern recognition, and predictive modeling, presents a unique opportunity to overcome these barriers and enhance the reach and precision of LM interventions. This narrative review explores AI's integration into LM's core domains. In nutrition, AI facilitates real-time dietary assessment and personalized recommendations through image recognition and machine learning. In physical activity and fitness, AI-powered wearable devices deliver tailored feedback, support virtual coaching, and predict injury risk. AI applications in sleep medicine allow for continuous, non-invasive monitoring and the early detection of sleep disorders. AI-driven cognitive behavioral therapy chatbots and biosensor-based stress prediction tools provide scalable, cost-effective support for mental health and stress management. Moreover, AI is pivotal in chronic disease prevention by integrating lifestyle data with electronic health records to forecast disease trajectories and optimize interventions. Despite these advances, several challenges remain. Data privacy concerns, algorithmic bias, regulatory ambiguities, and varying user trust and engagement levels must be addressed to ensure equitable and ethical implementation. AI's integration with digital twin technology and precision LM represents the next frontier in personalized health. As LM continues to evolve, AI will be indispensable in driving a more proactive, participatory, and person-centered model of care that meets the complex demands of chronic disease management in the 21st century.",Saeed DK; Nashwan AJ,Cureus,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40636636/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40626375,Applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Prediabetes: A Scoping Review.,"Prediabetes is a prevalent condition in which early detection and lifestyle interventions can prevent or delay progression to diabetes. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) offer enhanced tools for diagnosis, risk stratification, and scalable delivery of lifestyle interventions. This review synthesizes current applications of AI/ML in patients with prediabetes. We conducted a scoping review using PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science (through May 2025) to identify original studies applying AI/ML to prediabetes prediction or management. Population-level forecasting and models combining prediabetes with other conditions were excluded. Data were extracted via structured REDCap instruments and validated through secondary review. Descriptive statistics summarized findings. Of 2072 records screened, 149 studies met criteria: 118 prediction model studies, 20 intervention studies, and 11 miscellaneous. Machine learning models primarily targeted prediction of prediabetes, progression to diabetes, diabetic complications, and glucose metrics. Overall model performance was favorable (mean C-statistic 0.81), with random forests, neural networks, and support vector machines showing better performance. Only 20 studies reported external validation, few compared ML to standard risk tools, and data/code availability was limited. Six AI-based diabetes prevention programs showed positive clinical outcomes, though randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence was limited. Three personalized nutrition interventions showed mixed efficacy. Most AI/ML research in prediabetes focused on predictive modeling, which shows promise but limited translation to real-world settings. Artificial intelligence-based interventions may scale behavioral change support but need further evaluation versus standard care.

40611325,"Emerging phenotype: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5 (MODY-5) - mechanisms, clinical spectrum, and unmet needs.","Type 5 Diabetes or MODY-5 has recently emerged as a rare yet distinct phenotype among pediatric diabetes disorders, characterized predominantly by mutations in critical genes such as HNF1B and PPARG. Unlike more common diabetes types, this atypical form demonstrates extensive multisystem involvement, presenting clinically through diverse manifestations including renal cysts, pancreatic hypoplasia, growth disturbances, and neurological complications. Genetic analyses underscore its significant heterogeneity, illustrating a complex interplay among genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications, and environmental triggers that collectively shape its distinct pathogenesis. Molecular disruptions prominently include alterations in NF-κB signaling pathways, increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and heightened profibrotic TGF-β activity, leading to early and severe multisystem complications. Despite these insights, clinical misclassification remains frequent, largely because diagnostic tools continue to prioritize conventional parameters such as HbA1c and fasting glucose rather than molecular diagnostics. Moreover, the absence of validated biomarkers specific to Type 5 Diabetes further impedes timely and precise diagnosis, underscoring critical gaps in current clinical practice. Addressing these diagnostic and therapeutic gaps necessitates expanded genetic screening, enhanced clinician education, and the establishment of subtype-specific clinical guidelines. This review proposes a structured framework to drive future diagnostic and therapeutic advancements, ultimately facilitating personalized management and improved outcomes for affected pediatric populations.",Nurkolis F; Syahputra RA; Nugrahanto AP; Taslim NA; Mustika A; Tjandrawinata RR; Harbuwono DS; Soegondo S,Diabetology & metabolic syndrome,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40611325/,1,0,0,0,0,0

To systematically examine the diagnostic accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) models applied to various biomarkers in IBS diagnosis. A comprehensive search of six databases identified 18053 articles published up to May 31, 2024. Following screening and eligibility criteria, six observational studies involving 1366 participants from the United Kingdom, China, and Japan were included. Risk of bias and reporting quality were assessed using quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies-2, prediction model risk of bias assessment tool-AI, and transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis-AI tools. Key metrics included sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC). The included studies applied AI models such as random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks to biomarkers like fecal microbiome composition, gas chromatography data, neuroimaging features, and protease activity. Diagnostic accuracy ranged from 54% to 98% (AUC: 0.61-0.99). Models using fecal microbiome data achieved the highest performance, with one study reporting 98% sensitivity and specificity (AUC = 0.99). While most studies demonstrated high methodological quality, significant variability in datasets, biomarkers, and validation methods limited meta-analysis feasibility and generalizability.

40573163,Microbiota-Accessible Borates as Novel and Emerging Prebiotics for Healthy Longevity: Current Research Trends and Perspectives.,"Precision nutrition-targeted gut microbiota (GM) may have therapeutic potential not only for age-related diseases but also for slowing the aging process and promoting longer healthspan. Recent studies have shown that restoring a healthy symbiosis of GM by counteracting dysbiosis (DYS) through precise nutritional intervention is becoming a major target for extending healthspan. Microbiota-accessible borate (MAB) complexes, such as boron (B)-pectins (rhamnogalacturonan-borate) and borate-phenolic esters (diester chlorogenoborate), have a significant impact on healthy host-microbiota symbiosis (HMS). The mechanism of action of MABs involves the biosynthesis of the autoinducer-2-borate (AI-2B) signaling molecule, B fortification of the mucus gel layer by the MABs diet, inhibition of pathogenic microbes, and reversal of GM DYS, strengthening the gut barrier structure, enhancing immunity, and promoting overall host health. In fact, the lack of MAB complexes in the human diet causes reduced levels of AI-2B in GM, inhibiting the <i>Firmicutes</i> phylum (the main butyrate-producing bacteria), with important effects on healthy HMS. It can now be argued that there is a relationship between MAB-rich intake, healthy HMS, host metabolic health, and longevity. This could influence the deployment of natural prebiotic B-based nutraceuticals targeting the colon in the future. Our review is based on the discovery that MAB diet is absolutely necessary for healthy HMS in humans, by reversing DYS and restoring eubiosis for longer healthspan.",Biţă A; Scorei IR; Soriano-Ursúa MA; Mogoşanu GD; Belu I; Ciocîlteu MV; Biţă CE; Rău G; Pisoschi CG; Racu MV; Pinzaru I; Contreras-Ramos A; Kostici R; Neamţu J; Biciuşcă V; Gheonea DI,"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40573163/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40573089,Integrating Traditional Nutritional Wisdom into Digital Nutrition Platforms: Toward Culturally Adaptive and Inclusive Health Technologies.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Traditional nutritional knowledge, shaped by centuries of cultural and ecological adaptation, offers holistic and sustainable dietary frameworks that remain highly relevant to modern health challenges. However, current digital nutrition platforms often fail to reflect this diversity, relying instead on standardized models with limited cultural sensitivity. This paper aims to explore how traditional nutritional wisdom can be integrated into digital health platforms to promote more inclusive and effective approaches to personalized nutrition. <b>Methods:</b> This perspective paper employs a cultural adaptation framework to analyze the integration of traditional food knowledge into digital contexts. Drawing from interdisciplinary research across nutrition science, anthropology, digital health and implementation science, we utilize the Knowledge-to-Action (KTA) Framework and the PEN-3 Cultural Model to structure our analysis. A systematic scoping review of literature published between 2010 and 2025 was conducted to identify integration challenges and opportunities. Additionally, we analyzed case studies of three traditional dietary systems (Argentina, Italy and Japan) and evaluated five leading digital nutrition platforms for their degree of cultural inclusivity, using qualitative comparative methods. <b>Results:</b> The analysis highlights significant challenges in adapting traditional knowledge to digital formats, including standardization barriers, contextual loss and technological limitations. However, successful integration initiatives demonstrate that through participatory design, flexible data architectures and culturally-informed algorithms, traditional food systems can be meaningfully represented. Our proposed four-phase integration framework-documentation, digital adaptation, implementation and evaluation-provides a structured approach for developers and researchers. <b>Conclusions:</b> Bridging traditional nutrition with digital platforms represents a vital opportunity to enhance personalization and preserve food heritage while improving health outcomes for diverse populations. This integration requires interdisciplinary collaboration, user-centered design processes and ethical approaches that respect cultural ownership and context.",Suarez C; Adibi S,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40573089/,0,0,0,0,0,0

40566324,The Role of Food Consumption in the Global Syndemic: A Scoping Review and Conceptual Model.,"The increase in chronic diseases and climate change in recent decades has been driven by food systems that affect both human health and the environment. This study investigated the interrelation between food consumption, obesity, undernutrition, and climate change, aiming to understand how these factors connect within the global syndemic. The methodology used was a scoping review, in which 12 articles were analyzed after an initial search that resulted in 11,208 references. The references were screened using the Rayyan software (Rayyan Systems Inc. (Doha, Qatar), version 1.6.1 and web-based version), removing duplicates and assessing the studies based on eligibility criteria. The articles addressed different aspects, such as the relationship between food consumption, obesity, undernutrition, and climate change, providing data on how food insecurity and socioeconomic conditions influence these conditions. In sequence, we developed a conceptual model to offer a detailed view of the factors affecting the global syndemic, considering the availability of food, its accessibility, stability in supply, and its use in the diet. The model recognizes that climate change affects food consumption both directly and indirectly. Direct effects include the impact of extreme weather events-such as floods and droughts-on the availability, access, quantity, and quality of food. Indirectly, climate change exacerbates socioeconomic vulnerabilities and disrupts food systems in more structural ways, contributing to increased food insecurity. The findings revealed that food insecurity, in turn, can lead to both obesity and undernutrition, particularly among vulnerable populations. There was a scarcity of studies that integrated the relationship between undernutrition, climate change, and food consumption, especially in certain regional contexts such as Latin America. The evidence gathered in the literature and the conceptual model provide a foundation for future research and the development of more effective public policies that integrate food issues, public health, and climate change in a more holistic and interconnected approach.",Garrido G; Severo FC; Bonfim SMV; Dias LF; Domingos ALG; Jones AD; Saraiva AM; Marchioni DML; Junior EV; Ribeiro EMS; Jolliet O; Sarti FM; de Carvalho AM,International journal of environmental research and public health,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40566324/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40565936,Nutrition and Diet Patterns as Key Modulators of Metabolic Reprogramming in Melanoma Immunotherapy.,"<b>Background</b>: Melanoma, one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer, has seen significant therapeutic advances with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). However, many patients fail to respond or develop resistance, creating the need for adjunct strategies. <b>Objective</b>: The objective of this study is to critically evaluate how specific dietary patterns and nutrient-derived metabolites modulate melanoma metabolism and immunotherapy outcomes, emphasizing translational implications. <b>Methods</b>: We performed an integrative review of preclinical and clinical studies investigating dietary interventions in melanoma models and ICI-treated patients. Mechanistic insights were extracted from studies on nutrient transport, immunometabolism, and microbiome-immune interactions, including data from ongoing nutritional clinical trials. <b>Results</b>: Diets rich in fermentable fibers, plant polyphenols, and unsaturated lipids, such as Mediterranean and ketogenic diets, seem to contribute to the reprogramming of tumor metabolism and enhance CD8+ T-cell activity. Fasting-mimicking and methionine-restricted diets modulate T-cell fitness and tumor vulnerability via nutrient stress sensors (e.g., UPR, mTOR). High fiber intake correlates with favorable gut microbiota and improved ICI efficacy, while excess protein, methionine, or refined carbohydrates impair immune surveillance via lactate accumulation and immunosuppressive myeloid recruitment. Several dietary molecules act as network-level modulators of host and microbial proteins, with parallels to known drug scaffolds. <b>Conclusions</b>: Integrating dietary interventions into melanoma immunotherapy can significantly influence metabolic reprogramming by targeting metabolic vulnerabilities and reshaping the tumor-immune-microbiome axis. When combined with AI-driven nutrient-protein interaction mapping, this approach offers a precision nutrition paradigm that supports both physicians and patients, emerging as a novel layer to enhance and consolidate existing therapeutic strategies.",Grafanaki K; Maniatis A; Anastogianni A; Bania A; Pasmatzi E; Stathopoulos C,Journal of clinical medicine,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40565936/,1,0,0,0,0,0

40553025,Mobile Apps to Prevent Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG): Systematic App Research and Content Analysis.,"Numerous reviews have explored specific aspects of violence prevention apps, but given the rapid development of new apps, increased violence during COVID-19, and gaps in understanding functionalities and geographical distribution, an updated review is needed. Therefore, we aimed to systematically evaluate the trends, geographical distribution, functional categories, available features, and feature evolution of mobile apps designed to prevent violence against women and girls (VAWG). We conducted a systematic search on app reselling platforms and search engines from April 24, 2024 to May 28, 2024, using terms related to VAWG in multiple languages. We included apps meeting our criteria for addressing VAWG, without restrictions on date or language. We conducted content analysis of app and apps were categorized by functionality and feature type. We performed descriptive analyses, trend analysis, co-occurrence network analysis, and geographical mapping. Out of 432 apps initially identified, 178 were included in the final analysis. Of these, 99 apps were available on both Google Play and the App Store, and 64 were exclusive to Google Play. Most apps were implemented in North America (48/178, 27%), followed by South Asia (31/178, 17%) and Europe and Central Asia (31/178, 17%). Emergency and support apps were most prevalent across regions. Most apps (132/178, 74%) originated from the private sector and were designed for survivor (121/178, 68%), were free without in-app purchases (100/178, 56%), had a website (148/178, 83%), and offered GPS features (142/178, 80%), but only 15% (27/178) provided offline functionality. App releases peaked in 2020 (33/178, 19%), followed by a decline. Regression analysis indicated a significant trend (P=.01) increase in app release, with a 2.40 unit increase per year before 2020 and a 7.01 unit decrease after, showing a post-2020 decline of 4.61 units per year. Apps were primarily categorized as emergency (n=110) or support (n=81), with most emergency apps in the 10,000 to ≥100,000 downloads range. Network analysis showed that emergency services (degree=10, clustering coefficient=0.911), location sharing (degree=10, clustering coefficient=0.911), SOS (Save Our Souls) alerts (degree=10, clustering coefficient=0.911), and educational resources (degree=10, clustering coefficient=0.911) features highly co-occurred in the same app. We found a gradual shift towards more sophisticated and comprehensive safety tools, evolving from basic GPS tracking and SOS alerts to advanced features such as real-time communication, panic buttons, peer support, and group communication, culminating in multifunctional platforms offering personalized safety, community engagement, and proactive risk identification. Most apps to prevent VAWG emphasize emergency and support functions, and although initial releases increased, there has been a recent decline, with a shift towards integrating more comprehensive safety solutions such as communication, reporting, and community engagement. Future app development should prioritize cross-platform availability, offline functionality, public sector collaboration, and the integration of advanced technologies like artificial intelligence.",Rahman MH; Usmani NG; Chandra P; Manna RM; Ahmed A; Shomik MS; Arifeen SE; Hossain AT; Rahman AE,JMIR formative research,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40553025/,0,1,0,0,0,0

40550108,Call to action-Pediatric MASLD requires immediate attention to curb health crisis.,"Pediatric metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has become more prevalent on a global scale over the last decades and is associated with significant comorbidities in childhood and a 40-fold higher risk of early mortality in young adulthood. MASLD has now become the leading indication for liver transplantation in young adults in the United States. However, pediatric MASLD is still perceived as an indolent condition by many patients, families, and clinicians. In this Call to Action, we aim to raise awareness of pediatric MASLD as a public health crisis. Herein, we describe insufficient screening and disease staging practices, and a lack of accurate non-invasive tests and effective pharmacotherapy, both stemming from a paucity of multicenter clinical trials in pediatric MASLD. We provide clear steps to address this public health emergency by promoting awareness campaigns, educating and empowering patients and families, addressing barriers including access to care, nutritional and exercise support programs, establishing multidisciplinary care, launching community initiatives, and conducting clinical trials in pediatric MASLD for an age-based evaluation of novel diagnostic and therapeutic options. We conclude by highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive public health policies to control the tide of pediatric MASLD and call upon stakeholders to act now.",Hartmann P; Mouzaki M; Hassan S; Kehar M; Mysore KR; Mauney E; Nonga D; Karjoo S; Sood S; Tou A; Brichta C; Herdes RE; Pai N; Garner DK; Rinella ME; Noureddin M; Younossi Z; Allen AM; Sanyal A; Kohut T; Kohli R; Ramirez CM; Xanthakos S; Vos MB; Schwimmer JB; Ibrahim SH; Panganiban J,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40550108/,1,0,0,0,0,0

These applications require the incorporation of data analytics in the form of chemometrics, machine learning and AI tools. This paper rather to provide with information about the advantages and opportunities of AI applications in the field of food sciences, it focusses on discussing the different issues that can conspire with the implementation and utilization of AI methods and techniques, in combination with sensing technologies and instrumental methods. The scientific literature has provided with a vast number of examples on the growing trend on the utilization of AI and ML methods and techniques, in food science applications. The incorporation of both AI, and ML methods has aided to the development of mathematical models that are helping to better explain not only food composition, but also the food system. However, no matter the type of AI and ML method or technique utilized, there are issues of importance that are not well understood or considered during their application. They can include among other issues, the selection of samples and sampling protocols, the lack of understanding of the physical effects of sample presentation on the collected signal, the utilization of few samples during model development, the issues associated with model overfitting as well as the lack of validation of the models.",Hoffman LC; Cozzolino D,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40544323/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40545546,Enablers and barriers to physical activity among older adults of low socio-economic status: a systematic review of qualitative literature.,"Understanding the factors influencing physical activity in older adults, and whether they vary according to socio-economic status (SES), could help to inform interventions that are effective in reducing inequalities and improving the quality of life of an ageing population. This systematic review aimed to synthesise the qualitative evidence on the modifiable enablers of, and barriers to, physical activity based on low-SES older adults' perspectives in the United Kingdom (UK). A secondary aim was to identify and summarise differences in physical activity enablers and barriers between older adults of low and high SES. We searched five electronic databases from inception to December 2023 for studies conducted among UK-based, community-dwelling older adults aged 60+ years including qualitative methods, with results reported by SES. We excluded hospitalised or institutionalised participants. Risk of bias was assessed with the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool, and framework synthesis was applied using the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and Behaviour (COM-B) model. Thirty studies were included in the review, of which five specifically examined inequalities in physical activity enablers and barriers. Low-SES older adults' physical capability was influenced by fitness, mobility, and general health, while their psychological capability was shaped by knowledge and behavioural regulation. Physical opportunity was characterised by safety, pedestrian infrastructure, access to physical activity opportunities and daily destinations, environmental quality, and aesthetics. Themes under social opportunity encompassed social support, social norms, social engagement, and dog ownership. Physical activity was motivated by reflective processes, such as outcome expectancies, self-efficacy, and attitudes, as well as automatic processes, including habits, lack of time, and enjoyment. Few studies investigated differences between participants of low and high SES, with those that did predominantly pointing to disparities in the physical or built environment. This meta-synthesis of qualitative literature identified a wide range of interacting factors influencing physical activity across socio-ecological and COM-B domains, underscoring whole-system interventions as a potential approach to stimulate meaningful and sustained change. Future research could report results by SES to enhance our understanding of inequalities and ensure that low-SES older adults are represented in the development and evaluation of interventions targeting improvements in physical activity.",Malkowski OS; Harvey J; Townsend NP; Kelson MJ; Foster CEM; Western MJ,The international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40545546/,0,1,0,0,0,0
40545526,Correlates and determinants of physical activity among older adults of lower versus higher socio-economic status: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Understanding socio-economic differences in the factors influencing physical activity among older adults is essential for developing comprehensive interventions. We aimed to quantify the associations of modifiable correlates and determinants on physical activity among older adults of lower versus higher socio-economic status in the United Kingdom. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Scopus from inception to December 2023, for peer-reviewed studies published in English, investigating associations between a modifiable factor as an independent variable and physical activity as a dependent variable, by socio-economic status (defined according to various area- and individual-level indicators, including neighbourhood deprivation, wealth or income, education, and occupational class), in samples of community-dwelling older adults aged 60+ years in the United Kingdom. Hospitalised and institutionalised populations were excluded. Random effects meta-analyses were performed separately for people of lower and higher socio-economic status. Risk of bias was assessed with the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. This study was registered with the International prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO; CRD42022351708). Searches identified 11,472 references; seventy-seven studies met the selection criteria, of which fifty-one contributed to meta-analyses (N range = 134-29,280). Of the exposures positively associated with physical activity, physical function, social participation, and perception of general health had the largest effect sizes (standardised mean difference [SMD] range = 0.53-0.81; I<sup>2</sup> range = 54.81-91.00%). Estimates were comparable among older adults of lower and higher socio-economic status, except for the presence of built physical activity facilities, access to walking and cycling infrastructure, and less smoking, which were positively associated with physical activity only among individuals of lower socio-economic status. Our results suggest researchers need to better understand discrepancies in the prevalence of the assessed correlates (e.g., fewer participants of lower socio-economic status reported good physical function) to inform policies that reduce inequalities in older adults' physical activity levels. However, most studies were cross-sectional. Future longitudinal and experimental research should gauge the suitability of these correlates as intervention targets.",Malkowski OS; Harvey J; Townsend NP; Kelson MJ; Foster CEM; Western MJ,The international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40545526/,0,1,0,1,0,1

This poses a barrier in clinical care and research. To perform a systematic review to examine existing definitions and diagnostic methods of detection regarding fibrostenosis in eosinophilic oesophagitis. We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science and included studies of paediatric and adult eosinophilic oesophagitis patients with fibrostenosis based on endoscopy, imaging, histopathology, functional studies, and biomarkers. We excluded studies with <10 patients. We chose fibrostenosis as the umbrella term, encompassing all definitions. We identified 230 studies. The four categories of fibrostenosis definitions were: (1) structural findings (stricture, rings, and/or narrowings) (n=204, 88.7%), (2) histology (n=85, 37.0%), (3) functional (functional lumen imaging probe) (n=15, 6.5%), and (4) biomarkers (n=7, 3.0%). Multiple definitions were used in 78 studies. Methods used to detect structural fibrostenosis included Eosinophilic Oesophagitis Endoscopic Reference Score fibrostenotic components, luminal diameter (endoscopy or imaging), need for dilation, and endoscopist or radiologist global impression. Methods used to detect histologic fibrostenosis included Eosinophilic Oesophagitis Histologic Scoring System lamina propria fibrosis, pathologist global impression, and basal zone hyperplasia. Methods used to detect functional fibrostenosis included distensibility and compliance. Significant variability exists in definitions and diagnostic methods of detection regarding fibrostenosis in eosinophilic oesophagitis.

Point-of-care technologies (POCTs) offer a transformative approach to decentralizing cancer diagnostics by providing rapid, affordable, and scalable testing in resource-constrained settings. Recent advancements, including loop-mediated isothermal amplification and multiplexed lateral flow immunoassay, enable high-sensitivity detection of cancer biomarkers without the need for complex laboratory infrastructure. Additionally, noninvasive imaging tools, such as optical coherence tomography and fluorescence-guided microscopy, offer portable and cost-effective solutions for early cancer detection in settings with limited health care services. These innovations are complemented by the integration of artificial intelligence, which improves diagnostic accuracy and reduces reliance on highly trained personnel. However, significant infrastructure and logistical challenges persist, including resource constraints, unreliable electricity, and insufficient cold-chain logistics, which limit diagnostic precision and accessibility. This review discusses recent advances in POCTs for oncology and examines how public-private partnerships and multisector collaborations can address key implementation barriers. By prioritizing inclusivity, cross-sector collaboration, and targeted investments, POCTs can sustainably narrow global disparities in cancer diagnosis and treatment.",Gao W; Manning JC; Devaraj K; Richards-Kortum RR; McFall SM; Murphy RL; Semeere A; Erickson D,JCO global oncology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40532137/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40528137,Immuno-nutritional therapy in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis: a translational pathway to multiple sclerosis management.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterised by myelin degeneration in the central nervous system (CNS), leading to significant neurological impairment. Affecting approximately 2.8 million people globally and has a multifactorial aetiology involving genetic predispositions and environmental factors, particularly dietary influences. This review explores the emerging field of immuno-nutritional therapy as a novel approach for managing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a widely accepted animal model of MS. We highlight the therapeutic potential of key nutritional components, such as omega-3 fatty acids, polyphenols, and vitamins A and D, which have been shown to modulate immune responses and promote neuroprotection. These nutrients exert their effects by regulating cytokine profiles, enhancing regulatory T-cell (Treg) differentiation, and maintaining blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Evidence suggests that dietary interventions can significantly modulate disease severity and progression in EAE, offering valuable insights into potential therapeutic strategies for MS patients. However, translating the findings from EAE models to human MS requires careful consideration of differences in immune responses and environmental factors. Future clinical trials designed to evaluate the long-term efficacy of dietary interventions across diverse MS populations are essential. By integrating immunomodulatory treatments with tailored nutritional strategies, there is a potential for innovative therapies that can alter disease trajectories and improve patient outcomes. A collaborative approach among nutrition scientists, immunologists, and neurologists could pave the way for effective immuno-nutritional therapies in MS management, enhancing the quality of life of those affected by this debilitating condition.",Aliyu M; Saboor-Yaraghi AA; Getso MI; Zohora FT,Inflammopharmacology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40528137/,1,0,0,0,0,0

This review highlights how patient heterogeneity affects trial outcomes and explores how artificial intelligence and machine learning can address this issue by identifying subgroups with distinct treatment responses, improving trial design, and enhancing the precision of nutritional interventions. RCTs estimate the average treatment effect, which can obscure heterogeneous treatment effects, where some patients benefit while others experience no effect or harm. Recent studies highlight that artificial intelligence techniques such as clustering, predictive modeling, causal artificial intelligence, and reinforcement learning have the potential to individualize treatments and decrease heterogeneity in trials. Digital twins and artificial intelligence-driven adaptive trial designs further enable personalized interventions, optimizing study populations and improving treatment precision. The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning into clinical trials offers a powerful strategy to refine patient selection, reduce variability, and enhance the detection of meaningful treatment effects. These advancements hold significant potential to transform critical care nutrition research, leading to more precise, personalized, and effective interventions.",Oh W; Veshtaj M; Sakhuja A,Current opinion in critical care,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40522118/,1,0,0,0,0,0

40500936,Advanced Oral Delivery Systems for Nutraceuticals.,"Oral delivery is the most preferred route for nutraceuticals due to its convenience and high patient compliance. However, bioavailability is often compromised by poor solubility, instability, and first-pass metabolism in the gastrointestinal tract. This review examines current and emerging oral delivery platforms designed to overcome these barriers and enhance nutraceutical efficacy. Traditional carriers-proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates-highlighting their delivery mechanisms and limitations, are first explored. Advancements in material science have led to novel platforms such as biodegradable polymers, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), metal-polyphenol networks (MPNs), and 3D printing technologies. Biodegradable polymers improve stability and enable controlled release of bioactives. MOFs offer high surface area and tunable porosity for encapsulating and protecting sensitive compounds. MPNs provide biocompatible, stimuli-responsive systems for targeted nutrient delivery. Meanwhile, 3D printing facilitates the fabrication of personalized delivery systems with precise control over composition and release kinetics, especially when integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) for precision nutrition. By comparing traditional and next-generation strategies, this review outlines key design principles for optimizing oral delivery systems.

40474554,Systematic Review: Use of Artificial Intelligence and Unmet Needs in Eosinophilic Oesophagitis.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied extensively to eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE), but its clinical impact and comprehensiveness remain unclear. To summarise the state of the art of applications of AI in EoE, identify gaps in the literature and disclose unmet needs. We performed a systematic review of applications of AI in diagnosis, prognosis, precision medicine and follow-up in EoE. We searched MEDLINE, Embase and Embase Classic (via Ovid) from inception until 28th February 2025. Clinical trials, cohort, case-control, cross-sectional and case series studies were eligible for inclusion. We identified 28 studies on AI in EoE, with 18 focusing on diagnosis. AI was used for histology image analysis in digital pathology in seven and endoscopic image analysis in three studies. AI-based non-invasive diagnostic predictive models showed high accuracy in detecting EoE. As a prognostic tool, AI showed potential in predicting food impaction, histologic disease severity and fibrosis. AI was used in precision medicine for biomarker discovery, endotype prediction based on transcriptomics and treatment personalisation, as well as in disease monitoring and follow-up. Unmet needs included insufficient studies on children/adolescents, prediction of treatment response and improvement of study designs. Although AI showed promise at improving EoE management across various domains, most tools require validation on larger, independent and prospective cohorts.

40462133,Exploring the association between computed tomography (CT)-derived skeletal muscle mass and short- and long-term mortality in critically ill patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Low skeletal mass, often present at hospital admission, has been associated with poor prognoses. To explore the association between computed tomography (CT)-derived skeletal muscle mass at the lumbar level and short- and long-term mortality in critically ill patients. Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we included studies on critically ill adults (≥ 18 years) hospitalized in intensive care units (ICU) that measured CT-derived skeletal muscle mass at the lumbar vertebral level within ± 7 days of ICU admission. The primary outcome was mortality, categorized as short-term (including ICU, hospital, 28- and 30-day mortality) and long-term (> 30 days) mortality. MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched without date restrictions. Study screening was performed using Rayyan, data extraction was guided by a custom-designed tool, and quality assessment was performed using the JBI Cohort Study Checklist. A meta-analysis was conducted, focusing on studies that reported short- and long-term mortality among patients with preserved and reduced skeletal muscle. A prevalence meta-analysis was also performed for studies that reported the size of subgroups with low muscle mass. Out of 1248 unique records, 35 studies met the inclusion criteria, involving 9366 participants. The majority were retrospective, single-centre studies conducted on four continents and included heterogeneous populations such as patients with sepsis, COVID-19 and trauma. Sample sizes ranged from 36 to 939, with a wide age range, from 40 to 70 s, and a predominance of male patients (62%). Skeletal mass was most commonly reported as skeletal muscle index at the third lumbar vertebra. Studies reported mainly short-term mortality on day 28 or 30. Long-term mortality, measured at 90 days, 6 months, and 1 year, was evaluated in 11 studies. Meta-analyses revealed that low skeletal muscle mass area and index were significantly associated with increased risks of both short (OR = 2.33, CI 1.90-2.87, I<sup>2</sup> = 41.39%)-and long-term mortality (OR = 2.67, CI 1.45-4.92, I<sup>2</sup> = 62.24%).

40431399,Personalized Nutrition Strategies for Patients in the Intensive Care Unit: A Narrative Review on the Future of Critical Care Nutrition.,"<b>Introduction:</b> Critically ill patients in intensive care units (ICUs) are at high risk of malnutrition, which can result in muscle atrophy, polyneuropathy, increased mortality, or prolonged hospitalizations with complications and higher costs during the recovery period. They often develop ICU-acquired weakness, exacerbated by sepsis, immobilization, and drug treatments, leading to rapid muscle mass loss and long-term complications. Studies indicate that adequate protein and calorie intake can decrease mortality and improve prognosis and recovery. However, optimal implementation remains a critical challenge. <b>Objectives:</b> This narrative review aims to summarize recent advances in nutritional strategies for critically ill patients. It highlights the benefits and limitations of current approaches including enteral (EN) and parenteral nutrition (PN) and examines their impact on clinical outcomes and overall mortality. Additionally, the review explores the emerging role of precision nutrition in critical care using technologies such as metabolomics and artificial intelligence (AI) to provide valuable insights into optimizing nutritional care in critically ill patients. <b>Methods:</b> A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify recent studies, clinical guidelines, and expert consensus papers on nutritional support for ICU patients. The investigation focused on critical aspects such as the optimal timing for intervention, the route of administration, specific protein and energy targets, and technological innovations to support personalized nutrition, ensuring that each patient receives tailored support based on their unique needs. <b>Results:</b> Guidelines recommend initiating EN or PN nutrition within the first 48 h of admission, using indirect calorimetry (IC) to estimate energy needs, and supplementing protein up to 1.2 g/kg/day after stabilization. IC has gained importance in assessing energy needs but is still underused in the ICU. EN is preferred because it maintains intestinal integrity, reduces the risk of infections, and is recommended within the first 48 h of ICU admission. PN is used when EN is infeasible, but it increases the risk of infection. By integrating metabolomics with transcriptomic and genomic data, we can gain a deeper understanding of the effect of nutrition on cellular homeostasis, facilitating personalized treatments and enhancing the recovery of critically ill patients. <b>Conclusions:</b> AI is becoming increasingly important in monitoring and evaluating artificial nutrition, providing a more accurate and efficient alternative to traditional methods. AI can assist in identifying and managing malnutrition and is effective for estimating caloric and nutrient intake. AI minimizes human error, enables continuous monitoring, and integrates various data sources.

40308291,Consumer-oriented review of digital diabetes prevention programs: insights from the CDC's diabetes prevention recognition program.,"Prediabetes is highly prevalent and significantly increases the risk of type 2 diabetes. While access to proven interventions like the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) has historically been limited, digital DPPs (dDPPs) present a promising and scalable option. With the recent growth of dDPP offerings and potential variability across platforms, access to accurate and clear information is crucial for individuals seeking diabetes prevention options. This review provides an overview of the dDPP landscape and characterizes the ""direct-to-consumer"" information available-or lacking-for patients choosing a dDPP. We identified dDPPs through the CDC Diabetes Prevention Recognition Program (DPRP) Registry. Data were extracted from three sources available to consumers: the CDC DPRP Registry, the CDC ""Find a Lifestyle Program"" Website, and program-specific websites. Extracted data included CDC recognition status, intended audience, available languages, program features (e.g., artificial intelligence, integration with smart devices), website availability and functionality, demonstrations of credibility (e.g., ADA endorsement), clinical performance metrics (e.g., average weight loss), and user experience factors (e.g., satisfaction). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize extracted data. A total of 97 dDPPs were included in the review, with most in the early stages of CDC recognition. Only 35% of dDPPs listed in the CDC registry had functional websites, though additional websites were identified through manual searches. Program-specific features included AI-driven health recommendations, device integration (e.g., digital scales and activity trackers), nutrition tracking tools, and telehealth platforms. Nearly half of the dDPPs reported clinical performance metrics such as weight loss and A1C outcomes. User experience details were often presented through patient testimonials and satisfaction scores. Notably, many programs required users to provide personal information to access additional information. We found that available dDPPs vary significantly in their features, designs, and structures, reflecting a diverse and evolving landscape of diabetes prevention options. Concurrently, many dDPPs lack accessible information due to missing or incomplete websites. Centralized sources of information provided by the CDC are also insufficient, with discrepancies and gaps that hinder transparency and consumer decision-making. Addressing these issues through enhanced program visibility and improved centralized databases will be critical to optimizing the reach and impact of dDPPs.",Lalani B; Shim J; Vadini V; Valdez Y; Zade D; Mathioudakis N,Frontiers in clinical diabetes and healthcare,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40308291/,1,0,0,0,0,0

40247006,Patterns of pathogenesis in innate immunity: insights from C. elegans.,"The cells in barrier tissues can distinguish pathogenic from commensal bacteria and target inflammatory responses only in the context of infection. As such, these cells must be able to identify pathogen infection specifically and not just the presence of an infectious organism, because many innocuous bacteria express the ligands that activate innate immunity in other contexts. Unravelling the mechanisms that underly this specificity, however, is challenging. Free-living nematodes, such as Caenorhabditis elegans, are faced with a similar dilemma, as they live in microorganism-rich habitats and eat bacteria as their source of nutrition. Nematodes lost canonical mechanisms of pattern recognition during their evolution and have instead evolved mechanisms to identify specific ligands or symptoms in the host that indicate active infection with an infectious microorganism. Here we review how C. elegans surveys for these patterns of pathogenesis to activate innate immune defences. Collectively, this work demonstrates that using C. elegans as an experimental platform to study host-pathogen interactions at barrier surfaces reveals primordial and fundamentally important principles of innate immune sensing in the animal branch of the tree of life.",Tse-Kang S; Wani KA; Pukkila-Worley R,Nature reviews.

40240062,Cellular and molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of pouchitis: more than just the microbiota.,"Pouchitis, defined as inflammation of the ileal pouch, is the most common complication following restorative proctocolectomy for refractory ulcerative colitis. Antibiotics remain the first line of therapy for pouchitis, but the majority of patients develop subsequent episodes and some are refractory to antibiotic therapy. This highlights the need for more effective treatment options and points to a more complex pathophysiology beyond the role of th pouch microbiome, similar to what is seen in inflammatory bowel disease. In this review, we outline the putative mechanisms of pouchitis, including genetic predisposition, microbiome alterations, dysfunction of the intestinal barrier and the immune system and review the available animal models of pouchitis. In addition, we introduce the concept of pouchitis as a possible transmural disease and discuss the potential role of non-immune cells, including stromal cells, in perpetuating inflammation and intestinal barrier dysfunction.

40214179,Effects of Whole-Body Vibration Therapy on Physical Function in Children With Cerebral Palsy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials.,"Although whole-body vibration (WBV) is often employed alongside traditional physical therapies to treat cerebral palsy, its effects on motor function remain unclear. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of WBV either alone or in combination with other therapies in children with cerebral palsy, compared with control groups that underwent traditional physical therapy or remained untreated. We analyzed randomized controlled trials published up to September 2024 that assessed motor function in WBV and control groups, including those receiving conventional physical therapy or no intervention. Articles were retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library. The random-effects model was used to analyze the outcomes of these trials. Our search yielded 23 studies involving 729 participants. Compared with the control group, the WBV group exhibited significantly greater improvements in walking speed (pooled mean difference: 14.26 cm/s [95% CI = 6.45 to 22.08 cm/s]), Timed ""Up & Go"" test (TUG) results (pooled mean difference = -2.52 seconds [95% CI = -3.66 to -1.37 seconds]), Gross Motor Function Measure scores (total score: pooled mean difference = 0.69 [95% CI = 0.30 to 1.08]; dimension D: pooled mean difference = 3.41 [95% CI = 0.53 to 6.29]; dimension E: pooled mean difference = 3.28 [95% CI = 1.36 to 5.20]), and overall stability index values (standardized mean difference = -1.20 [95% CI = -2.28 to -0.11]). The Modified Ashworth Scale results varied between the muscle groups, and no intolerable adverse effects of WBV were reported. WBV improves postural control and motor performance in children with cerebral palsy by enhancing walking speed, TUG performance, and gross motor function without causing intolerable adverse effects. However, the certainty of the current evidence on the topic is very low or low. Additional well-structured trials are required to determine the optimal intensity of WBV treatment. Given its therapeutic benefits and safety, WBV may be considered as an adjunctive therapy for managing cerebral palsy, particularly for children with spastic cerebral palsy.",Huang CH; Chen CY; Lin HW; Chiu YF; Lin LF; Tam KW; Lu TW; Chiang SW; Kuan YC,Physical therapy,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40214179/,0,1,0,1,0,0

40202855,AI in Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy: Review.,"Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality worldwide. Early detection and risk stratification are critical for timely intervention to prevent severe complications such as eclampsia, stroke, and preterm delivery. However, traditional clinical methods often lack the precision needed to identify high-risk individuals effectively. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool, leveraging complex data to enhance prediction, diagnosis, and clinical decision-making in HDP. This review aims to systematically evaluate ML applications in HDP, highlighting trends, methodologies, and gaps to guide future research and improve maternal and fetal outcomes. This study adheres to the PRISMA-ScR guidelines for scoping reviews, focusing on full-text, English-language publications that apply ML models to HDP. A comprehensive search across three databases captured studies involving at-risk patient populations. Data extraction followed the CHARMS checklist, summarizing study characteristics, outcomes, and ML methodologies, while also identifying gaps and opportunities for further research. Most studies targeted preeclampsia (n = 70, 75.27%), with limited focus on other HDP phenotypes such as gestational hypertension (n = 4, 4.3%) and postpartum hypertension (n = 1, 1.07%). Sample sizes ranged from 20 to over 700,000 participants. Studies have been increasing since 2014 emphasizing diagnosis/onset detection (n = 58, 62.37%) and risk prediction (n = 26, 27.95%). Random forest, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines were the most common ML methods. Geographic analysis revealed concentration in China (n = 29, 31.18%) and North America (n = 18, 19.35%), with underrepresentation in other regions. Input data predominantly comprised demographics (n = 50, 53.76%), patient/family history (n = 43, 46.24%), and functional tests (n = 43, 46.24%), whereas omics (n = 29, 31.18%) and imaging data (n = 2, 2.15%) were infrequently used. Outcomes related to time-to-intervenes and readmission were each reported once. ML is increasingly applied to HDP, with significant growth in diagnostic and risk prediction models. However, geographic disparities, limited phenotype representation, and models to help intervene at critical time points throughout the perinatal lifecycle remain barriers. Notably, models addressing time-to-intervene predictions and hospital readmissions are underrepresented, highlighting critical gaps in the current literature. Addressing these limitations-by developing models to help improve the timing of medical interventions, higher risk profiling, and diverse datasets-can advance ML's role in improving maternal and fetal outcomes and reducing mortality globally. Future research should focus on refining ML models to support clinicians and advance care for patients with HDP.",Zapata RD; Tolani T; Reich R; Beneteau S; Ali H; Kolli T; Rechdan M; Brinkley L; Himadi M; Louis-Jacques A; Modave F; Smith SM; Wen T; Shenkman E; Lemas DJ,American journal of hypertension,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40202855/,1,0,0,0,0,0

40183602,Megatrends and emerging issues: Impacts on food safety.,"The world is changing at a pace, driven by global megatrends and their interactions. Megatrends, including climate change, the drive for sustainability, an aging population, urbanization, and geopolitical tensions, are producing an increasingly challenging environment for the provision of a safe and secure food supply. To ensure a robust, safe, and secure food supply for all, potential food safety impacts associated with these megatrends need to be understood, and mitigation and management plans must be implemented. This paper outlines the relevant megatrends, discusses their potential impact on food safety, and suggests steps to help ensure the production of safe food in the future. Megatrends are increasingly driving resource depletion, reducing the vitality of plants and animals, increasing the geographical spread of animal and plant pathogens, increasing the risk of mycotoxins, agrichemical residues, and antimicrobial-resistant pathogens contaminating foods, and threatening to destabilize food systems and the food regulatory network. Science-based actions, adopting continual and dynamic risk assessments, alongside the use of more sensitive and accurate methods for the detection of contaminants, may counter these challenges. The use of artificial intelligence, robotics and automation, the enhancement of food safety cultures, the continued education and training of workforces, and the implementation of risk-based food regulations will help ensure preventative controls are in place. As low-income countries and smallholder farmers are more likely to be exposed to the impact of these megatrends and less likely to have resources to counter them, geographical social inequality, unrest, and population migration are likely to be exacerbated unless urgent action is taken.",Thorsen M; Hill J; Farber J; Yiannas F; Rietjens IMCM; Venter P; Lues R; Bremer P,Comprehensive reviews in food science and food safety,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40183602/,1,0,0,0,0,0

40164953,Personalized Nutrition for the Enhancement of Elite Athletic Performance.,"Enhancing athletic performance through the manipulation of nutritional intake has ancient roots, with early guidance from ""philosophical giants"" like Hippocrates, who describes the balance between diet and exercise. Modern sports nutrition emerged in the 20th century, with research identifying carbohydrate (CHO) intake as beneficial for endurance. Studies like Gordon's in the 1920s linked blood glucose levels to marathon performance, while Cade's research in the 1960s on fluid and electrolyte intake led to the founding of Gatorade and the shift toward drinking during exercise to allegedly prevent dehydration and improve sporting performance. Today, sports nutrition is in a ""holding pattern"" after significant developments in the 1980s, 1990s, and the 2000s. A new era will involve personalized nutrition, but this development will require a game-changing injection of momentum, recognizing that athletes' responses to nutrition interventions vary widely. New technologies will also need to be developed and perfected, including wearables for real-time biometric monitoring (e.g., heart rate variability, glucose, and sweat composition and rate), which offer potential for tailored nutrition (i.e., diet and hydration) strategies. Applications of genetic and multi-omics technologies (like genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, and epigenomics) are needed to unlock the potential of personalized sports nutrition by analyzing individual responses to factors such as sleep, nutrition, and exercise.

40163131,A consensus of European experts on the definition of ventilator-associated pneumonia recurrences obtained by the Delphi method: the RECUVAP study.,"There are recognized diagnostic criteria for a first ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) episode, but not for recurrences. Many randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have used the recurrence of VAP as a criterion for efficacy evaluation. Still, the different definitions used in RCTs make it difficult to compare studies. We aimed to develop a consensual definition of VAP recurrences and of the various types of VAP recurrences. Thirty-six European experts constituting a multidisciplinary group of physicians (critical care, infectious diseases, microbiology) with special interest in the management of VAP were polled using the Delphi methodology. After the completion of four iterations of the DELPHI method, 94% of experts agreed that the diagnostic criteria for a first VAP episode could also be used for recurrences, except for the radiological criterion, which not all the experts considered to be mandatory. Consensus was also reached regarding the definition of four distinct entities: relapse, persistent VAP, superinfection, and new-pathogen VAP. For relapse and persistent VAP, bacteriological findings were identical for different VAP episodes, whereas they differed for superinfection and new-pathogen VAP. The distinction between relapse and persistent VAP, and between superinfection and new-pathogen VAP depended on the timing of antibiotic treatment (before or after 48-72 h after the end of antibiotic therapy) and the clinical course. Microbiological criteria were proposed to facilitate the diagnosis of persistent VAP. This consensus by European experts proposes four different VAP recurrence entities which should facilitate the harmonization of recurrence criteria for clinical practice and future studies.",Gaillet A; Luyt CE; Timsit JF; Asehnoune K; Barbier F; Bassetti M; Bouadma L; Bouglé A; Chastre J; Morris AC; De Waele JJ; Dépret F; Dimopoulos G; Ehrmann S; Ewig S; Fartoukh M; Foucrier A; Garnacho-Montero J; Hraiech S; Leone M; Makris D; Martin-Loeches I; Matthaiou D; Monsel A; Montravers P; Nseir S; Paiva JA; Papazian L; Poulakou G; Póvoa P; Pugin J; Rodriguez AH; Roquilly A; Roux D; Rouzé A; Taccone FS; Torres A; Zahar JR; Weiss E; Razazi K,Intensive care medicine,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40163131/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40161281,Lifestyle Interventions and Innovative Approaches for the Management of Neurodegenerative Disorders in Older Adults-State-Of-The-Art and Future Directions.,"Aging increases the risk of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) like Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD), characterized by neuronal loss and cognitive decline. Potential preventive/therapeutic interventions also include lifestyle changes like nutrition & diet, exercise, leisure and social engagement. Here, we discuss several lifestyle interventions for healthy brain aging, and in older adults with NDs. Balanced diets like the Mediterranean and MIND diets can reduce cognitive decline during aging. Long-term use of specific nutrient combinations in medical food may also exert benefits on memory. Metabolic interventions like calorie restriction (CR) and intermittent fasting (IF) have shown potential benefits in aging. However, their effects on cognitive function in older adults were modestly explored and remain unclear. Clinical trials are ongoing to test the cognitive and health outcomes of CR/IF variants in older adults with AD or PD (associated or not with metabolic disorders). We also highlight the role of cognitive reserve (CoR) in delaying dementia symptoms. Engaging in diverse leisure activities like music and bilingualism may enhance CoR and reduce AD risk. Finally, we outline future directions for promoting healthy brain aging through lifestyle interventions (e.g., personalized diets, precision nutrition, synergistic lifestyle approaches, AI-based technologies to monitor the effectiveness of lifestyle practices).",Popescu I; Lenain M; Rovini E; Ruthsatz M,American journal of lifestyle medicine,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40161281/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40152752,The impact of mild autonomous cortisol secretion and proposed interventions.,"Mild autonomous cortisol secretion (MACS) is the most common hormonal alteration in patients with adrenal incidentalomas (AIs). Given its prevalence and associated adverse outcomes, reviewing its impact and interventions is essential. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review on the diagnosis of MACS, the cardiometabolic burden associated with MACS and on its surgical and medical treatment. The diagnosis of MACS requires three criteria: hormonal evidence of hypercortisolism, the absence of typical Cushing's syndrome signs, and the presence of an AI. The most recommended test for MACS diagnosis is the 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test. There is plenty of evidence of the detrimental effect of MACS, including an increased risk of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia and all-cause mortality. Surgery should be considered for patients with significant comorbidities and has been shown to significantly improve anthropometric variables, hyperglycemia and blood pressure. Medical therapy to lower cortisol offers an effective alternative, particularly for patients with bilateral AI, when surgery is contraindicated, or the patient declines surgery. Based on our expert opinion, steroid profiling has the potential to become the gold standard for MACS diagnosis, and further studies should identify which patients benefit most from specific treatment to guiding evidence-based recommendations.",Iriarte-Durán MB; Donato S; Herrera A; Vega A; Jiménez Casinello JM; Marazuela M; Araujo-Castro M,Expert review of endocrinology & metabolism,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40152752/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40149547,Beyond the Surface: Nutritional Interventions Integrated with Diagnostic Imaging Tools to Target and Preserve Cartilage Integrity: A Narrative Review.,"This narrative review provides an overview of the various diagnostic tools used to assess cartilage health, with a focus on early detection, nutrition intervention, and management of osteoarthritis. Early detection of cartilage damage is crucial for effective patient management. Traditional diagnostic tools like radiography and conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences are more suited to detecting late-stage structural changes. This paper highlights advanced imaging techniques, including sodium MRI, T2 mapping, T1ρ imaging, and delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI of cartilage, which provide valuable biochemical information about cartilage composition, particularly the glycosaminoglycan content and its potential links to nutrition-related factors influencing cartilage health. Cartilage degradation is often linked with inflammation and measurable via markers like CRP and IL-6 which, although not specific to cartilage breakdown, offer insights into the inflammation affecting cartilage. In addition to imaging techniques, biochemical markers, such as collagen breakdown products and aggrecan fragments, which reflect metabolic changes in cartilage, are discussed. Emerging tools like optical coherence tomography and hybrid positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging (PET-MRI) are also explored, offering high-resolution imaging and combined metabolic and structural insights, respectively. Finally, wearable technology and biosensors for real-time monitoring of osteoarthritis progression, as well as the role of artificial intelligence in enhancing diagnostic accuracy through pattern recognition in imaging data are addressed. While these advanced diagnostic tools hold great potential for early detection and monitoring of osteoarthritis, challenges remain in clinical translation, including validation in larger populations and integration into existing clinical workflows and personalized treatment strategies for cartilage-related diseases.",Lavalle S; Scapaticci R; Masiello E; Salerno VM; Cuocolo R; Cannella R; Botteghi M; Orro A; Saggini R; Donati Zeppa S; Bartolacci A; Stocchi V; Piccoli G; Pegreffi F,Biomedicines,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40149547/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40147837,Computer aided detection and diagnosis of polyps in adult patients undergoing colonoscopy: a living clinical practice guideline.,"In adult patients undergoing colonoscopy for any indication (screening, surveillance, follow-up of positive faecal immunochemical testing, or gastrointestinal symptoms such as blood in the stools) what are the benefits and harms of computer-aided detection (CADe)? Colorectal cancer (CRC), the third most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death globally, typically arises from adenomatous polyps. Detection and removal of polyps during colonoscopy can reduce the risk of cancer. CADe systems use artificial intelligence (AI) to assist endoscopists by analysing real-time colonoscopy images to detect potential polyps. Despite their increasing use in clinical practice, guideline recommendations that carefully balance all patient-important outcomes remain unavailable. In this first iteration of a living guideline, we address the use of CADe at the level of an individual patient. Evidence for this recommendation is drawn from a living systematic review of 44 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving more than 30 000 participants and a companion microsimulation study simulating 10 year follow-up for 100 000 individuals aged 60-69 years to assess the impact of CADe on patient-important outcomes. While no direct evidence was found for critical outcomes of colorectal cancer incidence and post-colonoscopy cancer incidence, low certainty data from the trials indicate that CADe may increase positive endoscopy findings. The microsimulation modelling, however, suggests little to no effect on CRC incidence, CRC-related mortality, or colonoscopy-related complications (perforation and bleeding) over the 10 year follow-up period, although low certainty evidence indicates CADe may increase the number of colonoscopies performed per patient. A review of values and preferences identified that patients value mortality reduction and quality of care but worry about increased anxiety, overdiagnosis, and more frequent surveillance. For adults who have agreed to undergo colonoscopy, we suggest against the routine use of CADe (weak recommendation). An international panel, including three patient partners, 11 healthcare providers, and seven methodologists, deemed by MAGIC and <i>The BMJ</i> to have no relevant competing interests, developed this recommendation. For this guideline the panel took an individual patient approach. The panel started by defining the clinical question in PICO format, and prioritised outcomes including CRC incidence and mortality. Based on the linked systematic review and microsimulation study, the panel sought to balance the benefits, harms, and burdens of CADe and assumed patient preferences when making this recommendation UNDERSTANDING THE RECOMMENDATION: The guideline panel found the benefits of CADe on critical outcomes, such as CRC incidence and post-colonoscopy cancer incidence, over a 10 year follow up period to be highly uncertain. Low certainty evidence suggests little to no impact on CRC-related mortality, while the potential burdens-including more frequent surveillance colonoscopies-are likely to affect many patients. Given the small and uncertain benefits and the likelihood of burdens, the panel issued a weak recommendation against routine CADe use.The panel acknowledges the anticipated variability in values and preferences among patients and clinicians when considering these uncertain benefits and potential burdens. In healthcare settings where CADe is available, individual decision making may be appropriate. This is the first iteration of a living practice guideline. The panel will update this living guideline if ongoing evidence surveillance identifies new CADe trial data that substantially alters our conclusions about CRC incidence, mortality, or burdens, or studies that increase our certainty in values and preferences of individual patients. Updates will provide recommendations on the use of CADe from a healthcare systems perspective (including resource use, acceptability, feasibility, and equity), as well as the combined use of CADe and computer aided diagnosis (CADx). Users can access the latest guideline version and supporting evidence on MAGICapp, with updates periodically published in <i>The BMJ</i>.",Foroutan F; Vandvik PO; Helsingen LM; Kalager M; Rutter M; Selby K; Pilonis ND; Anderson JC; McKinnon A; Fuchs JM; Quinlan C; Buskermolen M; Senore C; Wang P; Sung JJY; Haug U; Bjerkelund S; Triantafyllou K; Shung DL; Halvorsen N; McGinn T; Hafver TL; Reinthaler V; Guyatt G; Agoritsas T; Sultan S,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40147837/,0,0,0,0,0,1
40144276,"Deep enteroscopy in children: techniques, applications, and future directions.","Deep enteroscopy, encompassing push enteroscopy (PE) and balloon-assisted enteroscopy (BAE), has revolutionized the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric small bowel disorders. This review examines the evolving role of these techniques in managing conditions such as obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, Crohn's disease, polyposis syndromes, strictures, and small bowel tumors. While PE is effective for both diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in the proximal small bowel, its limited insertion depth has driven the adoption of BAE techniques. These include single-balloon enteroscopy (SBE) and double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE), which provide deeper and more comprehensive access. Both BAE modalities offer greater insertion depth and stability, enabling advanced therapeutic interventions such as polypectomy, stricture dilation, and hemostasis. Pediatric-specific data demonstrate high diagnostic yields for BAE, with comparable outcomes between SBE and DBE. These techniques have proven safe across diverse indications, though younger children may experience slightly higher complication rates due to anatomical considerations. Despite these advancements, challenges persist, including a limited evidence base in pediatrics, barriers to training, and the need for standardized protocols. Additionally, emerging innovations such as artificial intelligence offer opportunities to enhance diagnostic accuracy and procedural efficiency. Comparative analyses of PE, BAE, and capsule endoscopy are necessary to refine procedural selection and optimize outcomes in pediatric patients. Furthermore, structured pediatric training programs and simulation-based learning could address competency gaps, ensuring safe and effective application of these techniques. By addressing current research gaps, embracing technological advancements, and tailoring approaches to pediatric populations, deep enteroscopy can continue to transform the management of small bowel disorders in children.",Hoskins BJ,Frontiers in pediatrics,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40144276/,1,0,0,0,0,0

It is characterized by enteropathy leading to both gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms. The prevalence of CeD has increased world-wide. Evidence suggests that genetic predisposition and exposure to gluten are necessary but not sufficient for CeD onset, implying that other unknown factors are at play in its pathogenesis. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the contribution of the gut microbiota to CeD pathogenesis, aiming to address the question of whether it is the cause or consequence of the celiac enteropathy. We reviewed the current literature (studies published in PubMed database between 2007 and 2023), linking gut microbiota dysbiosis and CeD, focusing specifically on prospective birth cohorts' studies and discussing how multi-omics and artificial intelligence (AI) could transform the diagnosis of CeD in a personalized medicine approach. A multi-omic approach will allow for better clarification of the pivotal role of the microbiome in epigenetically triggering CeD pathogenesis.

Smartphones are ideal for gathering data easily, providing quick feedback on diagnoses, and proposing interventions for health improvement. We reviewed the existing literature to gather studies that have used machine learning models with smartphone-derived data for the prediction and diagnosis of health anomalies. We divided the studies into those that used machine learning models by conducting experiments to retrieve data and predict diseases, and those that used machine learning models on publicly available databases. The details of databases, experiments, and machine learning models are intended to help researchers working in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence in the health care domain. Researchers can use the information to design their experiments or determine the databases they could analyze. A comprehensive search of the PubMed and IEEE Xplore databases was conducted, and an in-house keyword screening method was used to filter the articles based on the content of their titles and abstracts. Subsequently, studies related to the 3 areas of voice, skin, and eye were selected and analyzed based on how data for machine learning models were extracted (ie, the use of publicly available databases or through experiments). The machine learning methods used in each study were also noted. A total of 49 studies were identified as being relevant to the topic of interest, and among these studies, there were 31 different databases and 24 different machine learning methods. The results provide a better understanding of how smartphone data are collected for predicting different diseases and what kinds of machine learning methods are used on these data. Similarly, publicly available databases having smartphone-based data that can be used for the diagnosis of various diseases have been presented.

40121061,AGA Living Clinical Practice Guideline on Computer-Aided Detection-Assisted Colonoscopy.,"This American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guideline is intended to provide an overview of the evidence and support endoscopists and patients on the use of computer-aided detection (CADe) systems for the detection of colorectal polyps during colonoscopy. A multidisciplinary panel of content experts and guideline methodologists used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework and relied on the following sources of evidence: (1) a systematic review examining the desirable and undesirable effects (ie, benefits and harms) of CADe-assisted colonoscopy, (2) a microsimulation study estimating the effects of CADe on longer-term patient-important outcomes, (3) a systematic search of evidence evaluating the values and preferences of patients undergoing colonoscopy, and (4) a systematic review of studies evaluating health care providers' trust in artificial intelligence technology in gastroenterology. The panel reached the conclusion that no recommendation could be made for or against the use of CADe-assisted colonoscopy in light of very low certainty of evidence for the critical outcomes, desirable and undesirable (11 fewer colorectal cancers per 10,000 individuals and 2 fewer colorectal cancer deaths per 10,000 individuals), increased burden of more intensive surveillance colonoscopies (635 more per 10,000 individuals), and cost and resource implications. The panel acknowledged the 8% (95% CI, 6%-10%) increase in adenoma detection rate and 2% (95% CI, 0%-4%) increase in advanced adenoma and/or sessile serrated lesion detection rate.

In this Health Policy, we propose a comprehensive roadmap for integrating nutritional assessment, counselling, and support into tuberculosis treatment as part of person-centred care. At treatment initiation, we recommend standard nutritional assessment with anthropometric measurements and haemoglobin estimation, in addition to macronutrient and micronutrient support alongside nutritional counselling. Weight should be monitored during treatment and lack of weight gain at the end of the intensive phase should prompt an investigation of causes, such as food insecurity, poor treatment adherence, malabsorption, uncontrolled diabetes, or drug resistance. At the end of treatment, we recommend reassessing anthropometric measures to assess nutritional recovery. People with tuberculosis who remain underweight should receive close follow-up to detect early relapse.

These secreted factors integrate signals of metabolic status at both the cellular and systemic level, regulate the intake and distribution of ingested and stored energy substrates across tissues, and minimize toxicity from excessive excursions in circulating concentrations of energy substrates (for example, glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity). The proteins and peptides that are known to be secreted into circulation that are involved in regulating metabolic processes represent a fraction of the secretome predicted by the Human Proteome Atlas. Many undiscovered leads for targeting new therapies for metabolic diseases may therefore exist. In this review, we discuss the biology of adropin, the peptide encoded by the Energy Homeostasis Associated (ENHO) gene. First described as a feeding-responsive, liver-secreted peptide (""hepatokine"") involved in metabolic homeostasis, > 2 decades of research indicate adropin is a stress-responsive peptide acting across multiple tissues, vascular, and organ systems. Adropin modulates the responses of liver and muscle to insulin and glucagon in regulating glucose homeostasis. Adropin inhibits hepatic glucose production and stimulates glycolysis but also inhibits tissue fibrosis and maintains vascular health in aging and metabolic disease states. Adropin is also highly expressed in the central nervous system where recent data suggest neuroprotective actions.

40086468,"The intestinal barrier: a pivotal role in health, inflammation, and cancer.","The intestinal barrier serves as a boundary between the mucosal immune system in the lamina propria and the external environment of the intestinal lumen, which contains a diverse array of microorganisms and ingested environmental factors, including pathogens, food antigens, toxins, and other foreign substances. This barrier has a central role in regulating the controlled interaction between luminal factors and the intestinal immune system. Disruptions of intestinal epithelial cells, which serve as a physical barrier, or the antimicrobial peptides and mucins they produce, which act as a chemical barrier, can lead to a leaky gut. In this state, the intestinal wall is unable to efficiently separate the intestinal flora and luminal contents from the intestinal immune system. The subsequent activation of the immune system has an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, as well as in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and colorectal cancer. Dysregulated intestinal barrier integrity has also been described in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases outside the gastrointestinal tract, including rheumatoid arthritis and neurodegenerative disorders. Mechanistic studies of barrier dysfunction have revealed that the subsequent local activation and systemic circulation of activated immune cells and the cytokines they secrete, as well as extracellular vesicles, promote proinflammatory processes within and outside the gastrointestinal tract.

Timely enteral nutrition is essential for recovery. This study systematically reviews and analyzes the incidence and predictors of enteral nutrition intolerance (ENI) in AP patients. <b>Methods:</b> Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, and PubMed were searched up to May 2024. Studies reporting on ENI incidence and predictors in AP patients were included based on predefined criteria. Bias was assessed using standardized tools, and meta-analyses provided summary estimates with confidence intervals. <b>Results:</b> From the 2697 screened studies, 28 involving 4853 patients met the inclusion criteria. The pooled incidence of ENI was 26%. Significant predictors included comorbid diabetes, pancreatic necrosis, elevated pre-refeeding serum lipase levels, peri-pancreatic fluid collections, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome at admission. Higher ENI rates were observed in Europe, among patients with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), those receiving nasoenteric feeding, and in prospective study cohorts. <b>Conclusions:</b> ENI affects approximately one-quarter of AP patients and is not significantly associated with age, sex, or the cause of AP. Its incidence varies by region, disease severity, feeding method and study design.

Total parenteral nutrition has attracted great interest, and its adaptation to the patient's needs is a topic of interest in the scientific community. However, there are problems related to shortages in the supply of the concentrates required to balance TPN mixtures and to infections linked to the venous access devices that are necessary for administering nutrition. Adjusting the TPN composition to meet specific patient needs requires specialist knowledge, as the ingredients available on the market differ in terms of excipients and this may increase the risk of physicochemical incompatibilities, particularly the destabilization of the lipid fraction. It is common clinical practice to inject drugs into the parenteral nutrition bag, and hence there is a high demand for confirmation of the compatibility of a given drug with the TPN composition. However, methods used in clinical practice still differ from the modern solutions proposed in scientific research. In order to ensure patient safety with the use of advanced therapy, continuous education and monitoring of the latest scientific research related to TPN is required. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into clinical nutrition represents a paradigm shift in the management of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). As TPN transitions from a standardized, one-size-fits-all approach to a highly personalized therapy, we must examine the challenges and future directions of AI-driven TPN to provide a comprehensive analysis of its impact on clinical practice.",Sobol Ż; Chiczewski R; Wątróbska-Świetlikowska D,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40077716/,1,0,0,0,0,0

40066572,[Generative artificial intelligence ChatGPT in clinical nutrition - Advances and challenges].,"ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence (AI) tools can modify nutritional management in clinical settings. These technologies, based on machine learning and deep learning, enable the identification of risks, the proposal of personalized interventions, and the monitoring of patient progress using data extracted from clinical records. ChatGPT excels in areas such as nutritional assessment by calculating caloric needs and suggesting nutrient-rich foods, and in diagnosis, by identifying nutritional issues with technical terminology. In interventions, it offers dietary and educational strategies but lacks critical abilities such as interpreting non-verbal cues or performing physical examinations. Recent studies indicate that ChatGPT achieves high accuracy in questions related to clinical guidelines but shows deficiencies in integrating multiple medical conditions or ensuring the accuracy of meal plans. Additionally, generated plans may exhibit significant caloric deviations and imbalances in micronutrients such as vitamin D and B12. Despite its limitations, this AI has the potential to complement clinical practice by improving accessibility and personalization in nutritional care. However, its effective implementation requires professional supervision, integration with existing healthcare systems, and constant updates to its databases. In conclusion, while it does not replace nutrition experts, ChatGPT can serve as a valuable tool to optimize nutrition education and management of our patiens, always under the guidance of trained professionals.",de Luis D,Nutricion hospitalaria,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40066572/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40056933,Hot and cold fibrosis: The role of serum biomarkers to assess immune mechanisms and ECM-cell interactions in human fibrosis.,"Fibrosis is a pathological condition characterised by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, particularly collagens, leading to tissue scarring and organ dysfunction. In fibrosis, an imbalance between collagen synthesis (fibrogenesis) and degradation (fibrolysis) results in the deposition of fibrillar collagens disrupting the structural integrity of the ECM and, consequently, tissue architecture. Fibrosis is associated with a wide range of chronic diseases, including cirrhosis, kidney fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, and autoimmune diseases. Recently, the concept of ""hot"" and ""cold"" fibrosis has emerged, referring to the immune status within fibrotic tissues and the nature of fibrogenic signalling. Hot fibrosis is characterised by active immune cell infiltration and inflammation, while cold fibrosis is associated with auto- and paracrine myofibroblast activation, immune cell exclusion and quiescence. In this article, we explore the relationship between hot and cold fibrosis, the role of various types of collagens and their biologically active fragments in modulating the immune system, and how serological ECM biomarkers can help improve our understanding of the disease-relevant interactions between immune and mesenchymal cells in fibrotic tissues. Additionally, we draw lessons from immuno-oncology research in solid tumours to shed light on potential strategies for fibrosis treatment and highlight the advantage of having a ""hot fibrotic environment"" to treat fibrosis by enhancing collagen degradation through modulation of the immune system.",de Zawadzki A; Leeming DJ; Sanyal AJ; Anstee QM; Schattenberg JM; Friedman SL; Schuppan D; Karsdal MA,Journal of hepatology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40056933/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40052065,Use of artificial intelligence with retinal imaging in screening for diabetes-associated complications: systematic review.,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been used to automate detection of retinal diseases from retinal images with great success, in particular for screening for diabetic retinopathy, a major complication of diabetes. Since persons with diabetes routinely receive retinal imaging to evaluate their diabetic retinopathy status, AI-based retinal imaging may have potential to be used as an opportunistic comprehensive screening for multiple systemic micro- and macro-vascular complications of diabetes. We conducted a qualitative systematic review on published literature using AI on retina images to detect systemic diabetes complications. We searched three main databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science (January 1, 2000, to October 1, 2024). Research that used AI to evaluate the associations between retinal images and diabetes-associated complications, or research involving diabetes patients with retinal imaging and AI systems were included. Our primary focus was on articles related to AI, retinal images, and diabetes-associated complications. We evaluated each study for the robustness of the studies by development of the AI algorithm, size and quality of the training dataset, internal validation and external testing, and the performance. Quality assessments were employed to ensure the inclusion of high-quality studies, and data extraction was conducted systematically to gather pertinent information for analysis. This study has been registered on PROSPERO under the registration ID CRD42023493512. From a total of 337 abstracts, 38 studies were included. These studies covered a range of topics related to prediction of diabetes from pre-diabetes or non-diabeticindividuals (n = 4), diabetes related systemic risk factors (n = 10), detection of microvascular complications (n = 8) and detection of macrovascular complications (n = 17). Most studies (n = 32) utilized color fundus photographs (CFP) as retinal image modality, while others employed optical coherence tomography (OCT) (n = 6). The performance of the AI systems varied, with an AUC ranging from 0.676 to 0.971 in prediction or identification of different complications. Study designs included cross-sectional and cohort studies with sample sizes ranging from 100 to over 100,000 participants. Risk of bias was evaluated by using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and AXIS, with most studies scoring as low to moderate risk. Our review highlights the potential for the use of AI algorithms applied to retina images, particularly CFP, to screen, predict, or diagnose the various microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes. However, we identified few studies with longitudinal data and a paucity of randomized control trials, reflecting a gap between the development of AI algorithms and real-world implementation and translational studies.

40047058,Nutritional Education in Medical Curricula and Clinical Practice: A Scoping Review on the Knowledge Deficit Amongst Medical Students and Doctors.,"Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), accounting for 74% of deaths worldwide (World Health Organization 2024), are a major health concern and are often the result of poor dietary habits. To reduce the prevalence of chronic diseases healthcare professionals must encourage healthy eating, and therefore require the appropriate nutritional knowledge and skills. This scoping review critically synthesises the literature on nutrition education to understand why there is a gap in nutrition knowledge and skills among medical students and doctors (MSAD) in English-speaking countries, and the solutions which have been proposed in the literature to close this gap. This scoping review adhered to PRISMA Scr guidelines outlined by Tricco et al. (2018) and used four online databases: PubMed; WebOfScience; Embase and ERIC as well as grey literature sources: Google; Bing and Perplexity AI, published within the last 10 years, from 2014 to 2024. Studies investigating medical students/doctors nutrition education/knowledge were included. Data analysis was guided by Braun and Clarke's (2012) six-step thematic analysis approach and the Delve qualitative coding software analysis tool was used to identify the two principal themes and the 20 sub-themes. The PICO tool was also used for question analysis. From the 674 records identified, 28 papers met the inclusion criteria for full data extraction, analysis and synthesis. The results identified four reasons for the gap in nutrition knowledge, including insufficient curriculum time dedicated to nutrition education, perceptions and confidence, stigmas and health habits, and challenges in clinical practice. The review also identified four potential solutions to minimise this gap, including curriculum changes, enforcement of standardised nutrition education guidelines, integration of nutrition in clinical practice and promotion of a multidisciplinary approach to nutrition education. This scoping review shows that there are multiple complex reasons for the gap in nutrition knowledge and understanding. This is due to education institutional reasons; perceptions and confidence on nutrition; stigmas related to nutrition and being able to talk about nutrition; personal health habits; and challenges in clinical practice. Solutions to reduce the gap were identified and it is recommended that there are curricular innovations to incorporate nutrition education throughout medical training; standardisation and implementation of national competency standards; integration of nutrition into clinical practice; enhancement of postgraduate education pathways in nutrition; and the development of a multidisciplinary approach in medical education involving dietitians and other healthcare professionals. By enacting and supporting the recommendations and solutions would then improve patient care and likely contribute to better eating habits worldwide, thereby reducing the burden of NCDs to both patients and healthcare professionals.",Khiri N; Howells K,Journal of human nutrition and dietetics : the official journal of the British Dietetic Association,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40047058/,0,0,0,0,0,0

40024571,Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP).,"Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) was the first incretin identified and plays an essential role in the maintenance of glucose tolerance in healthy humans. Until recently GIP had not been developed as a therapeutic and thus has been overshadowed by the other incretin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which is the basis for several successful drugs to treat diabetes and obesity. However, there has been a rekindling of interest in GIP biology in recent years, in great part due to pharmacology demonstrating that both GIPR agonism and antagonism may be beneficial in treating obesity and diabetes. This apparent paradox has reinvigorated the field, led to new lines of investigation, and deeper understanding of GIP. In this review, we provide a detailed overview on the multifaceted nature of GIP biology and discuss the therapeutic implications of GIPR signal modification on various diseases. Following its classification as an incretin hormone, GIP has emerged as a pleiotropic hormone with a variety of metabolic effects outside the endocrine pancreas. The numerous beneficial effects of GIPR signal modification render the peptide an interesting candidate for the development of pharmacotherapies to treat obesity, diabetes, drug-induced nausea and both bone and neurodegenerative disorders.",Müller TD; Adriaenssens A; Ahrén B; Blüher M; Birkenfeld AL; Campbell JE; Coghlan MP; D'Alessio D; Deacon CF; DelPrato S; Douros JD; Drucker DJ; Figueredo Burgos NS; Flatt PR; Finan B; Gimeno RE; Gribble FM; Hayes MR; Hölscher C; Holst JJ; Knerr PJ; Knop FK; Kusminski CM; Liskiewicz A; Mabilleau G; Mowery SA; Nauck MA; Novikoff A; Reimann F; Roberts AG; Rosenkilde MM; Samms RJ; Scherer PE; Seeley RJ; Sloop KW; Wolfrum C; Wootten D; DiMarchi RD; Tschöp MH,Molecular metabolism,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40024571/,1,0,0,0,0,0

40023564,"Advanced data analytics and ""omics"" techniques to control enteric foodborne pathogens.","Enteric pathogens, particularly bacterial pathogens, are associated with millions of cases of foodborne illness in the U.S. and worldwide, necessitating the identification and development of methods to control and minimize their impact on public health. Predictive modeling and quantitative microbial risk assessment are two such methods that analyze data on microbial behavior, particularly as a response to changes in the food matrix, to predict and control the presence and prevalence of these pathogens in food. However, a number of these bacterial enteric pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella enterica, have inherent genetic and phenotypic differences among their subtypes and variants. This has led to an increasing reliance on ""omics"" technologies, including genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, to identify and characterize pathogenic microorganisms and their behavior in food systems. With this exponential increase in available data on these enteric pathogens, comes a need for the development of novel strategies to analyze this data. Advanced data analysis/analytics is a means to extract value from these large data sources, and is considered the core of data processing. In the past few years, advanced data analytics methods such as machine learning and artificial intelligence have been increasingly used to extract meaningful, actionable knowledge from these data sources to help mitigate food safety issues caused by enteric pathogens. This chapter reviews the latest in research into the use of advanced data analytics, particularly machine learning, to analyze ""omics"" data of enteric bacterial pathogens, and identifies potential future uses of these techniques in mitigating the risk of these pathogens on public health.",Karanth S; Pradhan AK,Advances in food and nutrition research,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40023564/,1,0,0,0,0,0

40004544,Interspecies Blastocyst Complementation and the Genesis of Chimeric Solid Human Organs.,"Solid organ transplantation remains a life-saving treatment for patients worldwide. Unfortunately, the supply of donor organs cannot meet the current need, making the search for alternative sources even more essential. Xenotransplantation using sophisticated genetic engineering techniques to delete and overexpress specific genes in the donor animal has been investigated as a possible option. However, the use of exogenous tissue presents another host of obstacles, particularly regarding organ rejection. Given these limitations, interspecies blastocyst complementation in combination with precise gene knockouts presents a unique, promising pathway for the transplant organ shortage. In recent years, great advancements have been made in the field, with encouraging results in producing a donor-derived organ in a chimeric host. That said, one of the major barriers to successful interspecies chimerism is the mismatch in the developmental stages of the donor and the host cells in the chimeric embryo. Another major barrier to successful chimerism is the mismatch in the developmental speeds between the donor and host cells in the chimeric embryos. This review outlines 19 studies in which blastocyst complementation was used to generate solid organs. In particular, the genesis of the liver, lung, kidney, pancreas, heart, thyroid, thymus and parathyroids was investigated. Of the 19 studies, 7 included an interspecies model. Of the 7, one was completed using human donor cells in a pig host, and all others were rat-mouse chimeras. While very promising results have been demonstrated, with great advancements in the field, several challenges continue to persist. In particular, successful chimerism, organ generation and donor contribution, synchronized donor-host development, as well as ethical concerns regarding human-animal chimeras remain important aspects that will need to be addressed in future research.",Bigliardi E; Shetty AV; Low WC; Steer CJ,Genes,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40004544/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39998964,Taking the Guess Work Out of Endoscopic Polyp Measurement: From Traditional Methods to AI.,"Colonoscopy is a crucial tool for evaluating lower gastrointestinal disease, monitoring high-risk patients for colorectal neoplasia, and screening for colorectal cancer. In the United States, over 14 million colonoscopies are performed annually, with a significant portion dedicated to post-polypectomy follow-up. Accurate measurement of colorectal polyp size during colonoscopy is essential, as it influences patient management, including the determination of surveillance intervals, resection strategies, and the assessment of malignancy risk. Despite its importance, many endoscopists typically rely on visual estimation alone, which is often imprecise due to technological and human biases, frequently leading to overestimations of polyp size and unnecessarily shortened surveillance intervals. To address these challenges, multiple tools and technologies have been developed to enhance the accuracy of polyp size estimation.

39980203,Modeling the Interplay Between Viral and Immune Dynamics in HIV: A Review and Mrgsolve Implementation and Exploration.,"Since its initial discovery, HIV has infected more than 70 million individuals globally, leading to the deaths of 35 million. At present, the annual number of deaths has significantly decreased due to 75% of HIV-positive individuals being on antiretroviral therapy. Although there is no cure yet, available treatments extend life expectancy, enhance quality of life, and reduce transmission by maintaining viral load below the detection limit of 50 copies/mL, making the individual's levels undetectable and untransmittable. HIV has attracted considerable attention in the computational modeling area, with various models having been developed with different degrees of complexity in an attempt to explain the viral dynamics of the disease. It is important to note that no single model can fully incorporate and predict all the critical factors influencing the dynamics of the disease and its response to treatments. Since the number of published models is large, the purpose of this article is to review several relevant models found in the literature that describe biologically plausible scenarios of HIV infection, including key features of disease progression with or without treatment. A total of 15 models are described, with some implemented in the mrgsolve package in R Studio and shared for the benefit of the scientific community. The modeling framework concerning HIV infection aids in identifying the most impactful parameters within the system and their implications in the model outcomes. Insights provided by these models may help in confirming targets for current and novel therapies, thereby contributing to the exploration of new strategies.",Vegas Rodriguez A; Velez de Mendizábal N; Girish S; Trocóniz IF; Feigelman JS,Clinical and translational science,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39980203/,1,0,0,0,0,0

SLD term includes a spectrum of defined and less defined disorders: metabolic dysfunction-associated SLD (MASLD), alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), and metabolic and ALD (Met-ALD), where both cardiometabolic risk factors, such as obesity, diabetes, or dyslipidemia, and alcohol consumption function in disease development and progression. Met-ALD is defined as liver disease in men with at least 1 cardiometabolic risk factor who also consume 210-420 g of alcohol per week (approximately 30-60 g per day), whereas for women, it is defined as at least 1 cardiometabolic risk factor in addition to consumption of 140-350 g of alcohol per week (approximately 20-50 g per day). This level of alcohol intake exceeds the thresholds traditionally used to exclude alcohol as a contributing factor in MASLD, but it remains below the levels typically associated with classic ALD. Met-ALD is estimated to affect about 17 million people in the United States It is a unique disease with the risk of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and mortality different from those with MASLD or ALD. Its treatment relies mainly on weight loss, alcohol abstinence, and control of cardiometabolic risk factors. Novel medications such as glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists and fibroblast growth factor s21 analogs may be promising future therapies for the treatment of Met-ALD.",Dunn N; Al-Khouri N; Abdellatif I; Singal AK,Clinical and translational gastroenterology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39969015/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39962541,Harnessing precision nutrition to individualize weight restoration in anorexia nervosa.,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe psychiatric disorder for which effective treatment and sustained recovery are contingent upon successful weight restoration, yet the efficacy of existing treatments is suboptimal. This narrative review considers the potential of precision nutrition for tailoring dietary interventions to individual characteristics to enhance acute and longer-term weight outcomes in AN. We review key factors that drive variation in nutritional requirements, including energy expenditure, fecal energy loss, the gut microbiota, genetic factors, and psychiatric comorbidities. Although scientific evidence supporting precision nutrition in AN is limited, preliminary findings suggest that individualized nutrition therapies, particularly those considering duration of illness and the gut microbiota, may augment weight gain. Some patients may benefit from microbiota-directed dietary plans that focus on restoring microbial diversity, keystone taxa, or functions that promote energy absorption, which could enhance weight restoration-although stronger evidence is needed to support this approach. Furthermore, accounting for psychiatric comorbidities such as depression and anxiety as well as genetic factors influencing metabolism may help refine nutrition prescriptions improving upon existing energy estimation equations, which were not developed for patients with AN. Given the reliance on large sample sizes, costly data collection, and the need for computationally intensive artificial intelligence algorithms to assimilate deep phenotypes into personalized interventions, we highlight practical considerations related to the implementation of precision nutrition approaches in clinical practice. More research is needed to identify which factors, including metabolic profiles, genetic markers, demographics, and habitual lifestyle behaviors, are most critical to target for individualizing weight restoration, and whether personalized recommendations can be practicably applied to improve and sustain patient recovery from this debilitating disorder with high relapse and mortality rates.",Rodriguez I; Huckins LM; Bulik CM; Xu J; Igudesman D,Journal of eating disorders,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39962541/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39961802,The current research status of immobilized lipase performance and its potential for application in food are developing toward green and healthy direction: A review.,"Immobilized lipases have received great attention in food, environment, medicine, and other fields due to their easy separation, high stability (temperature, pH), and high storage properties. After immobilization, lipase transforms from a homogeneous to a heterogeneous state, making it easier to recover from the reaction substrate and achieve recycling, which is in line with the concept of green chemistry and reduces protein contamination in the product. There are various materials for enzyme immobilization, including polysaccharides from natural sources, inorganic compounds, carbon nanotubes, metal-organic framework materials, and so forth. Magnetic immobilization carriers have been widely studied due to their ability to achieve separation by adding a magnetic field. Its immobilization method can be simply divided into two categories: physical action (adsorption, embedding) and chemical binding (covalent, cross-linking). Some studies mainly discuss the immobilization support materials, immobilization methods, and applications of immobilized lipases in food. On this basis, our review also focuses on the changes in crosslinking agents for immobilized lipases, different methods to promote immobilization, new trends in the study of immobilized lipases, and proposes prospects for immobilized lipase research in the food industry.",Wang N; Wang W; Su Y; Zhang J; Sun B; Ai N,Journal of food science,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39961802/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39960227,Artificial Intelligence for Diabetic Foot Screening Based on Digital Image Analysis: A Systematic Review.,"Early detection of diabetic foot complications is essential for effective management and prevention of complications. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology based on digital image analysis offers a promising noninvasive method for diabetic foot screening. This systematic review aims to identify a study on the development of an AI model for diabetic foot screening using digital image analysis. The review scrutinized articles published between 2018 and 2023, sourced from PubMed, ProQuest, and ScienceDirect. The keyword-based search resulted in 2214 relevant articles and nine articles that met the inclusion criteria. The article quality assessment was done through Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS). Data were extracted and analyzed using NVivo. Thermal imagery or foot thermogram was the main data source, with plantar temperature distribution patterns as an important indicator. Deep learning methods, specifically artificial neural networks (ANNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are the most commonly used methods. The highest performance is demonstrated by the ANN model with MATLAB's Image Processing Toolbox that is able to classify each type of macula with 97.5% accuracy. The findings show the great potential of AI in improving the accuracy and efficiency of diabetic foot screening. This research provides important insights into the development of AI in digital image-based diabetic foot screening.

39953910,Mistakes to avoid in the management of abdominal tuberculosis.,"The diagnosis and management of abdominal tuberculosis, i.e Gastrointestinal Tuberculosis (GITB) and tuberculous peritonitis (TBP) is challenging. Abdominal tuberculosis, presenting usually with abdominal pain, intestinal obstruction, and constitutional symptoms, is typically a paucibacillary condition. The diagnosis hinges on a correct interpretation of clinical, radiological, histological, biochemical, and microbiological findings as also appropriately assessing response to therapy. The authors review potential missteps that could occur in managing GITB and TBP sourced from published literature and clinical experience. These include avoiding excess use of tests with limited accuracy, understanding limitations of ascitic adenosine deaminase (ADA) and granulomas, avoiding empirical antitubercular therapy (ATT) where possible but also understanding that microbiological tests may not always be positive, and finally not to bank solely on subjective clinical responses but to use objective markers in assessing response to therapy. In addition, diagnosis of predisposing immunosuppressed states, attention to nutrition, appropriate management of sequelae with endoscopic dilatation/surgery, and early surgery when indicated are some of the additional issues discussed. In future, a more secure diagnosis banking on the use of better microbiological tools, multiparameter-based models, artificial intelligence-based approaches, and use of advances in -omics-based approaches can improve diagnosis and avoid some missteps.",Chatterjee A; Jha DK; Sekar A; Sharma V,Expert review of anti-infective therapy,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39953910/,1,0,0,0,0,0

39947217,Targeting the SARS-CoV-2 reservoir in long COVID.,"There are no approved treatments for post-COVID-19 condition (also known as long COVID), a debilitating disease state following SARS-CoV-2 infection that is estimated to affect tens of millions of people. A growing body of evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 can persist for months or years following COVID-19 in a subset of individuals, with this reservoir potentially driving long-COVID symptoms or sequelae. There is, therefore, an urgent need for clinical trials targeting persistent SARS-CoV-2, and several trials of antivirals or monoclonal antibodies for long COVID are underway. However, because mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 persistence are not yet fully understood, such studies require important considerations related to the mechanism of action of candidate therapeutics, participant selection, duration of treatment, standardisation of reservoir-associated biomarkers and measurables, optimal outcome assessments, and potential combination approaches. In addition, patient subgroups might respond to some interventions or combinations of interventions, making post-hoc analyses crucial. Here, we outline these and other key considerations, with the goal of informing the design, implementation, and interpretation of trials in this rapidly growing field. Our recommendations are informed by knowledge gained from trials targeting the HIV reservoir, hepatitis C, and other RNA viruses, as well as precision oncology, which share many of the same hurdles facing long-COVID trials.",Proal AD; Aleman S; Bomsel M; Brodin P; Buggert M; Cherry S; Chertow DS; Davies HE; Dupont CL; Deeks SG; Ely EW; Fasano A; Freire M; Geng LN; Griffin DE; Henrich TJ; Hewitt SM; Iwasaki A; Krumholz HM; Locci M; Marconi VC; Mehandru S; Muller-Trutwin M; Painter MM; Pretorius E; Price DA; Putrino D; Qian Y; Roan NR; Salmon D; Tan GS; VanElzakker MB; Wherry EJ; Van Weyenbergh J; Yonker LM; Peluso MJ,The Lancet.

The development of omics technologies has revolutionized our understanding of the microbiome, the generated complex datasets, as well as their processing and interpretation need to be taken seriously. Currently, chemometrics has shown huge potential in omics data analysis, which is crucial to reveal the functional attributes and mechanisms of microbiomes in food nutrition and safety. However, various chemometric tools have their own characteristics, selecting appropriate technologies and performing multiomics data fusion analysis to improve the precision and reliability of food microbial investigations is still a huge challenge. In this review, we summarized the omics technologies used in food microbiome studies, overviewed the principle and applicability of chemometrics in omics, and discussed the challenges and prospects of chemometrics. The urgent need for chemometrics is to integrate deep learning (DL) and artificial intelligence algorithms to enhance its analytical capabilities and prediction accuracy. We hope this review will provide valuable insights of the integration of multiomics and bioinformatics combined with various chemometric techniques in data analysis for food microbial investigation.

39939253,Effect of moderate alcohol intake on blood apolipoproteins concentrations: A meta-analysis of human intervention studies.,"This study assessed the effect of alcohol intake (up to 40 g/d) on blood apolipoproteins (APOs) concentration in human intervention studies. Additionally, it evaluates whether the effect of alcohol intake on APOs differs depending on sex. The literature search was performed in PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science databases. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was applied. A total of 5559 articles were identified, yielding 80 articles for full-text screening. Twenty-five articles were included for data extraction. Compared to no alcohol intake, alcohol intake up to a dose of 40 g/d showed an increase in Apolipoprotein A-I levels (ApoA-I) [mean difference (MD): 7.77 mg/dl, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 4.95 mg/dl, 10.59 mg/dl] and Apolipoprotein A-II levels (ApoA-II) [MD: 1.61 mg/dl, 95 % CI: 0.33 mg/dl, 2.90 mg/dl], but no significant change in Apolipoprotein B levels (ApoB) [MD: -0.06 mg/dl, 95 % CI: -3.38 mg/dl, 3.27 mg/dl]. Males showed a significant increase, while females showed a non-significant increase in ApoA-I levels [MD: 9.70 mg/dl, 95 % CI: 6.16 mg/dl, 13.28 mg/dl vs MD: 7.31 mg/dl, 95 % CI: -0.67 mg/dl, 15.30 mg/dl]. The results had less certainty as most studies were at high risk of bias. Alcohol consumption up to 40 g/d increases ApoA-I and ApoA-II levels. Further research is required for ApoB. Considerations should be given when applying this research to practice. High-quality clinical trials with large sample sizes and longer intervention periods are required, focusing on including female participants.

39936144,"Metal contamination - a global environmental issue: sources, implications & advances in mitigation.","Metal contamination (MC) is a growing environmental issue, with metals altering biotic and metabolic pathways and entering the human body through contaminated food, water and inhalation. With continued population growth and industrialisation, MC poses an exacerbating risk to human health and ecosystems. Metal contamination in the environment is expected to continue to increase, requiring effective remediation approaches and harmonised monitoring programmes to significantly reduce the impact on health and the environment. Bio-based methods, such as enhanced phytoextraction and chemical stabilisation, are being used worldwide to remediate contaminated sites. A systematic plant screening of potential metallophytes can identify the most effective candidates for phytoremediation. However, the detection and prediction of MC is complex, non-linear and chaotic, and it frequently overlaps with various other constraints. Rapidly evolving artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms offer promising tools for the detection, growth and activity modelling and management of metallophytes, helping to fill knowledge gaps related to complex metal-environment interactions in different scenarios. By integrating AI with advanced sensor technologies and field-based trials, future research could revolutionize remediation strategies.

39917741,Navigating next-gen nutrition care using artificial intelligence-assisted dietary assessment tools-a scoping review of potential applications.,"Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies have opened new avenues for their applications in dietary assessments. Conventional dietary assessment methods are time-consuming, labor-driven, and have high recall bias. AI-assisted tools can be user-friendly and provide accurate dietary data. Hence, this review aimed to explore the applications of AI-assisted dietary assessment tools in real-world settings that could potentially enhance Next-Gen nutrition care delivery. A total of 17,613 original, full-text articles using keywords such as ""artificial intelligence OR food image analysis OR wearable devices AND dietary OR nutritional assessment,"" published in English between January 2014 and September 2024 were extracted from Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed databases. All studies exploring applications of AI-assisted dietary assessment tools with human participation were included; While methodological/developmental research and studies without human participants were excluded as this review specifically aimed to explore their applications in real-world scenarios for clinical purposes. In the final phase of screening, 66 articles were reviewed that matched our inclusion criteria and the review followed PRISMA-ScR reporting guidelines. We observed that existing AI-assisted dietary assessment tools are integrated with mobile/web-based applications to provide a user-friendly interface. These tools can broadly be categorized as ""Image-based"" and ""Motion sensor-based."" Image-based tools allow food recognition, classification, food volume/weight, and nutrient estimation whereas, Motion sensor-based tools help capture eating occasions through wrist movement, eating sounds, jaw motion & swallowing. These functionalities capture the dietary data regarding the type of food or beverage consumed, calorie intake, portion sizes, frequency of eating, and shared eating occasions as real-time data making it more accurate as against conventional dietary assessment methods. Dietary assessment tools integrated with AI and ML could estimate real-time energy and macronutrient intake in patients with chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and dementia. Additionally, these tools are non-laborious, time-efficient, user-friendly, and provide fairly accurate data free from recall/reporting bias enabling clinicians to offer personalized nutrition. Therefore, integrating AI-based dietary assessment tools will help improve the quality of nutrition care and navigate next-gen nutrition care practices.

39907846,An Update of Fungal Endophyte Diversity and Strategies for Augmenting Therapeutic Potential of their Potent Metabolites: Recent Advancement.,"Endophytic fungi represent a significant renewable resource for the discovery of pharmaceutically important compounds, offering substantial potential for new drug development. Their ability to address the growing issue of drug resistance has drawn attention from researchers seeking novel, nature-derived lead molecules that can be produced on a large scale to meet global demand. Recent advancements in genomics, metabolomics, bioinformatics, and improved cultivation techniques have significantly aided the identification and characterization of fungal endophytes and their metabolites. Current estimates suggest there are approximately 1.20 million fungal endophytes globally, yet only around 16% (190,000) have been identified and studied in detail. This underscores the vast untapped potential of fungal endophytes in pharmaceutical research. Research has increasingly focused on the transformation of bioactive compounds by fungal endophytes through chemical and enzymatic processes. A notable example is the anthraquinone derivative 6-O-methylalaternin, whose cytotoxic potential is enhanced by the addition of a hydroxyl group, sharing structural similarities with its parent compound macrosporin. These structure-bioactivity studies open up new avenues for developing safer and more effective therapeutic agents by synthesizing targeted derivatives. Despite the immense promise, challenges remain, particularly in the large-scale cultivation of fungal endophytes and in understanding the complexities of their biosynthetic pathways. Additionally, the genetic manipulation of endophytes for optimized metabolite production is still in its infancy. Future research should aim to overcome these limitations by focusing on more efficient cultivation methods and deeper exploration of fungal endophytes' genetic and metabolic capabilities to fully harness their therapeutic potential.",Prajapati C; Rai SN; Singh AK; Chopade BA; Singh Y; Singh SK; Haque S; Prieto MA; Ashraf GM,Applied biochemistry and biotechnology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39907846/,1,0,0,0,0,0

39886643,Challenges in designing interventions for food insecure families with food allergy in a Californian latinx cohort.,"Food allergy poses substantial social, economic, and quality of life burdens which are even heavier for families that are struggling with food insecurity. In the United States (US), food insecurity disproportionately affects vulnerable and historically marginalized communities, such as Latino/a/x and Black households. Targeting these disparities via our recent Food Equality Initiative (FEI) research intervention was challenging due to the barriers faced by the target underserved populations, which included poor digital literacy, language barriers, and limited access to necessary resources. These barriers hindered our efforts to promote access to nutritious and safe food options for food-insecure families, potentially further exacerbating health disparities. Here we discuss common challenges and opportunities associated with conducting research interventions in underserved communities in the US-leveraging our experiences designing and implementing an intervention to improve food allergy management through supplemental nutrition assistance in a predominantly Spanish-speaking, lower-income neighborhood in Northern California. We also provide recommendations for other researchers regarding how to tailor research strategies to address these challenges, and in so doing reduce health disparities and promote positive health outcomes for vulnerable and historically marginalized communities.",Albarran M; Brown E; Martinez E; Chin AR; Sindher SB; Warren CM; Chinthrajah RS,Frontiers in allergy,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39886643/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39882755,Precision nutrition-based interventions for the management of obesity in children and adolescents up to the age of 19 years.,"Precision nutrition-based methods develop tailored interventions and/or recommendations accounting for determinants of intra- and inter-individual variation in response to the same diet, compared to current 'one-size-fits-all' population-level approaches. Determinants may include genetics, current dietary habits and eating patterns, circadian rhythms, health status, gut microbiome, socioeconomic and psychosocial characteristics, and physical activity. ​​​​In this systematic review, we examined the evidence base for the effect of interventions based on precision nutrition approaches on overweight and obesity in children and adolescents to help inform future research and global guidelines. To examine the impact of precision nutrition-based interventions for the management of obesity in children and adolescents in all their diversity. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science Core Collection, BIOSIS Previews, Global Index Medicus (all regions), IBECS, SciELO, PAHO, PAHO IRIS, WHO IRIS, WHOLIS, Bibliomap, and TRoPHI, as well as the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov. We last searched the databases on 23 July 2024. We did not apply any language restrictions. We included randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that evaluated precision nutrition-based interventions (accounting for 'omics' such as phenotyping, genotyping, gut microbiome; clinical data, baseline dietary intake, postprandial glucose response, etc., and/or including artificial intelligence such as machine learning methods) compared to general or one-size-fits-all interventions or no intervention in children and adolescents aged 0 to 9 years or 10 to 19 years with overweight or obesity. Two review authors independently conducted study screening, data extraction, and risk of bias and GRADE assessments. We used fixed-effect analyses. Our outcomes of interest were physical and mental well-being, physical activity, health-related quality of life, obesity-associated disability, and adverse events associated with the interventions as defined or measured by trialists, and weight change (reduction, stabilisation or maintenance). Two studies (3 references, 105 participants) conducted in Ukraine and Greece met our eligibility criteria. One study reported nonprofit funding sources, whilst the other did not report funding, and the certainty of evidence ranged from very low to low across outcomes (all measured at endpoint). Only one trial (65 participants) contributed data on our primary outcomes of interest. Precision nutrition-based intervention versus one-size-fits-all intervention or standard of care In children 0 to 9 years of age, evidence is very uncertain about the effect of a precision nutrition-based intervention (a computerised Decision Support Tool (DST) that incorporates a variety of participant data and provides personalised diet recommendations based on decision-tree algorithms) on body mass index (BMI) (mean difference (MD) -1.40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.48 to 0.68; 1 study, 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and on weight (MD -2.60 kg, 95% CI -8.42 to 3.22; 1 study, 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence) compared with a one-size-fits-all control intervention. In children and adolescents 10 to 19 years of age, evidence is very uncertain about the effect of a precision nutrition-based intervention (computerised DST) on BMI (MD 3.00 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95% CI -0.26 to 6.26; 1 study, 30 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and on weight (MD 11.40 kg, 95% CI -0.47 to 23.27; 1 study, 30 participants; very low-certainty evidence) compared with a one-size-fits-all control intervention. Based on data from two small studies with a total of 105 participants, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of precision nutrition-based interventions on body weight or BMI. This review was limited by the number of available randomised controlled trials in this relatively nascent field. Given these limitations, the two studies do not provide sufficient evidence to adequately inform practice. Future research should report participant outcome data, including outcomes related to mental, emotional, and functional well-being, in addition to biochemical and physical measures, stratified by World Health Organization-defined age groups (children (0 to 9 years), and children and adolescents (10 to 19 years)).

39861166,Targeting Cytokine-Mediated Inflammation in Brain Disorders: Developing New Treatment Strategies.,"Cytokine-mediated inflammation is increasingly recognized for playing a vital role in the pathophysiology of a wide range of brain disorders, including neurodegenerative, psychiatric, and neurodevelopmental problems. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) cause neuroinflammation, alter brain function, and accelerate disease development. Despite progress in understanding these pathways, effective medicines targeting brain inflammation are still limited. Traditional anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory drugs are effective in peripheral inflammatory illnesses. Still, they face substantial hurdles when applied to the central nervous system (CNS), such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and unwanted systemic effects. This review highlights the developing treatment techniques for modifying cytokine-driven neuroinflammation, focusing on advances that selectively target critical cytokines involved in brain pathology. Novel approaches, including cytokine-specific inhibitors, antibody-based therapeutics, gene- and RNA-based interventions, and sophisticated drug delivery systems like nanoparticles, show promise with respect to lowering neuroinflammation with greater specificity and safety. Furthermore, developments in biomarker discoveries and neuroimaging techniques are improving our ability to monitor inflammatory responses, allowing for more accurate and personalized treatment regimens. Preclinical and clinical trial data demonstrate the therapeutic potential of these tailored techniques. However, significant challenges remain, such as improving delivery across the BBB and reducing off-target effects. As research advances, the creation of personalized, cytokine-centered therapeutics has the potential to alter the therapy landscape for brain illnesses, giving patients hope for better results and a higher quality of life.",Mallick R; Basak S; Chowdhury P; Bhowmik P; Das RK; Banerjee A; Paul S; Pathak S; Duttaroy AK,"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39861166/,1,0,0,0,0,0

39856267,Personalising dietary advice for disease prevention: concepts and experiences.,"Personalised nutrition (PN) as a new endeavour emerged in the background of the human genome project with the ease to analyse genetic heterogeneity. First commercial offers with recommendations for diet and lifestyle changes, usually based on a few polymorphisms, entered markets soon after the presentation of the human genome blueprint. Although PN has seen many attempts, meanwhile, with the inclusion of other biomedical measures such as microbiome and/or continuous glucose monitoring, scientific assessments of such approaches in various settings revealed limited success. Although personalisation improved general compliance over generic advice, particular benefits in referring to biomedical measures and individual risks did, in most cases, not provide any significant advantage. Moreover, scholars criticised such approaches as of limited impact from a public health perspective by attracting mainly technology-open individuals of high social status and proper financial capabilities. Based on these experiences, new avenues for personalising dietary advice are developed, and those are going beyond pure biomedical data by assessing the entire food environment of the individual with its capabilities and constraints in the given life setting. Embedded into digital environments for data collection but also for bidirectional communication, new possibilities emerge. Artificial intelligence methods allow for the multitude of input data and highly complex decision trees to be derived to customize advice. And that can be delivered on the spot and in time in any language whenever decisions are made on what to buy or what to eat. But systems can also be employed to increase physical activity levels and for the adoption of a more healthy lifestyle in general.",Daniel H,Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39856267/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39842720,Perspective: Multiomics and Artificial Intelligence for Personalized Nutritional Management of Diabetes in Patients Undergoing Peritoneal Dialysis.,"Managing diabetes in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) is challenging due to the combined effects of dietary glucose, glucose from dialysate, and other medical complications. Advances in technology that enable continuous biological data collection are transforming traditional management approaches. This review explores how multiomics technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) are enhancing glucose management in this patient population. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) offers significant advantages over traditional markers, such as hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Unlike HbA1c, which reflects an mean glucose level, CGM provides real-time, dynamic glucose data that allow clinicians to make timely adjustments, leading to better glycemic control and outcomes. Multiomics approaches are valuable for understanding genetic factors that influence susceptibility to diabetic complications, particularly those related to advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Identifying genetic polymorphisms that modify a patient's response to AGEs allows for personalized treatments, potentially reducing the severity of diabetes-related pathologies. Metabolomic analyses of PD effluent are also promising, as they help identify early biomarkers of metabolic dysregulation. Early detection can lead to timely interventions and more tailored treatment strategies, improving long-term patient care. AI integration is revolutionizing diabetes management for PD patients by processing vast datasets from CGM, genetic, metabolic, and microbiome profiles. AI can identify patterns and predict outcomes that may be difficult for humans to detect, enabling highly personalized recommendations for diet, medication, and dialysis management. Furthermore, AI can assist clinicians by automating data interpretation, improving treatment plans, and enhancing patient education. Despite the promise of these technologies, there are limitations. CGM, multiomics, and AI require significant investment in infrastructure, training, and validation studies. Additionally, integrating these approaches into clinical practice presents logistical and financial challenges. Nevertheless, personalized, data-driven strategies offer great potential for improving outcomes in diabetes management for PD patients.",Mahdavi S; Anthony NM; Sikaneta T; Tam PY,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39842720/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39842719,"Data in Personalized Nutrition: Bridging Biomedical, Psycho-behavioral, and Food Environment Approaches for Population-wide Impact.","Personalized nutrition (PN) represents an approach aimed at delivering tailored dietary recommendations, products, or services to support both prevention and treatment of nutrition-related conditions and to improve individual health using genetic, phenotypic, medical, nutritional, and other pertinent information. However, current approaches have yielded limited scientific success in improving diets or in mitigating diet-related conditions. In addition, PN currently caters to a specific subgroup of the population rather than having a widespread impact on diet and health at a population level. Addressing these challenges requires integrating traditional biomedical and dietary assessment methods with psycho-behavioral, and novel digital and diagnostic methods for comprehensive data collection, which holds considerable promise in alleviating present PN shortcomings. This comprehensive approach not only allows for deriving personalized goals (""what should be achieved"") but also customizing behavioral change processes (""how to bring about change""). We herein outline and discuss the concept of ""Adaptive Personalized Nutrition Advice Systems,"" which blends data from 3 assessment domains: 1) biomedical/health phenotyping; 2) stable and dynamic behavioral signatures; and 3) food environment data. Personalized goals and behavior change processes are envisaged to no longer be based solely on static data but will adapt dynamically in-time and in-situ based on individual-specific data. To successfully integrate biomedical, behavioral, and environmental data for personalized dietary guidance, advanced digital tools (e.g., sensors) and artificial intelligence-based methods will be essential. In conclusion, the integration of both established and novel static and dynamic assessment paradigms holds great potential for transitioning PN from its current focus on elite nutrition to a widely accessible tool that delivers meaningful health benefits to the general population.",Linseisen J; Renner B; Gedrich K; Wirsam J; Holzapfel C; Lorkowski S; Watzl B; Daniel H; Leitzmann M,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39842719/,1,0,0,0,0,0

However, the results were controversial. A meta-analysis was conducted to reconfirm their associations and predictive performance. Databases of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library were searched. The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) or odds ratios (ORs) assessed the association, while the pooled area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) evaluated the predictive power. Ninety-four studies were included. Overall and subgroup meta-analyses demonstrated lower ALB and higher CAR were associated with IVIG resistance (ALB: SMD = -0.61; OR = 0.83; CAR: SMD = 1.47; OR = 1.69) and CALs (ALB: SMD = -0.56; OR = 0.92; CAR: SMD = 0.52). PNI was reduced in IVIG-resistant (SMD = -0.82) and coronary artery aneurysm (SMD = -0.18) patients in subgroup analysis and high PNI predicted the decreased risk of CALs in overall analysis (OR = 0.82). ALB, CAR, and PNI were a good or fair biomarker for differentiating IVIG-resistant (CALs) from IVIG-sensitive (non-CALs) patients (AUC > 0.6 or > 0.7). PA (SMD = -0.72) and BAR (SMD = 1.10) were differential in IVIG-resistant, but not in CAL patients compared with controls. AGR was not associated with CALs (<i>p</i> > 0.05).

39709531,"A bio-cultural tale of the past, present and future of human nutrition.","Human nutrition represents a dynamic interplay between biological evolution and cultural development, profoundly shaping dietary practices and health outcomes. This paper traces the dietary evolution of the genus Homo, from practices like foraging, scavenging, hunting, and gathering to the Neolithic transition towards agropastoral subsistence. These changes influenced human biology, evident in genetic adaptations such as lactase persistence and amylase gene copy variation, and reshaped societal structures and population dynamics. Cultural phenomena, including food rituals and dietary norms, further shaped community identities and nutritional habits. However, industrialization and globalization have introduced new challenges, including obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases, driven by processed food consumption and sedentary lifestyles. These issues are exacerbated by ancestral genetic predispositions, such as the ""thrifty gene"" hypothesis, which links evolutionary adaptations to modern health disparities in specific populations. Advances in nutrigenomics and personalized nutrition provide promising avenues for tailoring dietary interventions to individual genetic profiles, promoting health and preventing chronic diseases. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers innovative tools for diet assessment, tracking, and personalized guidance, presenting opportunities to address global health disparities. However, these technological advancements must navigate ethical concerns, data privacy issues, and cultural sensitivities. By taking into account biological, cultural, and technological perspectives, this study emphasizes the importance of integrating anthropological and nutritional sciences in addressing modern health challenges.

For example, genomic markers like MTHFR polymorphisms inform folate supplementation needs, while metabolomic markers such as glucose and insulin levels guide interventions in metabolic disorders. AI-driven tools streamline biomarker interpretation, optimize supplement selection, and enhance therapeutic outcomes by accounting for complex biomarker interactions and individual needs. <b>Limitations:</b> Despite these advancements, AI tools face significant challenges, including reliance on incomplete training datasets and a limited number of clinically validated algorithms. Additionally, most current research focuses on clinical populations, limiting generalizability to healthier populations. Long-term studies remain scarce, raising questions about the sustained efficacy and safety of biomarker-guided supplementation. Regulatory ambiguity further complicates the classification of supplements, especially when combinations exhibit pharmaceutical-like effects. <b>Conclusions:</b> Biomarker-guided DS prescription, augmented by AI, represents a cornerstone of personalized nutrition. While offering significant potential for precision and efficacy, advancing these strategies requires addressing challenges such as incomplete AI data, regulatory uncertainties, and the lack of long-term studies. By overcoming these obstacles, clinicians can better meet individual health needs, prevent diseases, and integrate precision nutrition into routine care.",Pokushalov E; Ponomarenko A; Shrainer E; Kudlay D; Miller R,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39683427/,1,0,0,0,0,0

One in 5 incident TB cases were attributable to malnutrition, more than double the fraction attributed to HIV. Like HIV, malnutrition is a cause of secondary immunodeficiency and has even been dubbed nutritionally acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (N-AIDS). However, malnutrition remains the neglected cousin of HIV in global TB elimination efforts. Malnutrition increases the risk for TB progression, increases disease severity, and worsens TB treatment outcomes. Thus, it is both a TB determinant and comorbidity. In this perspective, we discuss decades of data to make the case that N-AIDS, just like HIV/AIDS, also deserves special consideration in the TB elimination discourse. Fortunately, malnutrition is a modifiable risk factor and there is now empirical evidence that addressing nutrition can help us curb the TB pandemic. Recognizing malnutrition as a key determinant and comorbidity is key to detecting and treating the missing millions while also preventing additional millions from suffering TB disease.",Dauphinais MR; Koura KG; Narasimhan PB; Mehta S; Finkelstein JL; Heysell SK; Sinha P,BMC global and public health,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39681926/,1,0,0,0,0,0

To meet this ever-growing demand, broiler chickens with enhanced growth performance are being developed, but they often face challenges related to oxidative stress, which can adversely affect gut health. Phytobiotics, which are plant-derived feed additives known for their antimicrobial, antioxidant, immune-modulating, and growth-promoting properties, have emerged as promising natural alternatives to synthetic antibiotics. This review consolidates recent advancements in the use of phytobiotics-derived products from leaves, roots, seeds, flowers, and their extracts in broiler diets reared under standard experimental conditions, without the introduction of stressors. The focus is on elucidating the key mechanisms through which phytobiotics improve gut health, including their effects on gut morphology, integrity, microflora composition, antioxidant capacity, and immune function. The review highlights the potential of phytobiotics to revolutionize broiler nutrition by acting as natural enhancers of gut health. Research findings reveal that phytobiotics significantly improve intestinal health, and boost growth performance, offering a sustainable approach to managing to gut dysfunction. These findings indicate a potential shift in how gut-health related challenges in broilers can be addressed, moving towards natural phytobiotic therapy. However, several challenges persist. Optimizing the dosage of phytobiotics, ensuring consistent performance, and overcoming the limitations related to their extraction and application are key areas requiring further investigation. The review emphasizes the importance of continued research to refine phytobiotic formulations, explore synergistic effects, and incorporate advanced technologies such as AI-driven methods and precision nutrition to tailor feeding strategies more effectively. Additionally, the development of innovative delivery systems, such as nanoencapsulation, is suggested as a way to enhance the effectiveness and reliability of phytobiotics.

39608003,Artificial Intelligence Applications to Measure Food and Nutrient Intakes: Scoping Review.,"Accurate measurement of food and nutrient intake is crucial for nutrition research, dietary surveillance, and disease management, but traditional methods such as 24-hour dietary recalls, food diaries, and food frequency questionnaires are often prone to recall error and social desirability bias, limiting their reliability. With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), there is potential to overcome these limitations through automated, objective, and scalable dietary assessment techniques. However, the effectiveness and challenges of AI applications in this domain remain inadequately explored. This study aimed to conduct a scoping review to synthesize existing literature on the efficacy, accuracy, and challenges of using AI tools in assessing food and nutrient intakes, offering insights into their current advantages and areas of improvement. This review followed the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in 4 databases-PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and EBSCO-covering publications from the databases' inception to June 30, 2023. Studies were included if they used modern AI approaches to assess food and nutrient intakes in human subjects. The 25 included studies, published between 2010 and 2023, involved sample sizes ranging from 10 to 38,415 participants. These studies used a variety of input data types, including food images (n=10), sound and jaw motion data from wearable devices (n=9), and text data (n=4), with 2 studies combining multiple input types. AI models applied included deep learning (eg, convolutional neural networks), machine learning (eg, support vector machines), and hybrid approaches. Applications were categorized into dietary intake assessment, food detection, nutrient estimation, and food intake prediction. Food detection accuracies ranged from 74% to 99.85%, and nutrient estimation errors varied between 10% and 15%. For instance, the RGB-D (Red, Green, Blue-Depth) fusion network achieved a mean absolute error of 15% in calorie estimation, and a sound-based classification model reached up to 94% accuracy in detecting food intake based on jaw motion and chewing patterns. In addition, AI-based systems provided real-time monitoring capabilities, improving the precision of dietary assessments and demonstrating the potential to reduce recall bias typically associated with traditional self-report methods. While AI demonstrated significant advantages in improving accuracy, reducing labor, and enabling real-time monitoring, challenges remain in adapting to diverse food types, ensuring algorithmic fairness, and addressing data privacy concerns. The findings suggest that AI has transformative potential for dietary assessment at both individual and population levels, supporting precision nutrition and chronic disease management. Future research should focus on enhancing the robustness of AI models across diverse dietary contexts and integrating biological sensors for a holistic dietary assessment approach.",Zheng J; Wang J; Shen J; An R,Journal of medical Internet research,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39608003/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Therefore, therapies to specifically inhibit tumor-infiltrating Treg represent a challenge, because Treg are distributed throughout the body and provide physiological immune homeostasis to prevent autoimmune diseases. Characterization of immunological and functional profiles could help to identify the mechanisms that need to be inhibited or activated to ensure Treg modulation in the tumor. To address this, quantitative in silico approaches based on mechanistic mathematical models integrating multi-scale information from immune and tumor cells and the effect of different therapies have allowed the building of computational frameworks to simulate different hypotheses, some of which have subsequently been experimentally validated. Therefore, this review presents a list of diverse computational mathematical models that examine the role of Treg as a crucial immune resistance mechanism contributing to the failure of immunotherapy. In addition, this review highlights the relevance of certain molecules expressed in Treg that are associated with the TME immunosuppression, which could be incorporated into the mathematical model for a better understanding of the contribution of Treg modulation. Finally, different preclinical and clinical combinations of molecules are also included to show the trend of new therapies targeting Treg.",Serrano A; Zalba S; Lasarte JJ; Troconiz IF; Riva N; Garrido MJ,Pharmaceutics,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39598584/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39591925,"Male reproductive biotechnologies in South American Camelids Part II: Semen dilution, cryopreservation and artificial insemination.","Even though South American Camelids (SAC) are a rustic species, adapted to harsh environments, their ability to reproduce is low in their natural habitat. Conception and birth rates in camelids vary from 50 % to 90 %. This depends on the mating system used, sire and dam fertility, postpartum interval, environmental conditions, and nutrition. Reproductive biotechnology can reduce generation intervals and quickly spread high-quality genetics, addressing the growing need for genetically superior animals. The advantages of using artificial insemination (AI) and semen preservation are widely known. However, no cryopreservation protocol providing an acceptable sperm survival and pregnancy rate after thawing is currently available for SAC. Not having an effective semen cryopreservation protocol has hindered rapid genetic improvement and efficient use of males. For all these reasons, this biotechnology is currently only used for research purposes but not commercially in SAC. In Part I of this review on reproductive biotechnology, the initial steps of semen and/or sperm collection, evaluation and handling were discussed. The objective of Part II of the review is to describe the progress achieved in semen or sperm dilution, cooling and freezing. Current results obtained using AI in SAC will also be covered.",Carretero MI; Neild DM; Bertuzzi ML; Giuliano SM,Animal reproduction science,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39591925/,1,0,0,0,0,0

39577269,Improving the efficacy of progesterone pessary treatment for synchrony of estrus in the sheep.,"Treatment with intra-vaginal progesterone pessaries for synchrony of estrus is essential in fixed-time artificial insemination (AI) of sheep. Globally, the conventional 14-day pessary treatment is the mainstay of commercial AI programs. It has remained largely unchanged for many decades even though it is associated with variable patterns of estrus and often disappointing pregnancy rates. Until recently, an understanding of this variability has been elusive. Here we review research of the last 25 years and conclude that synchronising estrus and obtaining satisfactory pregnancy rates (≥75 %) following AI is more challenging than expected from the original research of the 1960s. In particular, conventional pessary treatment is unable to control the time of emergence of the ovulatory follicle and the resultant variability in follicle age affects fertility. Additionally, the pessary is unable to mitigate the effects of season, nutrition and cyclical status of the ewe on the timing of estrus. It is concluded that the inability of pessary treatment to produce a uniform synchrony together with the adverse effects on follicle quality are primarily responsible for variable pregnancy rates. However, there are strategies to improve AI success rates. The first involves controlling the time of emergence of the ovulatory follicle so that it occurs primarily during the most fertile period of pessary treatment (Days 7-9 of a 14-day treatment). The second involves improving the synchrony of estrus by enhancing circulating levels of progesterone late (Day 9) in the treatment period. The third involves the use of short-term pessary treatments (5-7 days) that avoid some of the abnormalities associated with conventional treatment. Finally, given the variability in the timing of estrus, we address the challenge of optimising the time of insemination, an essential requirement of successful AI programs.",Walker SK; Weaver AC; Swinbourne AMS; Kelly JM; Kleemann DO,Theriogenology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39577269/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Millets are essential for global food security and nutrition, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. They are crucial in promoting nutrition, climate resilience, economic development, and cultural heritage. Despite their critical role, millets have historically received less investment in developing genomic resources than major cereals like wheat, maize, and rice. However, recent advancements in genomics, particularly next-generation sequencing technologies, offer unprecedented opportunities for rapid improvement in millet crops. This review paper provides an overview of the status of genomic resources in millets and in harnessing the recent opportunities in artificial intelligence to address challenges in millet crop improvement to boost productivity, nutrition, and end quality.

39558334,cGAS/STING in skin melanoma: from molecular mechanisms to therapeutics.,"Melanoma, recognized as the most aggressive type of skin cancer, has experienced a notable increase in cases, especially within populations with fair skin. This highly aggressive cancer is largely driven by UV radiation exposure, resulting in the uncontrolled growth and malignant transformation of melanocytes. The cGAS-STING pathway, an immune signaling mechanism responsible for detecting double-stranded DNA in the cytoplasm, is essential for mediating the immune response against melanoma. This pathway serves a dual purpose: it enhances antitumor immunity by activating immune cells, but it can also promote tumor growth when chronically activated by creating an immunosuppressive environment. This review comprehensively examines the multifaceted implication of the cGAS-STING pathway in melanoma pathogenesis and treatment. We explore its molecular mechanisms, including epigenetic regulation, interaction with signaling pathways such as AR signaling, and modulation by various cellular effectors like TG2 and activin-A. The therapeutic potential of modulating the cGAS-STING pathway is highlighted, with promising results from STING agonists, combination therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors, and novel drug delivery systems, including nanoparticles and synthetic drugs. Our findings underscore the importance of the cGAS-STING pathway in melanoma, presenting it as a critical target for enhancing anti-tumor immunity. By leveraging this pathway, future therapeutic strategies can potentially convert 'cold' tumors into 'hot' tumors, making them more susceptible to immune responses.",Mahin J; Xu X; Li L; Zhang C,Cell communication and signaling : CCS,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39558334/,1,0,0,0,0,0

This enzyme superfamily is one of the most versatile in the biosynthesis of a plethora of NPs finding use across the food, nutrition, medicine, chemical and cosmetics industries. These enzymes often exhibit excellent regio- and stereoselectivity, but they can suffer from low activity and instability, which are serious issues impairing the development of high performing bioprocesses. We start with a brief introduction to industrial biotechnology and the importance of looking for alternative means for producing NPs independently from unsustainable fossil fuels or plant extractions. We then discuss the challenges and implemented solutions during the development of commercial NP processes focusing on the P450-dependent steps primarily in yeast cell factories. Our main focus is to highlight the challenges often encountered when utilizing P450-dependent NP pathways, and how protein engineering can be used for debottlenecking them.

39546777,Advancements in Using AI for Dietary Assessment Based on Food Images: Scoping Review.,"To accurately capture an individual's food intake, dietitians are often required to ask clients about their food frequencies and portions, and they have to rely on the client's memory, which can be burdensome. While taking food photos alongside food records can alleviate user burden and reduce errors in self-reporting, this method still requires trained staff to translate food photos into dietary intake data. Image-assisted dietary assessment (IADA) is an innovative approach that uses computer algorithms to mimic human performance in estimating dietary information from food images. This field has seen continuous improvement through advancements in computer science, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI). However, the technical nature of this field can make it challenging for those without a technical background to understand it completely. This review aims to fill the gap by providing a current overview of AI's integration into dietary assessment using food images. The content is organized chronologically and presented in an accessible manner for those unfamiliar with AI terminology. In addition, we discuss the systems' strengths and weaknesses and propose enhancements to improve IADA's accuracy and adoption in the nutrition community. This scoping review used PubMed and Google Scholar databases to identify relevant studies. The review focused on computational techniques used in IADA, specifically AI models, devices, and sensors, or digital methods for food recognition and food volume estimation published between 2008 and 2021. A total of 522 articles were initially identified. On the basis of a rigorous selection process, 84 (16.1%) articles were ultimately included in this review. The selected articles reveal that early systems, developed before 2015, relied on handcrafted machine learning algorithms to manage traditional sequential processes, such as segmentation, food identification, portion estimation, and nutrient calculations. Since 2015, these handcrafted algorithms have been largely replaced by deep learning algorithms for handling the same tasks. More recently, the traditional sequential process has been superseded by advanced algorithms, including multitask convolutional neural networks and generative adversarial networks. Most of the systems were validated for macronutrient and energy estimation, while only a few were capable of estimating micronutrients, such as sodium. Notably, significant advancements have been made in the field of IADA, with efforts focused on replicating humanlike performance. This review highlights the progress made by IADA, particularly in the areas of food identification and portion estimation. Advancements in AI techniques have shown great potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of this field. However, it is crucial to involve dietitians and nutritionists in the development of these systems to ensure they meet the requirements and trust of professionals in the field.",Chotwanvirat P; Prachansuwan A; Sridonpai P; Kriengsinyos W,Journal of medical Internet research,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39546777/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39532062,Food additives as photosensitizers: A systematic review and narrative synthesis.,"Photosensitizers are the key molecules determining the efficacy of anti-microbial photodynamic inactivation. However, photosensitizers for clinical use frequently fail to satisfy safety standards required by the food industry. A variety of strategies could be employed to address these issues i.e. focusing on photosensitizers with high efficiency (>3-log decrease in CFU), on food additives with minimal effects on food qualities (taste, texture, appearance, or nutrients), and also approved photosensitizers by regulatory authorities. This review summarizes 48 relevant studies that reported on the photodynamic activities of approved food additives. We report food additives with favorable photosensitive properties, which are capable of producing reactive oxygen species upon exposure to light at appropriate wavelengths, thereby inactivating various foodborne pathogens with great promise for food sterilization. The information presented in this systematic review may provide practical insights for implementation of photodynamic inactivation in industrial settings and encourage future development of food-grade photosensitizers for food sterilization.",Dai W; Hu J; Tan BK; Lin S,Food chemistry,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39532062/,0,1,0,0,0,0

To conduct a systematic review to compare performance of CADe-enhanced and conventional colonoscopy. Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection databases were searched through February 2024. Published RCTs comparing CADe-enhanced and conventional colonoscopy. Average adenoma per colonoscopy (APC) and ACN per colonoscopy were primary outcomes. Adenoma detection rate, AMR, and ACN detection rate (ACN DR) were secondary outcomes. Balancing outcomes included withdrawal time and resection of nonneoplastic polyps (NNPs). Subgroup analyses were done by neural network architecture. Forty-four RCTs with 36 201 cases were included. Computer-aided detection-enhanced colonoscopies have higher average APC (12 090 of 12 279 [0.98] vs. 9690 of 12 292 [0.78], incidence rate difference [IRD] = 0.22 [95% CI, 0.16 to 0.28]) and higher ADR (7098 of 16 253 [44.7%] vs. 5825 of 15 855 [36.7%], rate ratio [RR] = 1.21 [CI, 1.15 to 1.28]). Average ACN per colonoscopy was similar (1512 of 9296 [0.16] vs. 1392 of 9121 [0.15], IRD = 0.01 [CI, -0.01 to 0.02]), but ACN DR was higher with CADe system use (1260 of 9899 [12.7%] vs. 1119 of 9746 [11.5%], RR = 1.16 [CI, 1.02 to 1.32]). Using CADe systems resulted in resection of almost 2 extra NNPs per 10 colonoscopies and longer total withdrawal time (0.53 minutes [CI, 0.30 to 0.77]). Statistically significant heterogeneity in quality and sample size and inability to blind endoscopists to the intervention in included studies may affect the performance estimates. Computer-aided detection-enhanced colonoscopies have increased APC and detection rate but no difference in ACN per colonoscopy and a small increase in ACN DR.

The impact of extracted pulse proteins remains unclear. We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of the effect of extracted pulse proteins on therapeutic lipid targets. MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched through April 2024 for trials of ≥3-weeks. The primary outcome was low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C). The secondary outcomes were other lipid targets. Independent reviewers extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Subgroup analyses included by pulse type and the certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE. Seven included trials (14 trial comparisons, n = 453) with a median of 4-weeks duration and dose of 35 g/day showed that extracted pulse proteins decreased LDL-C by -0.23 mmol/L (95% confidence interval: -0.36 to -0.10 mmol/L, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Similar effects were observed for non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B. No interactions were found by pulse type. Subgroup analyses revealed effect modification by sex, with greater proportions of females seeing greater reductions. GRADE was generally moderate. Extracted pulse proteins likely result in moderate reductions in LDL-C and other lipid targets. Future studies on various types of extracted pulse proteins including assessments by sex are warranted.",Yang S; Back S; Grant SM; Ayoub-Charette S; Chen V; Lin EJ; Haintz L; Chen YT; Ahmad E; Gahagan J; Marinangeli CPF; Ha V; Khan TA; Mejia SB; Zurbau A; de Souza RJ; Beyene J; English MM; Vuksan V; Josse RG; Leiter LA; Kendall CWC; Jenkins DJA; Sievenpiper JL; Chiavaroli L,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39519598/,0,1,0,1,0,0
39504432,The ABCDs of Nutritional Assessment in Infectious Diseases Research.,"Malnutrition is the most common acquired cause of immunodeficiency worldwide. Nutritional deficiencies can blunt both the innate and adaptive immune response to pathogens. Furthermore, malnutrition is both a cause and consequence of infectious diseases. The bidirectional relationship between infectious diseases and undernutrition, as well as the inflammatory milieu of infectious diseases, can complicate nutritional assessment. This article aims to provide clinicians and researchers with an overview of commonly used tools to assess nutritional status, with a particular emphasis on their use in the context of infectious diseases. These tools include anthropometric, biochemical, clinical/physical, and dietary assessments to screen and evaluate undernutrition, diet quality, and food insecurity effectively.",Locks LM; Parekh A; Newell K; Dauphinais MR; Cintron C; Maloomian K; Yu EA; Finkelstein JL; Mehta S; Sinha P,The Journal of infectious diseases,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39504432/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39448248,Unmet Needs in Spondyloarthritis: Imaging in Axial Spondyloarthritis.,"Imaging biomarkers in axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) are currently the most specific biomarkers for the diagnosis of this condition. Despite advances in imaging, from plain radiographs-which detect only damage-to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-which identifies disease activity and structural change-there are still many challenges that remain. Imaging in sacroiliitis is characterized by active and structural changes. Current classification criteria stress the importance of bone marrow edema (BME); however, BME can occur in various diseases, mechanical conditions, and healthy individuals. Thus, the identification of structural lesions such as erosion, subchondral fat, backfill, and ankylosis is important to distinguish from mimics on differential diagnosis. Various imaging modalities are available to examine structural lesions, but computed tomography (CT) is considered the current reference standard. Nonetheless, recent advances in MRI allow for direct bone imaging and the reconstruction of CT-like images that can provide similar information. Therefore, the ability of MRI to detect and measure structural lesions is strengthened. Here, we present an overview of the spectrum of current and cutting-edge techniques for SpA imaging in clinical practice; namely, we discuss the advantages, disadvantages, and usefulness of imaging in SpA through radiography, low-dose and dual-energy CT, and MRI. Cutting-edge MRI sequences including volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination, ultrashort echo time, zero echo time, and deep learning-based synthetic CT that creates CT-like images without ionizing radiation, are discussed. Imaging techniques allow for quantification of inflammatory and structural lesions, which is important in the assessment of treatment response and disease progression. Radiographic damage is poorly sensitive to change. Artificial intelligence has already revolutionized radiology practice, including protocolization, image quality, and image interpretation.",Gensler LS; Jans L; Majumdar S; Poddubnyy D,The Journal of rheumatology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39448248/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39442275,Perspectives in milk production in India.,"India is the largest milk producer contributing 25 % to the global production. From a mere 17 million tons (MTs) in 1951, milk production increased to an inconceivable 230 MTs in 2023. Nondescript cows and buffaloes were the main milk animals. Since 1965, nationwide programs for cross breeding native cattle with exotic milk breeds such as Jersey, Holstein Friesian (HF) and Brown Swiss (BS) and upgradation of buffalo breeds along with disease eradication, feed and fodder development and provision of veterinary and extension services were implemented. Now 75 % of the milk in India is produced by the native, exotic and crossbred cows (43 %) and native breeds of buffaloes (32 %). National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) created dairy cooperatives, an Indian innovation to connect rural milk producers to urban and semi-urban consumers. These cooperatives transformed subsistence dairy farming into a profitable rural enterprise and created millions of jobs. Due to the success of the above activities, since 1998 India continues to produce the highest volumes of milk in the world. It is envisioned to increase (i) milk production to 450 million tons (MTs) (one-third of the global production) (ii) gain a share of 15 % in global milk and milk products exports and (iii) build sustainable green practices to match global standards during the next 25 years. India is increasingly deploying artificial insemination (AI) with sex sorted-frozen semen, embryo transfer and in vitro production of embryos using sex sorted semen, progeny testing and genomic selection to improve reproduction and productivity among dairy animals. Mitigation of disease burden is undertaken through nationwide vaccination against diseases such as Foot and Mouth, TB, Brucellosis etc. Nutritious fodder crops and feed additives that support higher productivity and reduce enteric methane emissions are promoted. Management and interventional practices such as better nutrition, amelioration of summer stress, oestrus synchronisation etc., are increasingly implemented. Use of internet enabled technology services (IETS) for extension activities, mobile veterinary and animal husbandry services are rapidly becoming commonplace. All these practices portend greater achievements in milk production in the fore-seeable future.

39433088,Effect of Soy Isoflavones on Measures of Estrogenicity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"Despite recommendations to increase plant food consumption for public and planetary health and the role that soy foods can play in plant-predominant diets, controversies around the effects of soy foods, especially soy isoflavones, are a barrier to their intake. Given their cardioprotective effects and ability to alleviate menopausal symptoms, addressing these concerns is particularly relevant to women. This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials aimed to determine the effect of soy isoflavones on measures of estrogenicity in postmenopausal women. MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched through August 2024 for randomized trials ≥3-mo investigating soy isoflavones compared with non-isoflavone controls in postmenopausal women. Outcomes included endometrial thickness (ET), vaginal maturation index (VMI), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and estradiol. Independent authors extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation was used to assess certainty of evidence. We included 40 trials (52 trial comparisons, n = 3285) assessing the effect of a median reported dose of 75 mg/d of soy isoflavones in substitution for non-isoflavone controls over a median of 24 wk. Soy isoflavones had no statistically significant effect on any measure of estrogenicity; ET [mean difference, -0.22 mm (95% confidence interval, -0.45, 0.01 mm), P<sub>MD</sub> = 0.059], VMI [2.31 (-2.14, 6.75), P<sub>MD</sub> = 0.310], FSH [-0.02 IU/L (-2.39, 2.35 IU/L), P<sub>MD</sub> = 0.987], and estradiol [1.61 pmol/L (-1.17, 4.38 pmol/L), P<sub>MD</sub> = 0.256]. The certainty of evidence was high to moderate for all outcomes. Current evidence suggests that soy isoflavones do not exhibit estrogenic effects compared with non-isoflavone controls on 4 measures of estrogenicity in postmenopausal women. This synthesis supports that soy isoflavones likely act as selective estrogen receptor modulators, differing clinically from the hormone estrogen. Addressing public health concerns may promote soy foods as high-quality plant protein sources with low environmental impact and cost, particularly benefiting postmenopausal women and aligning with sustainable dietary patterns and guidelines.

39395091,Antioxidant Properties of Postbiotics: An Overview on the Analysis and Evaluation Methods.,"Antioxidants found naturally in foods have a significant effect on preventing several human diseases. However, the use of synthetic antioxidants in studies has raised concerns about their potential link to liver disease and cancer. The findings show that postbiotics have the potential to act as a suitable alternative to chemical antioxidants in the food and pharmaceutical sectors. Postbiotics are bioactive compounds generated by probiotic bacteria as they ferment prebiotic fibers in the gut. These compounds can also be produced from a variety of substrates, including non-prebiotic carbohydrates such as starches and sugars, as well as proteins and organic acids, all of which probiotics utilize during the fermentation process. These are known for their antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer properties that help improve human health. Various methodologies have been suggested to assess the antioxidant characteristics of postbiotics. While there are several techniques to evaluate the antioxidant properties of foods and their bioactive compounds, the absence of a convenient and uncomplicated method is remarkable. However, cell-based assays have become increasingly important as an intermediate method that bridges the gap between chemical experiments and in vivo research due to the limitations of in vitro and in vivo assays. This review highlights the necessity of transitioning towards more biologically relevant cell-based assays to effectively evaluate the antioxidant activity of postbiotics. These experiments are crucial for assessing the biological efficacy of dietary antioxidants. This review focuses on the latest applications of the Caco-2 cell line in the assessment of cellular antioxidant activity (CAA) and bioavailability. Understanding the impact of processing processes on the biological properties of postbiotic antioxidants can facilitate the development of new food and pharmaceutical products.",Hosseinzadeh N; Asqardokht-Aliabadi A; Sarabi-Aghdam V; Hashemi N; Dogahi PR; Sarraf-Ov N; Homayouni-Rad A,Probiotics and antimicrobial proteins,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39395091/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39379339,Candidemia Following Severe COVID-19 in Hospitalised and Critical Ill Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The epidemiology and clinical impact of COVID-19-associated candidemia (CAC) remained uncertain, leaving gaps in understanding its prevalence, risk factors and outcomes. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted by searching PubMed, Embase and Scopus for reports of CAC prevalence, risk factors and clinical outcomes up to June 18, 2024. The generalised linear mixed model was employed to determine the prevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The risk factors and clinical outcomes were compared between patients with and without CAC using the inverse variance method. From 81 studies encompassing 29 countries and involving 351,268 patients, the global prevalence of CAC was 4.33% (95% Cl, 3.16%-5.90%) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. In ICUs, the pooled prevalence of CAC in high-income countries was significantly higher than that of lower-middle-income countries (5.99% [95% Cl, 4.24%-8.40%] vs. 2.23% [95% Cl, 1.06%-4.61%], p = 0.02). Resistant Candida species, including C. auris, C. glabrata (Nakaseomyces glabratus) and C. krusei (Pichia kudriavzveii), constituted 2% of ICU cases. The mortality rate for CAC was 68.40% (95% Cl, 61.86%-74.28%) among ICU patients. Several risk factors were associated with CAC, including antibiotic use, central venous catheter placement, dialysis, mechanical ventilation, tocilizumab, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and total parenteral nutrition. Notably, the pooled odds ratio of tocilizumab was 2.59 (95% CI, 1.44-4.65). The prevalence of CAC is substantial in the ICU setting, particularly in high-income countries. Several risk factors associated with CAC were identified, including several that are modifiable, offering the opportunity to mitigate the risk of CAC.",Srisurapanont K; Lerttiendamrong B; Meejun T; Thanakitcharu J; Manothummetha K; Thongkam A; Chuleerarux N; Sanguankeo A; Li LX; Leksuwankun S; Langsiri N; Torvorapanit P; Worasilchai N; Plongla R; Moonla C; Nematollahi S; Kates OS; Permpalung N,Mycoses,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39379339/,0,1,0,1,0,0

Yet, the impaired signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per square root of time, or SNR efficiency, leading in turn to prolonged acquisition times, still challenges its relevance at the clinical level. To address this, researchers investigate various hardware and software solutions to improve SNR efficiency at low field, including the leveraging of latest advances in computing hardware. However, there may not be a single recipe for improving SNR at low field, and it is key to embrace the challenges and limitations of each proposed solution. In other words, suitable solutions depend on the final objective or application envisioned for a low-field scanner and, more importantly, on the characteristics of a specific low <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <semantics> <mrow><msub><mi>B</mi> <mn>0</mn></msub> </mrow> <annotation>$$ {B}_0 $$</annotation></semantics> </math> field.

39374798,Engineered transcription factor-binding diversed functional nucleic acid-based synthetic biosensor.,"Engineered transcription factors (eTFs) binding diversed functional nucleic acids (dFNAs), as innovative biorecognition systems, have gradually become indispensable core elements for building synthetic biosensors. They not only circumvent the limitations of the original TF-based biosensing technologies, but also inject new vitality into the field of synthetic biosensing. This review aims to provide the first comprehensive and systematic dissection of the eTF-dFNA synthetic biosensor concept. Firstly, the core principles and interaction mechanisms of eTF-dFNA biosensors are clarified. Next, we elaborate on the construction strategies of eTF-dFNA synthetic biosensors, detailing methods for the personalized customization of eTFs (irrational design, rational design, and semi-rational design) and dFNAs (SELEX, modifying and predicting), along with the exploration of strategies for the flexible selection of signal amplification and output modes. Furthermore, we discuss the exceptional performance and substantial advantages of eTF-dFNA synthetic biosensors, analyzing them from four perspectives: recognition domain, detection speed, sensitivity, and construction methodology. Building upon this analysis, we present their outstanding applications in point-of-care diagnostics, food-safety detection, environmental monitoring, and production control. Finally, we address the current limitations of eTF-dFNA synthetic biosensors candidly and envision the future direction of this technology, aiming to provide valuable insights for further research and applications in this burgeoning field.",Liu Y; Zhou Z; Wu Y; Wang L; Cheng J; Zhu L; Dong Y; Zheng J; Xu W,Biotechnology advances,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39374798/,1,0,0,0,0,0

39362617,Global Progression Rates of Precursor Lesions for Gastric Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Whether gastric cancer (GC) precursor lesions progress to invasive cancer at similar rates globally remains unknown. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the progression of precursor lesions to GC in countries with low versus medium/high incidence. We searched relevant databases for studies reporting the progression of endoscopically confirmed precursor lesions to GC. Studies were stratified by low (<6 per 100,000) or medium/high (≥6 per 100,000) GC incidence countries. Random-effects models were used to estimate the progression rates of atrophic gastritis (AG), intestinal metaplasia (IM), and dysplasia to GC per 1000 person-years. Among the 5829 studies identified, 44 met our inclusion criteria. The global pooled estimates of the progression rate per 1000 person-years were 2.09 (95% confidence interval, 1.46-2.99), 2.89 (2.03-4.11), and 10.09 (5.23-19.49) for AG, IM, and dysplasia, respectively. The estimated progression rates per 1000 person-years for low versus medium/high GC incidence countries, respectively, were 0.97 (0.86-1.10) versus 2.47 (1.70-2.99) for AG (P < .01), 2.37 (1.43-3.92) versus 3.47 (2.13-5.65) for IM (P = .29), and 5.51 (2.92-10.39) versus 14.80 (5.87-37.28) for dysplasia (P = .08). There were no differences for progression of AG between groups when high-quality studies were compared. Similar progression rates of IM and dysplasia were observed among low and medium/high GC incidence countries. This suggests that the potential benefits of surveillance for these lesions in low-risk regions may be comparable with those of population-wide interventions in high-risk regions. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and inform global screening and surveillance guidelines.",Hahn AI; Mülder DT; Huang RJ; Zhou MJ; Blake B; Omofuma O; Murphy JD; Gutiérrez-Torres DS; Zauber AG; O'Mahony JF; Camargo MC; Ladabaum U; Yeh JM; Hur C; Lansdorp-Vogelaar I; Meester R; Laszkowska M,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39362617/,0,1,0,1,0,0
39347933,Imaging colonic polyps in 2024.,"Screening colonoscopy and polypectomy are the cornerstone in decreasing the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer. Despite the low incidence of colorectal cancer in India, there has been a rising trend in the incidence of colonic polyps and cancer over the last decade. It is, hence, imperative that we are well equipped in the management of colonic polyps. Adequate training in the detection and characterization of polyps to aid in their management is necessary. Detection of polyps can be increased by adhering to the standards of colonoscopy, including good bowel preparation, cecal intubation rate, adequate withdrawal time and use of distal attachment devices. A detected polyp needs optimal characterization to predict histology in real time and decide on the management strategies. Characterization of the polyps requires high-definition-white light endoscopy and/or image-enhanced endoscopy (dye based or digital). Various factors that help in predicting histology include size, location and morphology of the polyp and the pit pattern, vascular and surface pattern of the polyp. Polyps can be differentiated as neoplastic or non-neoplastic with reasonable accuracy with the above features. Prediction of advanced pathology including high-grade dysplasia and deep sub-mucosal invasion is essential, as it helps in deciding if the lesion is amenable to endotherapy and the technique of endoscopic resection. Adequate training in image-enhanced endoscopy is necessary to assess advanced pathology in polyps. Technology pertaining to image-enhanced endoscopy includes narrow banding imaging and blue laser imaging; newer variations are being introduced every few years making it necessary to be abreast with growing information. The recent advances in gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy with the advent of endocytoscopy and artificial intelligence seem promising and are predicted to be the future of GI endoscopy.",Nagarajan KV; Bhat N,Indian journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Indian Society of Gastroenterology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39347933/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39347570,The human gut microbiome in health and disease: time for a new chapter?,"The gut microbiome, composed of the colonic microbiota and their host environment, is important for many aspects of human health. A gut microbiome imbalance (gut dysbiosis) is associated with major causes of human morbidity and mortality. Despite the central part our gut microbiome plays in health and disease, mechanisms that maintain homeostasis and properties that demarcate dysbiosis remain largely undefined. Here we discuss that sorting taxa into meaningful ecological units reveals that the availability of respiratory electron acceptors, such as oxygen, in the host environment has a dominant influence on gut microbiome health. During homeostasis, host functions that limit the diffusion of oxygen into the colonic lumen shelter a microbial community dominated by primary fermenters from atmospheric oxygen. In turn, primary fermenters break down unabsorbed nutrients into fermentation products that support host nutrition. This symbiotic relationship is disrupted when host functions that limit the luminal availability of host-derived electron acceptors become weakened. The resulting changes in the host environment drive alterations in the microbiota composition, which feature an elevated abundance of facultatively anaerobic microbes. Thus, the part of the gut microbiome that becomes imbalanced during dysbiosis is the host environment, whereas changes in the microbiota composition are secondary to this underlying cause. This shift in our understanding of dysbiosis provides a novel starting point for therapeutic strategies to restore microbiome health. Such strategies can either target the microbes through metabolism-based editing or strengthen the host functions that control their environment.",Lee J-Y; Bays DJ; Savage HP; Bäumler AJ,Infection and immunity,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39347570/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39343045,The effect of raloxifene supplementation on blood pressure and Apo-lipoproteins in postmenopausal women: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Several studies indicated the ameliorating effects of raloxifene supplementation on apolipoproteins and blood pressure, although others have conflicting findings. Therefore, the present study was conducted in order to accurately and definitively understands the effect of raloxifene on apolipoprotein AI (Apo-AI), apolipoprotein B (APoB), lipoprotein (a) (Lp (a)), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in postmenopausal women. A systematic literature search was conducted using scientific databases including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science and the Cochrane Library, through May 2024. The quality of studies was assessed using Cochrane tool. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95 % CI for the outcomes. Twenty trials, with interventions ranging from 6 to 144 weeks and 2825 participants, were included. Raloxifene supplementation demonstrated significant reductions in ApoB (SMD: -0.92; 95 % CI: -1.49 to -0.35; P = 0.001), and Lp (a) (SMD: -0.25; 95 % CI: -0.39 to -0.11; P < 0.001) while increasing Apo-AI levels (SMD: 0.29; 95 % CI: 0.22-0.36; P < 0.001). Conversely, no significant effects were observed on SBP (WMD: -0.49 mmHg; 95 % CI: -3.01-2.04; P = 0.706), and DBP (WMD: -0.81 mmHg; 95 % CI: -4.04-2.41; P = 0.621). Moreover, subgroup analysis indicated that raloxifene significantly decreased DBP in studies with intervention durations of >12 weeks.

39338635,Applications of Artificial Intelligence for Heat Stress Management in Ruminant Livestock.,"Heat stress impacts ruminant livestock production on varied levels in this alarming climate breakdown scenario. The drastic effects of the global climate change-associated heat stress in ruminant livestock demands constructive evaluation of animal performance bordering on effective monitoring systems. In this climate-smart digital age, adoption of advanced and developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies is gaining traction for efficient heat stress management. AI has widely penetrated the climate sensitive ruminant livestock sector due to its promising and plausible scope in assessing production risks and the climate resilience of ruminant livestock. Significant improvement has been achieved alongside the adoption of novel AI algorithms to evaluate the performance of ruminant livestock. These AI-powered tools have the robustness and competence to expand the evaluation of animal performance and help in minimising the production losses associated with heat stress in ruminant livestock. Advanced heat stress management through automated monitoring of heat stress in ruminant livestock based on behaviour, physiology and animal health responses have been widely accepted due to the evolution of technologies like machine learning (ML), neural networks and deep learning (DL). The AI-enabled tools involving automated data collection, pre-processing, data wrangling, development of appropriate algorithms, and deployment of models assist the livestock producers in decision-making based on real-time monitoring and act as early-stage warning systems to forecast disease dynamics based on prediction models. Due to the convincing performance, precision, and accuracy of AI models, the climate-smart livestock production imbibes AI technologies for scaled use in the successful reducing of heat stress in ruminant livestock, thereby ensuring sustainable livestock production and safeguarding the global economy.",Rebez EB; Sejian V; Silpa MV; Kalaignazhal G; Thirunavukkarasu D; Devaraj C; Nikhil KT; Ninan J; Sahoo A; Lacetera N; Dunshea FR,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39338635/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39337868,Prenatal Nutritional Factors and Neurodevelopmental Disorders: A Narrative Review.,"According to the DSM-5, neurodevelopmental disorders represent a group of heterogeneous conditions, with onset during the developmental period, characterized by an alteration of communication and social skills, learning, adaptive behavior, executive functions, and psychomotor skills. These deficits determine an impairment of personal, social, scholastic, or occupational functioning. Neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by an increased incidence and a multifactorial etiology, including genetic and environmental components. Data largely explain the role of genetic and environmental factors, also through epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and miRNA. Despite genetic factors, nutritional factors also play a significant role in the pathophysiology of these disorders, both in the prenatal and postnatal period, underscoring that the control of modifiable factors could decrease the incidence of neurodevelopmental disorders. The preventive role of nutrition is widely studied as regards many chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and cancer, but actually we also know the effects of nutrition on embryonic brain development and the influence of prenatal and preconceptional nutrition in predisposition to various pathologies. These factors are not limited only to a correct caloric intake and a good BMI, but rather to an adequate and balanced intake of macro and micronutrients, the type of diet, and other elements such as exposure to heavy metals. This review represents an analysis of the literature as regards the physiopathological mechanisms by which food influences our state of health, especially in the age of development (from birth to adolescence), through prenatal and preconceptional changes, underlying how controlling these nutritional factors should improve mothers' nutritional state to significantly reduce the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring. We searched key words such as ""maternal nutrition and neurodevelopmental disorders"" on Pubmed and Google Scholar, selecting the main reviews and excluding individual cases. Therefore, nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics teach us the importance of personalized nutrition for good health. So future perspectives may include well-established reference values in order to determine the correct nutritional intake of mothers through food and integration.",Cernigliaro F; Santangelo A; Nardello R; Lo Cascio S; D'Agostino S; Correnti E; Marchese F; Pitino R; Valdese S; Rizzo C; Raieli V; Santangelo G,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39337868/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39332772,A Systematic Review on the Impact of Plant-Based Milk Consumption on Growth and Nutrition in Children and Adolescents.,"Children are increasingly consuming plant-based milks, yet the impact on their growth and nutrition is unclear. This systematic review aimed to summarize the available evidence on the impact of plant-based milk consumption on growth and nutrition in children and adolescents. MEDLINE, Embase (Excerpta Medica Database), EBM Reviews - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Child Development and Adolescent Studies, and Scopus were comprehensively searched from 2000 to 2024 to identify studies evaluating the growth and nutritional effects of plant-based milk consumption in children aged 1-18 y. Two reviewers independently screened full-text articles, assessed their quality, and extracted data. A total of 6 studies were identified: 3 cross-sectional studies, 1 prospective cohort study, and 2 clinical trials (total n = 15,815). Observational studies found that consumption of plant-based milk was associated with lower childhood body mass index (BMI), height, and serum vitamin D concentrations compared with cow milk. No association was found between soy milk consumption and BMI in adolescent girls. Low-quality clinical trials showed minimal effects on growth, and 1 study found that adolescent girls with low calcium intake who consumed fortified soy milk had higher bone density compared with those who did not consume soy milk. Available evidence suggests that children who consume plant-based milk may have lower BMI, height, and micronutrient intake compared with those who consume cow milk, whereas fortified soy milk may support bone health in adolescents who do not drink cow milk. Longitudinal studies and randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether these associations persist over time, differ between children and adolescents or among those who consume soy milk, and to understand the potential underlying mechanisms. This trial was registered at PROSPERO as CRD42022367269.",Soczynska I; da Costa BR; O'Connor DL; Jenkins DJ; Birken CS; Keown-Stoneman CD; D'Hollander C; Calleja S; Maguire JL,The Journal of nutrition,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39332772/,0,1,0,0,0,1
39331531,Exhaustive Search of Dietary Intake Biomarkers as Objective Tools for Personalized Nutrimetabolomics and Precision Nutrition Implementation.,"To conduct an exhaustive scoping search of existing literature, incorporating diverse bibliographic sources to elucidate the relationships between metabolite biomarkers in human fluids and dietary intake. The search for biomarkers linked to specific dietary food intake holds immense significance for precision health and nutrition research. Using objective methods to track food consumption through metabolites offers a more accurate way to provide dietary advice and prescriptions on healthy dietary patterns by healthcare professionals. An extensive investigation was conducted on biomarkers associated with the consumption of several food groups and consumption patterns. Evidence is integrated from observational studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses to achieve precision nutrition and metabolism personalization. Tailored search strategies were applied across databases and gray literature, yielding 158 primary research articles that met strict inclusion criteria. The collected data underwent rigorous analysis using STATA and Python tools. Biomarker-food associations were categorized into 5 groups: cereals and grains, dairy products, protein-rich foods, plant-based foods, and a miscellaneous group. Specific cutoff points (≥3 or ≥4 bibliographic appearances) were established to identify reliable biomarkers indicative of dietary consumption. Key metabolites in plasma, serum, and urine revealed intake from different food groups. For cereals and grains, 3-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl) propanoic acid glucuronide and 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid were significant. Omega-3 fatty acids and specific amino acids showcased dairy and protein foods consumption. Nuts and seafood were linked to hypaphorine and trimethylamine N-oxide. The miscellaneous group featured compounds like theobromine, 7-methylxanthine, caffeine, quinic acid, paraxanthine, and theophylline associated with coffee intake. Data collected from this research demonstrate potential for incorporating precision nutrition into clinical settings and nutritional advice based on accurate estimation of food intake. By customizing dietary recommendations based on individualized metabolic profiles, this approach could significantly improve personalized food consumption health prescriptions and support integrating multiple nutritional data.This article is part of a Nutrition Reviews special collection on Precision Nutrition.",de la O V; Fernández-Cruz E; Valdés A; Cifuentes A; Walton J; Martínez JA,Nutrition reviews,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39331531/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39305854,Perspectives for reproduction and production in grazing sheep and cattle in Australasia: The next 20 years.,"We offer a perspective on the major challenges that are confronting the management of reproduction in sheep and cattle in Australia and New Zealand, over the next two decades. An important context is the dominance of grazing systems in which large flocks or herds are managed over large areas where it is challenging to manage reproduction with precision. Consequently, the variable forage supply usually dominates reproductive outcomes, a problem that will be exacerbated by global heating. Thus, in extensive grazing systems, there is a great need for technological solutions to improve the management of nutrition. Global heating will also exert direct effects on reproductive function. Therefore, for the foreseeable future, reproduction will remain a focus for industry. In addition, as the industries develop, we foresee continued societal pressure to reduce medication, mitigate environmental damage, and improve animal well-being. Management solutions for extensive grazing systems must involve minimal interventions with the animals and be applicable to diverse genotypes and environments. Clearly, genetics and breeding will be at the heart of solutions and elegant strategies will be needed that focus on developing animals that are robust, if perhaps a little less productive. A high rate of genetic gain is the main reason for pursuing reproductive technologies, but highly advanced reproductive technology is not likely to be the best fit in extensive management systems. Even for AI, the simplest technology, uptake is limited and lateral thinking is needed to find ways to improve the rates of genetic gain. We conclude that there are many opportunities for improving reproductive performance in sheep and cattle in Australia and New Zealand. As we gain deeper understanding of the processes involved, we should be able to make progress in fertility and fecundity, embryo survival, and postnatal survival. Improvements in reproductive performance will increase productivity, and should also be associated with significantly improved animal well-being and a reduction in methane emissions intensity. To capture these benefits, the development of new management options will require lateral thinking about reproductive technology for extensive grazing systems, and a transdisciplinary approach that brings together the systems biology of grazing animals with an understanding of the barriers to adoption by farmers.",Martin GB; Fordyce G; McGowan MR; Juengel JL,Theriogenology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39305854/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39303733,Computer-aided diagnosis for the resect-and-discard strategy for colorectal polyps: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The resect-and-discard strategy allows endoscopists to replace post-polypectomy pathology with real-time prediction of polyp histology during colonoscopy (optical diagnosis). We aimed to investigate the benefits and harms of implementing computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) for polyp pathology into the resect-and-discard strategy. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus from database inception to June 5, 2024, without language restrictions, for diagnostic accuracy studies that assessed the performance of real-time CADx systems, compared with histology, for the optical diagnosis of diminutive polyps (≤5 mm) in the entire colon. We synthesised data for three strategies: CADx-alone, CADx-unassisted, and CADx-assisted; when the endoscopist was involved in the optical diagnosis, we synthesised data exclusively from diagnoses for which confidence in the prediction was reported as high. The primary outcomes were the proportion of polyps that would have avoided pathological assessment (ie, the proportion optically diagnosed with high confidence; main benefit) and the proportion of polyps incorrectly predicted due to false positives and false negatives (main harm), directly compared between CADx-assisted and CADx-unassisted strategies. We used DerSimonian and Laird's random-effects model to calculate all outcomes. We used Higgins I<sup>2</sup> to assess heterogeneity, the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to rate certainty, and funnel plots and Egger's test to examine publication bias. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42024508440. We found 1019 studies, of which 11 (7400 diminutive polyps, 3769 patients, and 185 endoscopists) were included in the final meta-analysis. Three studies (1817 patients and 4086 polyps [2148 neoplastic and 1938 non-neoplastic]) provided data to directly compare the primary outcome measures between the CADx-unassisted and CADx-assisted strategies. We found no significant difference between the CADx-assisted and CADx-unassisted strategies for the proportion of polyps that would have avoided pathological assessment (90% [88-93], 3653 [89·4%] of 4086 polyps diagnosed with high confidence vs 90% [95% CI 85-94], 3588 [87·8%] of 4086 polyps diagnosed with high confidence; risk ratio 1·01 [95% CI 0·99-1·04; I<sup>2</sup>=53·49%; low-certainty evidence; Egger's test p=0·18). The proportion of incorrectly predicted polyps was lower with the CADx-assisted strategy than with the CADx-unassisted strategy (12% [95% CI 7-17], 523 [14·3%] of 3653 polyps incorrectly predicted with a CADx-assisted strategy vs 13% [6-20], 582 [16·2%] of 3588 polyps incorrectly diagnosed with a CADx-unassisted strategy; risk ratio 0·88 [95% CI 0·79-0·98]; I<sup>2</sup>=0·00%; low-certainty evidence; Egger's test p=0·18). CADx did not produce benefit nor harm for the resect-and-discard strategy, questioning its value in clinical practice. Improving the accuracy and explainability of CADx is desired.

39295087,Ultrasound for assessing paediatric body composition and nutritional status: Scoping review and future directions.,"This scoping review aims to assess the utility of ultrasound as a prospective tool in measuring body composition and nutritional status in the paediatric population. We provide a comprehensive summary of the existing literature, identify gaps, and propose future research directions. We conducted a systematic scoping review following the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. This involved screening titles and abstracts of relevant studies, followed by a detailed full-text review and extraction of pertinent data. We identified and synthesised 34 articles. The review revealed that while ultrasound has been used to assess body composition and bone properties in children, significant gaps remain in the literature. These include limited studies on ultrasound performance, insufficient attention to relevant sample characteristics, reliance on manual image measurements, and limited sample diversity. Point-of-care ultrasound shows significant promise for assessing paediatric body composition and nutritional status. To validate and enhance its effectiveness, further research is needed. Future studies should include larger and more diverse patient cohorts and conduct longitudinal investigations to evaluate nutritional interventions. Additionally, developing artificial intelligence (AI) for standardising and automating data interpretation will be crucial in improving the accuracy and efficiency of ultrasound assessments.",Ranger BJ; Lombardi A; Kwon S; Loeb M; Cho H; He K; Wei D; Park J,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39295087/,0,0,0,0,0,1
39286363,Induction of puberty <i>vs.</i> induction of ovulation using steroid hormones in beef heifers: a comprehensive review.,"This review elucidates the physiological and endocrinological processes intrinsic to puberty and ovulation induction protocols in <i>Bos indicus</i> and <i>Bos taurus</i> beef heifers. Puberty is a complex physiological event involving gonadotropic and metabolic changes that lead to sexual maturity, first ovulation, and regular reproductive cycles, enabling females to reproduce. Exposure to progesterone-based hormonal protocols, with or without additional hormones, can reduce the age at first ovulation and improve sexual maturity through stimuli in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and uterine development. However, inducing puberty differs from inducing ovulation, as it does not ensure the heifer will continue cycling or be ready to establish and maintain pregnancy after hormonal exposure. Regardless of the pharmacological basis, studies consistently report that beef heifers that had a corpus luteum (CL) prior to the timed-artificial insemination (TAI) protocol, have greater expression of estrus in response to synchronization and greater pregnancy per AI compared to heifers without a CL. The combination of P4 and E2 significantly impacts uterine development, increasing reproductive efficiency. Exposure to P4 causes a positive effect on inducing ovulation. However, studies indicate that the addition of E2 esters at the time of P4 device removal increases the ovulation rate. In general, the studies showed that fertility varied according to the type of the ovulation induction protocol used, but with inconsistent results. Although ovulation induction protocols are strategic tools to accelerate sexual maturity, a holistic view of the entire system is extremely important, combining integration with genetics and nutrition to enhance the reproductive outcomes of beef heifers. Future research is needed to understand and refine these protocols, driving the efficiency of beef cattle production systems.",Sartori R; Alves RLOR; Lopes ALM,Animal reproduction,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39286363/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39281983,Management of Bone Loss in Revision Total Knee Arthroplasty: An International Consensus Symposium.,"The evaluation, classification, and treatment of significant bone loss after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) continue to be a complex and debated topic in revision TKA (rTKA). Despite the introduction of new evidence and innovative technologies aimed at addressing the approach and care of severe bone loss in rTKA, there is no single document that systematically incorporates these newer surgical approaches. Therefore, a comprehensive review of the treatment of severe bone loss in rTKA is necessary. The Stavros Niarchos Foundation Complex Joint Reconstruction Center Hospital for Special Surgery, dedicated to clinical care and research primarily in revision hip and knee replacement, convened a Management of Bone Loss in Revision TKA symposium on June 24, 2022. At this meeting, the 42 international invited experts were divided into groups; each group was assigned to discuss questions related to 1 of the 4 topics: (1) assessing preoperative workup and imaging, anticipated bone loss, classification system, and implant surveillance; (2) achieving durable fixation in the setting of significant bone loss in revision TKA; (3) managing patellar bone loss and the extensor mechanism in cases of severe bone loss; and (4) considering the use of complex modular replacement systems: hinges, distal femoral, and proximal tibial replacements.

Food-based VLEDs are an alternative approach, but it is uncertain whether they can provide adequate nutrition within an 800 kcal/day restriction. This analysis aimed to assess the nutritional adequacy of food-based VLEDs compared with formula VLEDs. A systematized literature review was conducted to identify balanced food-based VLEDs by searching five scientific databases from inception to 23 March 2023 and online sources between 1 and 7 May 2023. Ultimately, nine diets were analyzed for nutritional content and compared with <i>Codex Alimentarius</i> standards for formula foods, and Australian estimated average requirement and adequate intake (AI) for adults 19-50 years. Optifast<sup>®</sup> was used as a comparator. None of the VLEDs met all nutritional benchmarks. Three food-based diets had nutrient profiles similar to formula VLEDs, with one being adequate for all nutrients except thiamine, magnesium and zinc in men and iron in women. All VLEDs, including Optifast<sup>®</sup>, did not meet AI for dietary fiber, except one. In general, food-based VLEDs offered more fiber than Optifast<sup>®</sup>. In conclusion, food-based VLEDs were inadequate in certain micronutrients but offered more dietary fiber than formula VLEDs. These nutritional deficits do not preclude food-based VLEDs from being recommended, provided they are addressed.",Poon SWY; Brown RM; Sumithran P,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39275308/,0,1,0,0,0,0
39269377,Submucosal injection fluid and tattoo agents.,"EMR and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) are minimally invasive endoscopic techniques, developed for the removal of benign and early malignant lesions throughout the GI tract. Submucosal injection of a marking agent can help to identify lesions during surgery. Endoscopic resection frequently involves ""lifting"" of the lesions by injection of a substance within the submucosal space to create a cushion for safe resection. This review summarizes the current techniques and agents available for endoscopic marking and lifting of GI tract lesions. The MEDLINE database was searched through April 2023 for relevant articles related to the lifting and marking aspect of EMR by using key words such as ""endoscopy"" or ""endoscopic"" combined with ""marking,"" ""tattoo,"" and ""lifting.""

Studies have reported low bone mineral density (BMD) in mixed-age PKU populations, possibly related to long-term Phe restriction. Therefore, a meta-analysis investigating BMD specifically in adults with PKU was conducted. Studies reporting BMD-related outcomes were identified from a systematic literature review evaluating somatic comorbidities experienced by adults with PKU on a Phe-restricted diet (searched February 1, 2022, updated November 1, 2023). Risk of study bias was assessed (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network checklists). The primary outcome of the meta-analysis was pooled mean BMD Z-scores of different bones. Secondary outcomes were the prevalence of low BMD Z-scores at pre-specified thresholds. Subgroup analyses of mean BMD Z-scores (decade of study publication, controlled versus uncontrolled blood Phe levels, gender) were conducted. BMD-related data from 4097 individuals across 10 studies rated as at least acceptable quality were included. Mean BMD Z-scores were statistically significantly lower compared with an age-matched control or reference (non-PKU) population, across bones, but still within the expected range for age (> -2.0): lumbar spine (seven studies, n = 304), -0.63 (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.74, -0.52); femoral neck (four studies, n = 170), -0.74 (95% CI: -1.25, -0.22); radius (three studies, n = 114), -0.77 (95% CI: -1.21, -0.32); total body (four studies, n = 157), -0.61 (95% CI: -0.77, -0.45). The small number of observations in the subgroup analyses resulted in a high degree of uncertainty, limiting interpretation. Estimated prevalence of BMD Z-scores ≤ -2.0 was 8% (95% CI: 5%, 13%; four studies, n = 221) and < -1.0 was 42% (95% CI: 35%, 51%; five studies, n = 144). Adults with PKU had lower BMD Z-scores than the reference (non-PKU) population but < 1 in 10 were below the expected range for age. The low number of studies prevents identification of which population characteristics are most impacting BMD.

However, their consumption has sparked debate regarding their health benefits and production concerns. The purpose of this review was to map existing evidence on the health benefits and challenges associated with the consumption of tropical oils. The recommendations for conducting a scoping review by Arksey and O'Malley were followed. PubMed, Dimensions AI, Central, JSTOR Google, Google Scholar, and ProQuest databases were searched for relevant papers. The predetermined keywords used were Consumption"" AND ""Tropical oil,"" as well as ""Health benefits"" OR ""Health challenges"" AND ""Tropical Countries."" Peer-reviewed and grey literature published in English were eligible for this review. Tropical oils, such as palm and coconut oils, provide health benefits including essential vitamins (A and E) that enhance ocular health, boost immunity, and support growth. They are also recognised for their role in managing high blood sugar, obesity, and cholesterol levels, while offering antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. These oils have wound-healing abilities and are commonly used in infant nutrition and traditional cooking. Nevertheless, prolonged and repeated use of tropical oils to high temperature can degrade vitamin E, whereas excessive intake may result in overdose. Health concerns include oxidative risks, diabetes, cancer, coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, and acrylamide formation due to production challenges excessive consumption. Additional issues include obesity, suboptimal oil production, misconceptions, regulatory obstacles, and preferences for alternative fats. This review suggest that tropical oils provide essential health benefits, including vitamins and antioxidant properties, but pose significant health risks and production challenges, particularly when exposed to high temperatures and through excessive intake. Guidelines on the consumption of tropical oils in the tropical regions are necessary to regulate their consumption.",Hormenu T; Salifu I; Paku JE; Kordowu PY; Abdul-Karim A; Gyan TB; Asiedu I; Abdul-Ganiyu O; Amoadu M,BMC public health,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39256687/,0,0,0,0,0,0

39225782,Eating for Optimization: Unraveling the Dietary Patterns and Nutritional Strategies in Endometriosis Management.,"Endometriosis is a chronic gynecological disorder affecting millions of women worldwide, causing chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, and infertility, and severely impacting their quality of life. Treatment primarily involves hormonal therapies and surgical excision, but high recurrence rates and the economic burden are substantial. With these challenges, significant discussion surrounds the potential role of dietary patterns in managing endometriosis, making it necessary to bridge this critical gap. This review investigates the current scientific evidence on the dietary patterns (eg, Mediterranean, vegetarian, anti-inflammatory, low-fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols [low-FODMAP], and Western-style diets) associated with endometriosis and provides a concise, yet thorough, overview on the subject. In addition, antioxidants, microbiota, and artificial intelligence (AI) and their potential roles were also evaluated as future directions. An electronic-based search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, Scopus, and Web of Science. The current data on the topic indicate that a diet based on the Mediterranean and anti-inflammatory diet pattern, rich in dietary fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, plant-based protein, and vitamins and minerals, has a positive influence on endometriosis, yielding a promising improvement in patient symptoms. Preclinical investigations and clinical trials indicate that dietary antioxidants and gut microbiota modulation present potential new approaches in managing endometriosis. Also, AI may offer a promising avenue to explore how dietary components interact with endometriosis. Ultimately, considering genetic and lifestyle factors, a healthy, balanced, personalized approach to diet may offer valuable insights on the role of diet as a means of symptom improvement, facilitating the utilization of nutrition for the management of endometriosis.",Türkoğlu İ; Sacinti KG; Panattoni A; Namazov A; Sanlier NT; Sanlier N; Cela V,Nutrition reviews,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39225782/,1,0,0,0,0,0

39210026,The genetic landscape of neuro-related proteins in human plasma.,"Understanding the genetic basis of neuro-related proteins is essential for dissecting the molecular basis of human behavioural traits and the disease aetiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. Here the SCALLOP Consortium conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis of over 12,000 individuals for 184 neuro-related proteins in human plasma. The analysis identified 125 cis-regulatory protein quantitative trait loci (cis-pQTL) and 164 trans-pQTL. The mapped pQTL capture on average 50% of each protein's heritability. At the cis-pQTL, multiple proteins shared a genetic basis with human behavioural traits such as alcohol and food intake, smoking and educational attainment, as well as neurological conditions and psychiatric disorders such as pain, neuroticism and schizophrenia.

39207880,Decoding the Foodome: Molecular Networks Connecting Diet and Health.,"Diet, a modifiable risk factor, plays a pivotal role in most diseases, from cardiovascular disease to type 2 diabetes mellitus, cancer, and obesity. However, our understanding of the mechanistic role of the chemical compounds found in food remains incomplete. In this review, we explore the ""dark matter"" of nutrition, going beyond the macro- and micronutrients documented by national databases to unveil the exceptional chemical diversity of food composition. We also discuss the need to explore the impact of each compound in the presence of associated chemicals and relevant food sources and describe the tools that will allow us to do so. Finally, we discuss the role of network medicine in understanding the mechanism of action of each food molecule. Overall, we illustrate the important role of network science and artificial intelligence in our ability to reveal nutrition's multifaceted role in health and disease.",Menichetti G; Barabási AL; Loscalzo J,Annual review of nutrition,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39207880/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39203738,Artificial Intelligence and Health Inequities in Dietary Interventions on Atherosclerosis: A Narrative Review.,"Poor diet is the top modifiable mortality risk factor globally, accounting for 11 million deaths annually with half being from diet-linked atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Yet, most of the world cannot afford a healthy diet-as the hidden costs of the inadequate global food system total over USD 13 trillion annually-let alone the much more clinically, financially, and ecologically costly and resource-intensive medical interventions required to address the disease progression and acute complications of ASCVD. Yet, AI is increasingly understood as a force multiplying revolutionary technology which may catalyze multi-sector efforts in medicine and public health to better address these significant health challenges. This novel narrative review seeks to provide the first known overview of the state-of-the-art in clinical interventions and public health policies in healthy diets for ASCVD, accelerated by health equity-focused AI. It is written from the first-hand practitioner perspective to provide greater relevance and applicability for health professionals and data scientists. The review summarizes the emerging trends and leading use cases in population health risk stratification and precision public health, AI democratizing clinical diagnosis, digital twins in precision nutrition, and AI-enabled culinary medicine as medical education and treatment. This review may, therefore, help inform and advance the evidence-based foundation for more clinically effective, financially efficient, and societally equitable dietary and nutrition interventions for ASCVD.",Monlezun DJ; MacKay K,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39203738/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39201229,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and the Internet of Things: A Scoping Review.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent endocrine disorder impacting women's health and quality of life. This scoping review explores the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) in PCOS management. Results were grouped into six domains of the IoT: mobile apps, social media, wearables, machine learning, websites, and phone-based. A further domain was created to capture participants' perspectives on using the IoT in PCOS management. Mobile apps appear to be useful for menstrual cycle tracking, symptom recording, and education. Despite concerns regarding the quality and reliability of social media content, these platforms may play an important role in disseminating PCOS-related information. Wearables facilitate detailed symptom monitoring and improve communication with healthcare providers. Machine learning algorithms show promising results in PCOS diagnosis accuracy, risk prediction, and app development. Although abundant, PCOS-related content on websites may lack quality and cultural considerations. While patients express concerns about online misinformation, they consider online forums valuable for peer connection. Using text messages and phone calls to provide feedback and support to PCOS patients may help them improve lifestyle behaviors and self-management skills. Advancing evidence-based, culturally sensitive, and accessible IoT solutions can enhance their potential to transform PCOS care, address misinformation, and empower women to better manage their symptoms.",Graca S; Alloh F; Lagojda L; Dallaway A; Kyrou I; Randeva HS; Kite C,"Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39201229/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39199690,"Long Non-Coding RNAs, Nuclear Receptors and Their Cross-Talks in Cancer-Implications and Perspectives.","Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play key roles in various epigenetic and post-transcriptional events in the cell, thereby significantly influencing cellular processes including gene expression, development and diseases such as cancer. Nuclear receptors (NRs) are a family of ligand-regulated transcription factors that typically regulate transcription of genes involved in a broad spectrum of cellular processes, immune responses and in many diseases including cancer. Owing to their many overlapping roles as modulators of gene expression, the paths traversed by lncRNA and NR-mediated signaling often cross each other; these lncRNA-NR cross-talks are being increasingly recognized as important players in many cellular processes and diseases such as cancer. Here, we review the individual roles of lncRNAs and NRs, especially growth factor modulated receptors such as androgen receptors (ARs), in various types of cancers and how the cross-talks between lncRNAs and NRs are involved in cancer progression and metastasis. We discuss the challenges involved in characterizing lncRNA-NR associations and how to overcome them. Furthering our understanding of the mechanisms of lncRNA-NR associations is crucial to realizing their potential as prognostic features, diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer biology.",Tiwari P; Tripathi LP,Cancers,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39199690/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39181829,Effect of Raloxifene Treatment on Apolipoproteins and Lipoprotein(a) Concentrations in Postmenopausal Women: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"Although various randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated the effect of raloxifene on apolipoproteins and lipoprotein(a) concentrations in postmenopausal women, the results have been inconsistent and inconclusive. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis of RCTs to investigate the effect of raloxifene administration on apolipoproteins and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations in postmenopausal women. Two independent researchers systematically searched the scientific literature (including PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and EMBASE) for English-language randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to June 2024. We included RCTs reporting the impact of raloxifene on apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I), apolipoprotein B (ApoB), and Lp(a) levels in postmenopausal women. The primary outcome of interest was change in Lp(a), and the secondary outcomes were changes in ApoA-I and ApoB. The present meta-analysis incorporated 12 publications with 14 RCT arms. The comprehensive outcomes derived from the random-effects model revealed a statistically significant increase in ApoA-I (WMD: 6.06 mg/dL, 95% CI: 4.38, 7.75, P < 0.001) and decrease in ApoB concentrations (WMD: -8.48 mg/dL, 95% CI: -10.60, -6.36, P < 0.001) and Lp(a) (WMD: -3.02 mg/dL, 95% CI: -4.83, -1.21, P < 0.001) following the administration of raloxifene in postmenopausal women. In the subgroup analyses, the increase in ApoA-I and the decrease in ApoB and Lp(a) levels were greater in RCTs with a mean participant age of ≥60 years and a duration of ≤12 weeks. The current meta-analysis of RCTs demonstrates that treatment with raloxifene reduces ApoB and Lp(a) levels while increasing ApoA-I levels in postmenopausal women. Since these effects on lipid components are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), raloxifene could be a suitable therapy for postmenopausal women who are at an increased risk of CVD and have other medical indications for raloxifene administration.",Liao X; Deng J; Du L; Hernández-Wolters B; Prabahar K; Kord-Varkaneh H,Clinical therapeutics,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39181829/,0,1,0,1,0,0
39177534,Informatics-driven solutions for optimal care delivery in liver transplantation.,"Clinical informatics, which combines health information technology and clinical expertise, aims to improve health care delivery and outcomes. For candidates and recipients of liver transplants, the complexities of their management are vast. Care often involves significant volumes of data from various sources and multiple health care settings and health care systems. Informatics represents an opportunity to support the care of these patients through this process; however, it has been underutilized to date. Preliminary examples of informatics use exist for this patient population, such as clinical decision support to link patients to hepatology providers, utilization of digital health technologies to track responses to medical therapy, and artificial intelligence to characterize organ donor compatibility. Further deployment of these tools can optimize care delivery for patients with cirrhosis and across the transplant cascade. In this review, we explore the utility of various techniques of clinical informatics mainly within the transplant care cascade, barriers to implementation, and highlight opportunities for future investigation and optimized use. Although barriers to widespread adoption remain such as interoperability, data access and availability, and structured implementation strategies, the integration of informatics and clinical decision support/artificial intelligence-based tools into routine care for liver transplantation represents an opportunity for marked enhancement in how we deliver care to these patients.",Spann A; Louissaint J; Izzy M,Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39177534/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39176894,Healthcare LLMs Go to Market: A Realist Review of Product Launch News.,"We provide a realist review of product launches for Large Language Models (LLMs) in the healthcare industry. Through a systematic search in the Factiva database and the application of a Context, Intervention, Mechanism, Outcome (CIMO) framework, we identified and assessed 23 significant records, representing 17 unique product launches between January 2023 and February 2024. This manuscript contributes to the emerging literature on health LLMs and Generative AI by focusing on actual product launches of healthcare LLM products-a less explored aspect than theoretical potential. Our use of the CIMO framework to dissect the application of LLMs in healthcare adds a fresh perspective to the discourse, helping to understand the outcomes and the mechanisms driving these outcomes. Among the LLM application themes that emerged from our review, we focused on four primary themes: Clinical Care and Health Services, Healthcare Documentation and Data Management, Insurance and Healthcare Financial Services, and Nutrition, Wellness, and Chronic Disease Management. Our findings demonstrate LLMs' potential to transform patient care through personalization and efficiency, highlighting their role in enhancing healthcare delivery systems, reducing administrative burdens, and supporting decision-making processes. Specific implementations by health start-ups and large tech firms discussed in this paper underscore the immediate impact of these technologies on patient care and healthcare management. This realist model offers a new perspective on LLMs within healthcare, providing an empirical basis for future technological integration and policy development in digital health. Our study contributes to understanding how LLMs operate within the healthcare sector, emphasizing the importance of context in their successful deployment and serving as a strategic guide for future AI integration in sensitive healthcare services.",Sharifi S; Namvar M; Intezari A; Akhlaghpour S,Studies in health technology and informatics,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39176894/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39169353,A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials of substituting soymilk for cow's milk and intermediate cardiometabolic outcomes: understanding the impact of dairy alternatives in the transition to plant-based diets on cardiometabolic health.,"Dietary guidelines recommend a shift to plant-based diets. Fortified soymilk, a prototypical plant protein food used in the transition to plant-based diets, usually contains added sugars to match the sweetness of cow's milk and is classified as an ultra-processed food. Whether soymilk can replace minimally processed cow's milk without the adverse cardiometabolic effects attributed to added sugars and ultra-processed foods remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, to assess the effect of substituting soymilk for cow's milk and its modification by added sugars (sweetened versus unsweetened) on intermediate cardiometabolic outcomes. MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched (through June 2024) for randomized controlled trials of ≥ 3 weeks in adults. Outcomes included established markers of blood lipids, glycemic control, blood pressure, inflammation, adiposity, renal disease, uric acid, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. The certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation). A sub-study of lactose versus sucrose outside of a dairy-like matrix was conducted to explore the role of sweetened soymilk which followed the same methodology. Eligibility criteria were met by 17 trials (n = 504 adults with a range of health statuses), assessing the effect of a median daily dose of 500 mL of soymilk (22 g soy protein and 17.2 g or 6.9 g/250 mL added sugars) in substitution for 500 mL of cow's milk (24 g milk protein and 24 g or 12 g/250 mL total sugars as lactose) on 19 intermediate outcomes. The substitution of soymilk for cow's milk resulted in moderate reductions in non-HDL-C (mean difference, - 0.26 mmol/L [95% confidence interval, - 0.43 to - 0.10]), systolic blood pressure (- 8.00 mmHg [- 14.89 to - 1.11]), and diastolic blood pressure (- 4.74 mmHg [- 9.17 to - 0.31]); small important reductions in LDL-C (- 0.19 mmol/L [- 0.29 to - 0.09]) and c-reactive protein (CRP) (- 0.82 mg/L [- 1.26 to - 0.37]); and trivial increases in HDL-C (0.05 mmol/L [0.00 to 0.09]). No other outcomes showed differences. There was no meaningful effect modification by added sugars across outcomes. The certainty of evidence was high for LDL-C and non-HDL-C; moderate for systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, CRP, and HDL-C; and generally moderate-to-low for all other outcomes. We could not conduct the sub-study of the effect of lactose versus added sugars, as no eligible trials could be identified. Current evidence provides a good indication that replacing cow's milk with soymilk (including sweetened soymilk) does not adversely affect established cardiometabolic risk factors and may result in advantages for blood lipids, blood pressure, and inflammation in adults with a mix of health statuses. The classification of plant-based dairy alternatives such as soymilk as ultra-processed may be misleading as it relates to their cardiometabolic effects and may need to be reconsidered in the transition to plant-based diets.

39157372,Empowering vertical farming through IoT and AI-Driven technologies: A comprehensive review.,"The substantial increase in the human population dramatically strains food supplies. Farmers need healthy soil and natural minerals for traditional farming, and production takes a little longer time. The soil-free farming method known as vertical farming (VF) requires a small land and consumes a very small amount of water than conventional soil-dependent farming techniques. With modern technologies like hydroponics, aeroponics, and aquaponics, the notion of the VF appears to have a promising future in urban areas where farming land is very expensive and scarce. VF faces difficulty in the simultaneous monitoring of multiple indicators, nutrition advice, and plant diagnosis systems. However, these issues can be resolved by implementing current technical advancements like artificial intelligence (AI)-based control techniques such as machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), the internet of things (IoT), image processing as well as computer vision. This article presents a thorough analysis of ML and IoT applications in VF system. The areas on which the attention is concentrated include disease detection, crop yield prediction, nutrition, and irrigation control management. In order to predict crop yield and crop diseases, the computer vision technique is investigated in view of the classification of distinct collections of crop images. This article also illustrates ML and IoT-based VF systems that can raise product quality and production over the long term. Assessment and evaluation of the knowledge-based VF system have also been outlined in the article with the potential outcomes, advantages, and limitations of ML and IoT in the VF system.",Rathor AS; Choudhury S; Sharma A; Nautiyal P; Shah G,Heliyon,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39157372/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39150034,Using augmented intelligence to improve long term outcomes.,"For augmented intelligence (AI) tools to realize their potential, critical care clinicians must ensure they are designed to improve long-term outcomes. This overview is intended to align professionals with the state-of-the art of AI. Many AI tools are undergoing preliminary assessment of their ability to support the care of survivors and their caregivers at multiple time points after intensive care unit (ICU) discharge. The domains being studied include early identification of deterioration (physiological, mental), management of impaired physical functioning, pain, sleep and sexual dysfunction, improving nutrition and communication, and screening and treatment of cognitive impairment and mental health disorders.Several technologies are already being marketed and many more are in various stages of development. These technologies mostly still require clinical trials outcome testing. However, lacking a formal regulatory approval process, some are already in use. Plans for long-term management of ICU survivors must account for the development of a holistic follow-up system that incorporates AI across multiple platforms. A tiered post-ICU screening program may be established wherein AI tools managed by ICU follow-up clinics provide appropriate assistance without human intervention in cases with less pathology and refer severe cases to expert treatment.",Zahavi I; Ben Shitrit I; Einav S,Current opinion in critical care,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39150034/,1,0,0,0,0,1
39148075,Insights into the cardiovascular benefits of taurine: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the foremost cause of mortality globally. Taurine, an amino acid, holds promise for cardiovascular health through mechanisms such as calcium regulation, blood pressure reduction, and antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Despite these potential benefits, previous studies have yielded inconsistent results. This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aims to evaluate the existing evidence on the quantitative effects of taurine on hemodynamic parameters and cardiac function grading, which are indicative of overall cardiovascular health and performance. We conducted an electronic search across multiple databases, including Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov, from their inception to January 2, 2024. Our analysis focused on key cardiovascular outcomes, such as heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification. Meta-regression was applied to explore dose-dependent relationships based on the total taurine dose administered during the treatment period. A subgroup analysis, stratified according to the baseline disease status of patients, was also conducted. The analysis included a pooled sample of 808 participants from 20 randomized controlled trials. Taurine demonstrated a significant reduction in HR (weighted mean difference [WMD] = -3.579 bpm, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -6.044 to -1.114, p = 0.004), SBP (WMD = -3.999 mm Hg, 95% CI = -7.293 to -0.706, p = 0.017), DBP (WMD: -1.435 mm Hg, 95% CI: -2.484 to -0.386, p = 0.007), NYHA (WMD: -0.403, 95% CI: -0.522 to -0.283, p < 0.001), and a significant increase in LVEF (WMD: 4.981%, 95% CI: 1.556 to 8.407, p = 0.004). Meta-regression indicated a dose-dependent reduction in HR (coefficient = -0.0150 per g, p = 0.333), SBP (coefficient = -0.0239 per g, p = 0.113), DBP (coefficient = -0.0089 per g, p = 0.110), and NYHA (coefficient = -0.0016 per g, p = 0.111), and a positive correlation with LVEF (coefficient = 0.0285 per g, p = 0.308). No significant adverse effects were observed compared to controls. In subgroup analysis, taurine significantly improved HR in heart failure patients and healthy individuals. Taurine significantly reduced SBP in healthy individuals, heart failure patients, and those with other diseases, while significantly lowered DBP in hypertensive patients It notably increased LVEF in heart failure patients and improved NYHA functional class in both heart failure patients and those with other diseases. Taurine showed noteworthy effects in preventing hypertension and enhancing cardiac function. Individuals prone to CVDs may find it advantageous to include taurine in their daily regimen.",Tzang CC; Lin WC; Lin LH; Lin TY; Chang KV; Wu WT; Özçakar L,Nutrition journal,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39148075/,0,1,0,1,0,0
39135125,Systematic literature review of the somatic comorbidities experienced by adults with phenylketonuria.,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism that, if untreated, causes Phe accumulation in the brain leading to neurophysiologic alterations and poor outcomes. Lifelong management centers on dietary Phe restriction, yet long-term complete metabolic control is unachievable for many adults. High blood Phe levels or chronic Phe and intact protein restriction in the diet may lead to somatic comorbidities. A systematic literature review was conducted to evaluate somatic comorbidities experienced by adults with PKU. Clinical and observational studies reporting somatic comorbidities experienced by individuals with PKU aged ≥ 16 years (or classified as adults) evaluating a Phe-restricted diet with or without pharmacologic therapy versus no therapeutic intervention (including healthy controls), or pharmacologic therapy versus a Phe-restricted diet alone, were identified. PubMed® was searched (February 1, 2022 and updated November 1, 2023), using a pre-defined search strategy, followed by two-stage screening and data extraction. Included studies were grouped by PKU population comparison. 1185 records were screened; 51 studies across 12,602 individuals were extracted. Bone-related abnormalities were the most reported outcome (n = 21); several outcome measures were used. Original study groupings included: Phe-restricted diet versus healthy controls or reference values (n = 40); treatment-adherent versus those non-adherent (n = 12). Additional groups added as part of a protocol amendment included: different Phe-restricted diets (n = 4); severe versus less severe disease (n = 5). Vote counting indicated a higher burden of ≥ 1 comorbidity (or outcome measure) for the Phe-restricted diet group by 37 of 38 studies included in the analysis of Phe-restricted diet versus healthy controls; higher burden in healthy controls was reported in 12 studies. Vote counting was similar between those treatment adherent (n = 7) versus non-adherent (n = 10). Adults with PKU have a higher comorbidity burden than a non-PKU population. More robust studies are needed to better understand the relationship between effective metabolic control and comorbidity burden, using consistent outcome measures.

39089512,Microbial mysteries: Staphylococcus aureus and the enigma of carcinogenesis.,"Staphylococcus aureus, a common human pathogen, has long been the focus of scientific investigation due to its association with various infections. However, recent research has unveiled a tantalizing enigma surrounding this bacterium and its potential involvement in carcinogenesis. Chronic S. aureus infections have been linked to an elevated risk of certain cancers, including skin cancer and oral cancer. This review explores the current state of knowledge regarding this connection, examining epidemiological evidence, pathogenic mechanisms, and biological interactions that suggest a correlation. Although initial studies point to a possible link, the precise mechanisms through which S. aureus may contribute to cancer development remain elusive. Emerging evidence suggests that the chronic inflammation induced by persistent S. aureus infections may create a tumor-promoting environment. This inflammation can lead to DNA damage, disrupt cellular signaling pathways, and generate an immunosuppressive microenvironment conducive to cancer progression. Additionally, S. aureus produces a variety of toxins and metabolites that can directly interact with host cells, potentially inducing oncogenic transformations. Despite these insights, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the exact biological processes involved. This review emphasizes the urgent need for more comprehensive research to clarify these microbiological mysteries. Understanding the role of S. aureus in cancer development could lead to novel strategies for cancer prevention and treatment, potentially transforming therapeutic approaches.",Odunitan TT; Apanisile BT; Akinboade MW; Abdulazeez WO; Oyaronbi AO; Ajayi TM; Oyekola SA; Ibrahim NO; Nafiu T; Afolabi HO; Olayiwola DM; David OT; Adeyemo SF; Ayodeji OD; Akinade EM; Saibu OA,Microbial pathogenesis,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39089512/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Current programs in Asian countries operate separately for the two sectors and are principally concerned with detection of events that represent a short-term disease threat. It is not realistic to either invest only in efforts to detect emerging diseases, or to rely solely on event-based surveillance. A comprehensive strategy is needed, concurrently investigating and managing endemic zoonoses, studying evolving diseases which change their character and importance due to influences such as demographic and climatic change, and enhancing understanding of factors which are likely to influence the emergence of new pathogens. This requires utilisation of additional investigation tools that have become available in recent years but are not yet being used to full effect. As yet there is no fully formed blueprint that can be applied in Asian countries.

Smartwatches, coupled with powerful artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled algorithms, offer a promising tool for early detection due to their widespread use, easiness of use, and potential cost-effectiveness. Commercially available smartwatches have gained clearance from the FDA to detect AF and are becoming increasingly popular. Despite their promise, the evolving landscape of AI-enabled smartwatch-based AF detection raises questions about the clinical value of this technology. Following the ongoing digital transformation of healthcare, clinicians should familiarize themselves with how AI-enabled smartwatches function in AF detection and navigate their role in clinical settings to deliver optimal patient care. In this review, we provide a concise overview of the characteristics of AI-enabled smartwatch algorithms, their diagnostic performance, clinical value, limitations, and discuss future perspectives in AF diagnosis.",Papalamprakopoulou Z; Stavropoulos D; Moustakidis S; Avgerinos D; Efremidis M; Kampaktsis PN,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39077110/,1,0,0,0,0,0

39077040,Triple-crises-induced food insecurity: systematic understanding and resilience building approaches in Africa.,"The triple crises of the COVID-19 pandemic, conflict and climate change have severely impacted food systems, leading to socio-economic consequences and undermining food and nutrition security across Africa. To address the malnutrition and poverty affecting approximately 700 million people in Africa, there is potential for the One Health approach implementation and operationalization to bring together multidisciplinary solutions for tackling food insecurity and ensuring food safety net. However, there is limited documentation on the potential of the One Health approach system thinking implementation to guide responses to triple crises-induced food insecurity. Therefore, this article aims to systematically understand the triple crises-induced food insecurity, connect existing solutions, and explore the role of the One Health approach in strengthening food and agriculture systems in Africa. Our finding showed the impact of triple crises exacerbating food system vulnerability in Africa and worldwide. Mitigating and resilient actions are urgently needed in tackling the emerging and persisting challenges, and infectious diseases menace and burden across Africa. We present a conceptual model illustrating the complex nature of triple crises-induced food insecurity, vulnerability areas within the food system, and actionable strategies for building community food resilience. Additionally, recommendations are provided to create an enabling environment that supports One Health approach implementation and addresses food insecurity challenges through innovative partnerships, local-led initiatives, and enhanced governance and artificial intelligence technology capacities in achieving sustainable and inclusive growth to reduce socio-economic inequalities. Stepping up integrated, actionable, and sustainable food systems programs and innovative long-lasting solutions requires investing in promoting new partnership and research collaboration in building conflict resolution and peace towards strengthening and reshaping local and global food security related climate change adaptations actions for most vulnerable communities' benefits. These are ingredients in fastening preparedness, prevention and control of infectious diseases prevention and control, reducing food supply chains disruption towards accelerating equitable benefits of Universal Health Coverage and Sustainable Development Goals, 2030 across Africa.",Tambo E; Zhang CS; Tazemda GB; Fankep B; Tappa NT; Bkamko CFB; Tsague LM; Tchemembe D; Ngazoue EF; Korie KK; Djobet MPN; Olalubi OA; Njajou ON,Science in One Health,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39077040/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39073166,Role of artificial intelligence in critical care nutrition support and research.,"Nutrition plays a key role in the comprehensive care of critically ill patients. Determining optimal nutrition strategy, however, remains a subject of intense debate. Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are becoming increasingly common in medicine, and specifically in critical care, driven by the data-rich environment of intensive care units. In this review, we will examine the evidence regarding the application of AI in critical care nutrition. As of now, the use of AI in critical care nutrition is relatively limited, with its primary emphasis on malnutrition screening and tolerance of enteral nutrition. Despite the current scarcity of evidence, the potential for AI for more personalized nutrition management for critically ill patients is substantial. This stems from the ability of AI to integrate multiple data streams reflecting patients' changing needs while addressing inherent heterogeneity. The application of AI in critical care nutrition holds promise for optimizing patient outcomes through tailored and adaptive nutrition interventions. A successful implementation of AI, however, necessitates a multidisciplinary approach, coupled with careful consideration of challenges related to data management, financial aspects, and patient privacy.",Kittrell HD; Shaikh A; Adintori PA; McCarthy P; Kohli-Seth R; Nadkarni GN; Sakhuja A,Nutrition in clinical practice : official publication of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39073166/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39063300,Step-by-Step Metagenomics for Food Microbiome Analysis: A Detailed Review.,"This review article offers a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of using metagenomic tools in food microbiome research. It covers the scientific foundation and practical application of genetic analysis techniques for microbial material from food, including bioinformatic analysis and data interpretation. The method discussed in the article for analyzing microorganisms in food without traditional culture methods is known as food metagenomics. This approach, along with other omics technologies such as nutrigenomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics, collectively forms the field of foodomics. Food metagenomics allows swift and thorough examination of bacteria and potential metabolic pathways by utilizing foodomic databases. Despite its established scientific basis and available bioinformatics resources, the research approach of food metagenomics outlined in the article is not yet widely implemented in industry. The authors believe that the integration of next-generation sequencing (NGS) with rapidly advancing digital technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and big data will facilitate the widespread adoption of this research strategy in microbial analysis for the food industry. This adoption is expected to enhance food safety and product quality in the near future.",Sadurski J; Polak-Berecka M; Staniszewski A; Waśko A,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39063300/,1,0,0,0,0,0

39060902,Endoscopic approaches to the management of dysplasia in inflammatory bowel disease: A state-of-the-art narrative review.,"Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at an increased risk of developing colitis-associated neoplasia (CAN), including colorectal cancer (CRC), through the inflammation-dysplasia-neoplasia pathway. Dysplasia is the most reliable, early and actionable marker for CAN in these patients. While such lesions are frequently encountered, adequate management depends on an accurate assessment, complete resection and close surveillance. With recent advances in endoscopic technologies and research in the field of CAN, the management of dysplastic lesions has significantly improved. The American Gastroenterology Association and Surveillance for Colorectal Endoscopic Neoplasia Detection (SCENIC) provide a guideline framework for approaching dysplastic lesions in patients with IBD. However, there are significant gaps in these recommendations and real-world clinical practice. Accurate lesion assessment remains pivotal for adequate management of CAN. Artificial intelligence-guided modalities are now increasingly being used to aid the detection of these lesions further. As the lesion detection technologies are improving, our armamentarium of resection techniques is also expanding and includes hot or cold polypectomy, endoscopic mucosal resection, endoscopic sub-mucosal dissection and full-thickness resection. With the broadened scope of endoscopic resection, the recommendations regarding surveillance after resection has also changed. Certain patient populations such as those with invisible dysplasia or with prior colectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis need special consideration. In the present review, we aim to provide a state-of-the-art summary of the current practice of endoscopic detection, resection and surveillance of dysplasia in patients with IBD and provide some perspective on the future directions based on the latest research.",Singh AD; Desai A; Dziegielewski C; Kochhar GS,Indian journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Indian Society of Gastroenterology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39060902/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39047690,Precision Nutrition for Management of Cardiovascular Disease Risk during Menopause.,"Women can spend up to 40% of their lives in the postmenopausal state. As women begin to transition into menopause, known as perimenopause, changes in hormonal concentrations and body composition dramatically increase overall cardiometabolic risk. Dietary patterns and interventions can be utilized to prevent and treat cardiovascular disease (CVD) and some dietary patterns over others may be more beneficial due to their specific effects on the health aspects of menopause. In this narrative review, we summarize key cardiovascular alterations that occur during the menopause transition and explore current dietary recommendations to address CVD risk as well as explore the new frontier of precision nutrition and the implications for nutrition prescription during menopause. Popular dietary interventions for CVD such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and the Mediterranean diet (MED) have limited data in women following menopause. However, both diets improve CVD risk biomarkers of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as well as lower oxidative stress and inflammation and improve endothelial function. As the menopause transition increases the risk for developing metabolic syndrome, insulin insensitivity, and dyslipidemia, the DASH diet and MED may be impactful dietary strategies for mediating CVD risk in menopausal women. However, these are ""one-size-fits-all"" approaches that neglect individual characteristics such as genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Precision nutrition considers individual factors for nutrition prescription, spanning from evaluating food intake preferences and behaviors to deep phenotyping. Data from a large-scale investigation of the menopause transition suggests nutritional strategies that address postprandial glycemic responses, and the gut microbiome may attenuate some of the unfavorable effects of menopause on CVD risk factors. Considering menopause, women are a clinical population that would greatly benefit from precision nutrition. Future research should explore the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence in a precision nutrition framework to modify the DASH diet and MED to address adverse effects that occur during the menopause transition are vital for supporting women's health as they age.",Cabre HE; Woolf EK; Redman LM,Lifestyle genomics,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39047690/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Yet, most genome-wide association studies (GWAS) focus on AD. We conducted a GWAS of all-cause dementia (ACD) and examined the genetic overlap with VaD. Our dataset includes 800,597 individuals, with 46,902 and 8702 cases of ACD and VaD, respectively. Known AD loci for ACD and VaD were replicated. Bioinformatic analyses prioritized genes that are likely functionally relevant and shared with closely related traits and risk factors. For ACD, novel loci identified were associated with energy transport (SEMA4D), neuronal excitability (ANO3), amyloid deposition in the brain (RBFOX1), and magnetic resonance imaging markers of small vessel disease (SVD; HBEGF). Novel VaD loci were associated with hypertension, diabetes, and neuron maintenance (SPRY2, FOXA2, AJAP1, and PSMA3). Our study identified genetic risks underlying ACD, demonstrating overlap with neurodegenerative processes, vascular risk factors, and cerebral SVD. We conducted the largest genome-wide association study of all-cause dementia (ACD) and vascular dementia (VaD). Known genetic variants associated with AD were replicated for ACD and VaD. Functional analyses identified novel loci for ACD and VaD.

39026496,[Relationship between GTSE1 and Cell Cycle and Potential Regulatory Mechanisms  in Lung Cancer Cells].,"The regulation of the cell cycle is essential for maintaining normal cellular function, especially in the development of diseases such as lung cancer. The cell cycle consists of four major phases (G1, S, G2 and M phases), which are characterized by a series of precise molecular events to ensure proper cell proliferation and division. In lung cancer cells, cell cycle dysregulation can lead to disordered proliferation and increased invasiveness of cancer cells. G2 and S-phase expressed 1 (GTSE1) is a regulatory protein found in the cytoplasm of the cell, which plays a key role in the cell cycle distribution of a wide range of cancer cells and is involved in life processes such as cell proliferation and apoptosis. GTSE1 affects cell cycle progression by interacting with cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21) and maintaining the stability of p21, which in turn inhibits the activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 1/2 (CDK1/2). In addition, GTSE1 is also involved in the regulation of tumor protein 53 (p53) signaling pathway. With the assistance of mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), GTSE1 is able to transport p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and promote its ubiquitination and degradation, thus affecting cell cycle and cell death-related signaling pathways. This paper reviews the expression of GTSE1 in lung cancer cells and its effects on lung cancer, as well as its potential mechanisms involved in cell cycle regulation. .",Wang C; Xu J; Liu M; Liu J; Huang Y; Zhou L,Zhongguo fei ai za zhi = Chinese journal of lung cancer,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39026496/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39026059,Imaging Techniques and Biochemical Biomarkers: New Insights into Diagnosis of Pancreatic Cancer.,"Pancreatic cancer (PaC) incidence is increasing, but our current screening and diagnostic strategies are not very effective. However, screening could be helpful in the case of PaC, as recent evidence shows that the disease progresses gradually. Unfortunately, there is no ideal screening method or program for detecting PaC in its early stages. Conventional imaging techniques, such as abdominal ultrasound, CT, MRI, and EUS, have not been successful in detecting early-stage PaC. On the other hand, biomarkers may be a more effective screening tool for PaC and have greater potential for further evaluation compared to imaging. Recent studies on biomarkers and artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced imaging have shown promising results in the early diagnosis of PaC. In addition to proteins, non-coding RNAs are also being studied as potential biomarkers for PaC. This review consolidates the current literature on PaC screening modalities to provide an organized framework for future studies. While conventional imaging techniques have not been effective in detecting early-stage PaC, biomarkers and AI-enhanced imaging are promising avenues of research. Further studies on the use of biomarkers, particularly non-coding RNAs, in combination with imaging modalities may improve the accuracy of PaC screening and lead to earlier detection of this deadly disease.",Jafari SH; Lajevardi ZS; Zamani Fard MM; Jafari A; Naghavi S; Ravaei F; Taghavi SP; Mosadeghi K; Zarepour F; Mahjoubin-Tehran M; Rahimian N; Mirzaei H,Cell biochemistry and biophysics,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39026059/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39004833,Groove pancreatitis: From enigma to future directions-A comprehensive review.,"Groove pancreatitis (GP) is a rare and clinically distinct form of chronic pancreatitis affecting the pancreaticoduodenal groove comprising the head of the pancreas, duodenum, and the common bile duct. It is more prevalent in individuals in their 4-5th decade of life and disproportionately affects men compared with women. Excessive alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking, pancreatic ductal stones, pancreatic divisum, annular pancreas, ectopic pancreas, duodenal wall thickening, and peptic ulcers are significant risk factors implicated in the development of GP. The usual presenting symptoms include severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and jaundice. Establishing a diagnosis of GP is often challenging due to significant clinical and radiological overlap with numerous benign and malignant conditions affecting the same anatomical location. This can lead to a delay in initiation of treatment leading to increasing morbidity, mortality, and complication rates. Promising research in artificial intelligence (AI) has garnered immense interest in recent years. Due to its widespread application in diagnostic imaging with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity, AI has the potential of becoming a vital tool in differentiating GP from pancreatic malignancies, thereby preventing a missed or delayed diagnosis. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of GP, covering the etiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, radiological and endoscopic evaluation, management strategies, and future directions. This article also aims to increase awareness about this lesser known and often-misdiagnosed clinical entity amongst clinicians to ultimately improve patient outcomes.",Dahiya DS; Shah YR; Canakis A; Parikh C; Chandan S; Ali H; Gangwani MK; Pinnam BSM; Singh S; Sohail AH; Patel R; Ramai D; Al-Haddad M; Baron T; Rastogi A,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39004833/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39001427,Defining and Addressing Research Priorities in Cancer Cachexia through Transdisciplinary Collaboration.,"For many patients, the cancer continuum includes a syndrome known as cancer-associated cachexia (CAC), which encompasses the unintended loss of body weight and muscle mass, and is often associated with fat loss, decreased appetite, lower tolerance and poorer response to treatment, poor quality of life, and reduced survival. Unfortunately, there are no effective therapeutic interventions to completely reverse cancer cachexia and no FDA-approved pharmacologic agents; hence, new approaches are urgently needed. In May of 2022, researchers and clinicians from Moffitt Cancer Center held an inaugural retreat on CAC that aimed to review the state of the science, identify knowledge gaps and research priorities, and foster transdisciplinary collaborative research projects. This review summarizes research priorities that emerged from the retreat, examples of ongoing collaborations, and opportunities to move science forward. The highest priorities identified include the need to (1) evaluate patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures obtained in clinical practice and assess their use in improving CAC-related outcomes; (2) identify biomarkers (imaging, molecular, and/or behavioral) and novel analytic approaches to accurately predict the early onset of CAC and its progression; and (3) develop and test interventions (pharmacologic, nutritional, exercise-based, and through mathematical modeling) to prevent CAC progression and improve associated symptoms and outcomes.",Park MA; Whelan CJ; Ahmed S; Boeringer T; Brown J; Crowder SL; Gage K; Gregg C; Jeong DK; Jim HSL; Judge AR; Mason TM; Parker N; Pillai S; Qayyum A; Rajasekhara S; Rasool G; Tinsley SM; Schabath MB; Stewart P; West J; McDonald P; Permuth JB,Cancers,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39001427/,1,0,0,0,0,0

AI is constantly changing and is revolutionizing the healthcare field, including nutrition. This review's purpose is four-fold: (i) to investigate AI's role in nutrition research; (ii) to identify areas in nutrition using AI; (iii) to understand AI's future potential impact; (iv) to investigate possible concerns about AI's use in nutrition research. Eight databases were searched: PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, Agricola, Scopus, IEEE Explore, Google Scholar and Cochrane. A total of 1737 articles were retrieved, of which 22 were included in the review. Article screening phases included duplicates elimination, title-abstract selection, full-text review, and quality assessment. The key findings indicated AI's role in nutrition is at a developmental stage, focusing mainly on dietary assessment and less on malnutrition prediction, lifestyle interventions, and diet-related diseases comprehension. Clinical research is needed to determine AI's intervention efficacy. The ethics of AI use, a main concern, remains unresolved and needs to be considered for collateral damage prevention to certain populations. The studies' heterogeneity in this review limited the focus on specific nutritional areas.

38971530,"The Evolution of Science and Regulation of Dietary Supplements: Past, Present, and Future.","Dietary supplement use in the United States is widespread and increasing, especially among certain population groups, such as older Americans. The science surrounding dietary supplements has evolved substantially over the last few decades since their formal regulation in 1994. Much has been learned about the mechanisms of action of many dietary supplement ingredients, but the evidence on their health effects is still building. As is true of much nutrition research, there are many studies that point to health effects, but not all are at the level of scientific evidence (e.g., randomized controlled interventions), rigor, or quality needed for definitive statements of efficacy regarding clinical end points. New technologies and approaches are being applied to the science of dietary supplements, including nutrigenomics and microbiome analysis, data science, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning-all of which can elevate the science behind dietary supplements. Products can contain an array of bioactive compounds derived from foods as well as from medicinal plants, which creates enormous challenges in data collection and management. Clinical applications, particularly those aimed at providing personalized nutrition options for patients, have become more sophisticated as dietary supplements are incorporated increasingly into clinical practice and self-care.

Most of these tools are based on predefined questionnaires and consensus guidelines. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) allows for automated tools to detect malnutrition in an earlier stage to prevent long-term consequences. In this study, a systematic literature review was carried out with the goal of providing detailed information on what patient groups, screening tools, machine learning algorithms, data types, and variables are being used, as well as the current limitations and implementation stage of these AI-based tools. The results showed that a staggering majority exceeding 90% of all AI models go unused in day-to-day clinical practice. Furthermore, supervised learning models seemed to be the most popular type of learning.

Intensive agricultural practices have adversely impacted soil quality, necessitating soil nutrient analysis for enhancing farm productivity and environmental sustainability. Researchers increasingly turn to Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to improve crop yield estimation and optimize soil nutrition management. This study reviews 155 papers published from 2014 to 2024, assessing the use of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) in predicting soil nutrients. It highlights the potential of hyperspectral and multispectral sensors, which enable precise nutrient identification through spectral analysis across multiple bands. The study underscores the importance of feature selection techniques to improve model performance by eliminating redundant spectral bands with weak correlations to targeted nutrients. Additionally, the use of spectral indices, derived from mathematical ratios of spectral bands based on absorption spectra, is examined for its effectiveness in accurately predicting soil nutrient levels. By evaluating various performance measures and datasets related to soil nutrient prediction, this paper offers comprehensive insights into the applicability of AI techniques in optimizing soil nutrition management.

38943150,Dietary choline intake in European and non-european populations: current status and future trends-a narrative review.,"Choline is a nutrient necessary for the proper functioning of the body with a multidimensional impact on human health. However, comprehensive studies evaluating the dietary intake of choline are limited. The aim of this narrative review is to analyze current trends in choline intake in European and non-European populations. The secondary aim was to discuss possible future choline trends. The search strategy involved a systematic approach to identifying relevant literature that met specific inclusion criteria. Observational studies and randomized clinical trials were searched for in PubMed and Scopus databases from January 2016 to April 2024. This review includes the characteristics of study groups, sample sizes, methods used to assess choline intake and time period, databases used to determine intake, choline intakes, and the main sources of choline in the diet. The review considered all population groups for which information on choline intake was collected. In most studies performed in Europe after 2015 choline intake did not exceed 80% of the AI standard value. The mean choline intake for adults in different European countries were 310 mg/day, while the highest value was reported for Polish men at 519 mg/day. In non-European countries, mean choline intakes were 293 mg/day and above. The main reported sources of choline in the diet are products of animal origin, mainly eggs and meat. The available data describing the potential intake of these products in the EU in the future predict an increase in egg intake by another 8% compared to 2008-2019 and a decrease in meat intake by about 2 kg per capita from 2018 to 2030. In the last decade, choline intake among adults has been insufficient, both in Europe and outside it.

38941492,How Diet and Lifestyle Can Fine-Tune Gut Microbiomes for Healthy Aging.,"Many physical, social, and psychological changes occur during aging that raise the risk of developing chronic diseases, frailty, and dependency. These changes adversely affect the gut microbiota, a phenomenon known as microbe-aging. Those microbiota alterations are, in turn, associated with the development of age-related diseases. The gut microbiota is highly responsive to lifestyle and dietary changes, displaying a flexibility that also provides anactionable tool by which healthy aging can be promoted. This review covers, firstly, the main lifestyle and socioeconomic factors that modify the gut microbiota composition and function during healthy or unhealthy aging and, secondly, the advances being made in defining and promoting healthy aging, including microbiome-informed artificial intelligence tools, personalized dietary patterns, and food probiotic systems.",Tamayo M; Olivares M; Ruas-Madiedo P; Margolles A; Espín JC; Medina I; Moreno-Arribas MV; Canals S; Mirasso CR; Ortín S; Beltrán-Sanchez H; Palloni A; Tomás-Barberán FA; Sanz Y,Annual review of food science and technology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38941492/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38935016,Development of American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy standards for training in advanced endoscopy within dedicated advanced endoscopy fellowship programs.,"Training in interventional endoscopy is offered by nonaccredited advanced endoscopy fellowship programs (AEFPs). The number of these programs has increased dramatically with a concurrent increase in the breadth and complexity of interventional endoscopy procedures. Accreditation is governed by competency-based education, yet what constitutes a ""high-quality"" nonaccredited AEFP has not been defined. Using an evidence-based consensus process, we aimed to establish standards for AEFPs. The RAND UCLA appropriateness method, a well-described modified Delphi process to develop quality indicators, was used. A task force established by the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy drafted potential quality indicators (structure, process, and outcome) in 6 categories: activity preceding training; structure of AEFPs; training in ERCP, EUS, and EMR; and luminal stent placement. Three rounds of iterative feedback from 20 experts were conducted. Round 0 involved discussion of project details. In round 1, experts independently ranked proposed quality indicators on a 9-point interval scale ranging from highly inappropriate (1) to highly appropriate (9). Next, proposed quality indicators were discussed and reworded in a group meeting followed by round 2, in which experts independently reranked proposed quality indicators and provided benchmarks (when applicable). The median score for each quality indicator was calculated. Mean absolute deviation from the median was calculated, and appropriateness of potential quality indicators was assessed using the BIOMED concerted action on appropriateness definition, P value method, and interpercentile range adjusted for symmetry definition. A quality indicator was deemed appropriate if the median score was ≥7 and met criteria for appropriateness using all 3 defined statistical methods. Of 89 proposed quality indicators, 37 statements met criteria as appropriate for a quality indicator (activity preceding training, 2; structure of AEFPs, 10; training in ERCP, 7; training in EUS, 8; training in EMR, 7; luminal stent placement, 3). Minimum thresholds were defined for 19 relevant quality indicators for number of trainers, procedures during fellowship, and procedures before assessment of competence. Among the final appropriate quality indicators were that all trainees should undergo qualitative and quantitative competence assessments using validated tools at least quarterly with documented feedback throughout the training period and that trainees should track outcomes and relevant quality metrics for specific procedures. This consensus process using validated methodology established standards for an AEFP in an effort to ensure adequate training in the most commonly taught interventional endoscopic procedures (ERCP, EUS, EMR, and luminal stent placement) during fellowship. An important component of an AEFP is the use of competency-based assessments that are compliant with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education's Next Accreditation System, with the goal of ensuring that trainees achieve specific milestones in their progression to achieving cognitive and technical competency.",Wani S; Cote GA; Keswani RN; Yadlapati RH; Hall M; O'Hara J; Berzin TM; Burbridge RA; Chahal P; Cohen J; Coyle WJ; Early D; Guda NM; Inamdar S; Khanna L; Kulkarni A; Rosenkranz L; Sharma N; Shin EJ; Siddiqui UD; Sinha J; Vanderveldt H; Draganov PV,Gastrointestinal endoscopy,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38935016/,0,0,0,0,0,0

38901183,Diverse mechanisms by which chemical pollutant exposure alters gut microbiota metabolism and inflammation.,"The human gut microbiome, the host, and the environment are inextricably linked across the life course with significant health impacts. Consisting of trillions of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and other micro-organisms, microbiota living within our gut are particularly dynamic and responsible for digestion and metabolism of diverse classes of ingested chemical pollutants. Exposure to chemical pollutants not only in early life but throughout growth and into adulthood can alter human hosts' ability to absorb and metabolize xenobiotics, nutrients, and other components critical to health and longevity. Inflammation is a common mechanism underlying multiple environmentally related chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, multiple cancer types, and mental health. While growing research supports complex interactions between pollutants and the gut microbiome, significant gaps exist. Few reviews provide descriptions of the complex mechanisms by which chemical pollutants interact with the host microbiome through either direct or indirect pathways to alter disease risk, with a particular focus on inflammatory pathways. This review focuses on examples of several classes of pollutants commonly ingested by humans, including (i) heavy metals, (ii) persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and (iii) nitrates. Digestive enzymes and gut microbes are the first line of absorption and metabolism of these chemicals, and gut microbes have been shown to alter compounds from a less to more toxic state influencing subsequent distribution and excretion. In addition, chemical pollutants may interact with or alter the selection of more harmful and less commensal microbiota, leading to gut dysbiosis, and changes in receptor-mediated signaling pathways that alter the integrity and function of the gut intestinal tract. Arsenic, cadmium, and lead (heavy metals), influence the microbiome directly by altering different classes of bacteria, and subsequently driving inflammation through metabolite production and different signaling pathways (LPS/TLR4 or proteoglycan/TLR2 pathways). POPs can alter gut microbial composition either directly or indirectly depending on their ability to activate key signaling pathways within the intestine (e.g., PCB-126 and AHR). Nitrates and nitrites' effect on the gut and host may depend on their ability to be transformed to secondary and tertiary metabolites by gut bacteria. Future research should continue to support foundational research both in vitro, in vivo, and longitudinal population-based research to better identify opportunities for prevention, gain additional mechanistic insights into the complex interactions between environmental pollutants and the microbiome and support additional translational science.",Teffera M; Veith AC; Ronnekleiv-Kelly S; Bradfield CA; Nikodemova M; Tussing-Humphreys L; Malecki K,Environment international,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38901183/,1,0,0,0,0,1

Despite the rapid development of such software, disparities still exist in terms of methodology, contents, and implementation strategies. Hence, a set of panoramic profiles is urgently needed to elucidate their values and guide their future development. Here a comprehensive review was conducted aiming to summarize and compare the objects, contents, intelligent algorithms, and functions realized by the already released software in current research. Consequently, 177 AI nutritionists in recent years were collected and analyzed. The advantages, limitations, and trends concerning their application scenarios were analyzed. It was found that AI nutritionists have been gradually advancing the production modes and efficiency of food recognition, dietary recording/monitoring, nutritional assessment, and nutrient/recipe recommendation. Most AI nutritionists have a relatively low level of intelligence. However, new trends combining advanced AI algorithms, intelligent sensors and big data are coming with new applications in real-time and precision nutrition.

38847753,Glutamine-derived peptides: Current progress and future directions.,"Glutamine, the most abundant amino acid in the body, plays a critical role in preserving immune function, nitrogen balance, intestinal integrity, and resistance to infection. However, its limited solubility and instability present challenges for its use a functional nutrient. Consequently, there is a preference for utilizing glutamine-derived peptides as an alternative to achieve enhanced functionality. This article aims to review the applications of glutamine monomers in clinical, sports, and enteral nutrition. It compares the functional effectiveness of monomers and glutamine-derived peptides and provides a comprehensive assessment of glutamine-derived peptides in terms of their classification, preparation, mechanism of absorption, and biological activity. Furthermore, this study explores the potential integration of artificial intelligence (AI)-based peptidomics and synthetic biology in the de novo design and large-scale production of these peptides. The findings reveal that glutamine-derived peptides possess significant structure-related bioactivities, with the smaller molecular weight fraction serving as the primary active ingredient. These peptides possess the ability to promote intestinal homeostasis, exert hypotensive and hypoglycemic effects, and display antioxidant properties. However, our understanding of the structure-function relationships of glutamine-derived peptides remains largely exploratory at current stage. The combination of AI based peptidomics and synthetic biology presents an opportunity to explore the untapped resources of glutamine-derived peptides as functional food ingredients. Additionally, the utilization and bioavailability of these peptides can be enhanced through the use of delivery systems in vivo. This review serves as a valuable reference for future investigations of and developments in the discovery, functional validation, and biomanufacturing of glutamine-derived peptides in food science.",Yu T; Hu T; Na K; Zhang L; Lu S; Guo X,Comprehensive reviews in food science and food safety,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38847753/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38844066,Utility of life stage-specific chemical risk assessments based on New Approach Methodologies (NAMs).,"The safety assessments for chemicals targeted for use or expected to be exposed to specific life stages, including infancy, childhood, pregnancy and lactation, and geriatrics, need to account for extrapolation of data from healthy adults to these populations to assess their human health risk. However, often adequate and relevant toxicity or pharmacokinetic (PK) data of chemicals in specific life stages are not available. For such chemicals, New Approach Methodologies (NAMs), such as physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, biologically based dose response (BBDR) modeling, in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE), etc. can be used to understand the variability of exposure and effects of chemicals in specific life stages and assess their associated risk. A life stage specific PBPK model incorporates the physiological and biochemical changes associated with each life stage and simulates their impact on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) of these chemicals. In our review, we summarize the parameterization of life stage models based on New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) and discuss case studies that highlight the utility of a life stage based PBPK modeling for risk assessment. In addition, we discuss the utility of artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) and other computational models, such as those based on in vitro data, as tools for estimation of relevant physiological or physicochemical parameters and selection of model. We also discuss existing gaps in the available toxicological datasets and current challenges that need to be overcome to expand the utility of NAMs for life stage-specific chemical risk assessment.",Gonnabathula P; Choi MK; Li M; Kabadi SV; Fairman K,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38844066/,1,0,0,0,0,0

38823867,Addressing flavor challenges in reduced-fat dairy products: A review from the perspective of flavor compounds and their improvement strategies.,"In recent years, the demand for reduced-fat dairy products (RFDPs) has increased rapidly as the health risks associated with high-fat diets have become increasingly apparent. Unfortunately, lowering the fat content in dairy products would reduce the flavor perception of fat. Fat-derived flavor compounds are the main contributor to appealing flavor among dairy products. However, the contribution of fat-derived flavor compounds remains underappreciated among the flavor improvement factors of RFDPs. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the flavor perception mechanism of fat and the profile of fat-derived flavor compounds in dairy products. Furthermore, the characteristics and influencing factors of flavor compound release are discussed. Based on the role of these flavor compounds, this review analyzed the current and potential flavor improvement strategies for RFDPs, including physical processing, lipolysis, microbial applications, and fat replacement. Overall, promoting the synthesis of milk fat characteristic flavor compounds in RFDPs and aligning the release properties of flavor compounds from the RFDPs with those of equivalent full-fat dairy products are two core strategies to improve the flavor of reduced-fat dairy products. In the future, better modulation of the behavior of flavor compounds by various methods is promising to replicate the flavor properties of fat in RFDPs and meet consumer sensory demands.",Wang W; Sun B; Deng J; Ai N,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38823867/,1,0,0,0,0,0

38805509,Barriers to engagement in the care cascade for tuberculosis disease in India: A systematic review of quantitative studies.,"India accounts for about one-quarter of people contracting tuberculosis (TB) disease annually and nearly one-third of TB deaths globally. Many Indians do not navigate all care cascade stages to receive TB treatment and achieve recurrence-free survival. Guided by a population/exposure/comparison/outcomes (PECO) framework, we report findings of a systematic review to identify factors contributing to unfavorable outcomes across each care cascade gap for TB disease in India. We defined care cascade gaps as comprising people with confirmed or presumptive TB who did not: start the TB diagnostic workup (Gap 1), complete the workup (Gap 2), start treatment (Gap 3), achieve treatment success (Gap 4), or achieve TB recurrence-free survival (Gap 5). Three systematic searches of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from January 1, 2000 to August 14, 2023 were conducted. We identified articles evaluating factors associated with unfavorable outcomes for each gap (reported as adjusted odds, relative risk, or hazard ratios) and, among people experiencing unfavorable outcomes, reasons for these outcomes (reported as proportions), with specific quality or risk of bias criteria for each gap. Findings were organized into person-, family-, and society-, or health system-related factors, using a social-ecological framework. Factors associated with unfavorable outcomes across multiple cascade stages included: male sex, older age, poverty-related factors, lower symptom severity or duration, undernutrition, alcohol use, smoking, and distrust of (or dissatisfaction with) health services. People previously treated for TB were more likely to seek care and engage in the diagnostic workup (Gaps 1 and 2) but more likely to suffer pretreatment loss to follow-up (Gap 3) and unfavorable treatment outcomes (Gap 4), especially those who were lost to follow-up during their prior treatment. For individual care cascade gaps, multiple studies highlighted lack of TB knowledge and structural barriers (e.g., transportation challenges) as contributing to lack of care-seeking for TB symptoms (Gap 1, 14 studies); lack of access to diagnostics (e.g., X-ray), non-identification of eligible people for testing, and failure of providers to communicate concern for TB as contributing to non-completion of the diagnostic workup (Gap 2, 17 studies); stigma, poor recording of patient contact information by providers, and early death from diagnostic delays as contributing to pretreatment loss to follow-up (Gap 3, 15 studies); and lack of TB knowledge, stigma, depression, and medication adverse effects as contributing to unfavorable treatment outcomes (Gap 4, 86 studies). Medication nonadherence contributed to unfavorable treatment outcomes (Gap 4) and TB recurrence (Gap 5, 14 studies). Limitations include lack of meta-analyses due to the heterogeneity of findings and limited generalizability to some Indian regions, given the country's diverse population. This systematic review illuminates common patterns of risk that shape outcomes for Indians with TB, while highlighting knowledge gaps-particularly regarding TB care for children or in the private sector-to guide future research.

Adipose tissue (AT) plays a crucial role in regulating energy homeostasis and metabolism, and brown AT (BAT) and the browning of white AT (WAT) are promising targets for combating weight gain. Nutritional factors during prenatal and early postnatal stages can influence the development of AT, affecting the likelihood of obesity later on. This narrative review focuses on the nutritional programming of AT features. Research conducted across various animal models with diverse interventions has provided insights into the effects of specific compounds on AT development and function, influencing the development of crucial structures and neuroendocrine circuits responsible for energy balance. The hormone leptin has been identified as an essential nutrient during lactation for healthy metabolic programming against obesity development in adults.

38747976,Brugada syndrome in Japan and Europe: a genome-wide association study reveals shared genetic architecture and new risk loci.,"Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an inherited arrhythmia with a higher disease prevalence and more lethal arrhythmic events in Asians than in Europeans. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed its polygenic architecture mainly in European populations. The aim of this study was to identify novel BrS-associated loci and to compare allelic effects across ancestries. A GWAS was conducted in Japanese participants, involving 940 cases and 1634 controls, followed by a cross-ancestry meta-analysis of Japanese and European GWAS (total of 3760 cases and 11 635 controls). The novel loci were characterized by fine-mapping, gene expression, and splicing quantitative trait associations in the human heart. The Japanese-specific GWAS identified one novel locus near ZSCAN20 (P = 1.0 × 10-8), and the cross-ancestry meta-analysis identified 17 association signals, including six novel loci. The effect directions of the 17 lead variants were consistent (94.1%; P for sign test = 2.7 × 10-4), and their allelic effects were highly correlated across ancestries (Pearson's R = .91; P = 2.9 × 10-7). The genetic risk score derived from the BrS GWAS of European ancestry was significantly associated with the risk of BrS in the Japanese population [odds ratio 2.12 (95% confidence interval 1.94-2.31); P = 1.2 × 10-61], suggesting a shared genetic architecture across ancestries. Functional characterization revealed that a lead variant in CAMK2D promotes alternative splicing, resulting in an isoform switch of calmodulin kinase II-δ, favouring a pro-inflammatory/pro-death pathway. This study demonstrates novel susceptibility loci implicating potentially novel pathogenesis underlying BrS. Despite differences in clinical expressivity and epidemiology, the polygenic architecture of BrS was substantially shared across ancestries.",Ishikawa T; Masuda T; Hachiya T; Dina C; Simonet F; Nagata Y; Tanck MWT; Sonehara K; Glinge C; Tadros R; Khongphatthanayothin A; Lu TP; Higuchi C; Nakajima T; Hayashi K; Aizawa Y; Nakano Y; Nogami A; Morita H; Ohno S; Aiba T; Krijger Juárez C; Mauleekoonphairoj J; Poovorawan Y; Gourraud JB; Shimizu W; Probst V; Horie M; Wilde AAM; Redon R; Juang JJ; Nademanee K; Bezzina CR; Barc J; Tanaka T; Okada Y; Schott JJ; Makita N,European heart journal,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38747976/,0,0,0,1,0,0

38731128,Basic Principles and Role of Endoscopic Ultrasound in Diagnosis and Differentiation of Pancreatic Cancer from Other Pancreatic Lesions: A Comprehensive Review of Endoscopic Ultrasound for Pancreatic Cancer.,"Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Pancreatic lesions consist of both neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions and often pose a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge due to similar clinical and radiological features. In recent years, pancreatic lesions have been discovered more frequently as incidental findings due to the increased utilization and widespread availability of abdominal cross-sectional imaging. Therefore, it becomes imperative to establish an early and appropriate diagnosis with meticulous differentiation in an attempt to balance unnecessary treatment of benign pancreatic lesions and missing the opportunity for early intervention in malignant lesions. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has become an important diagnostic modality for the identification and risk stratification of pancreatic lesions due to its ability to provide detailed imaging and acquisition of tissue samples for analysis with the help of fine-needle aspiration/biopsy. The recent development of EUS-based technology, including contrast-enhanced endoscopic ultrasound, real-time elastography-endoscopic ultrasound, miniature probe ultrasound, confocal laser endomicroscopy, and the application of artificial intelligence has significantly augmented the diagnostic accuracy of EUS as it enables better evaluation of the number, location, dimension, wall thickness, and contents of these lesions. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the role of the different types of EUS available for the diagnosis and differentiation of pancreatic cancer from other pancreatic lesions while discussing their key strengths and important limitations.",Dahiya DS; Shah YR; Ali H; Chandan S; Gangwani MK; Canakis A; Ramai D; Hayat U; Pinnam BSM; Iqbal A; Malik S; Singh S; Jaber F; Alsakarneh S; Mohamed I; Ali MA; Al-Haddad M; Inamdar S,Journal of clinical medicine,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38731128/,1,0,0,0,0,0

38726306,AI can empower agriculture for global food security: challenges and prospects in developing nations.,"Food and nutrition are a steadfast essential to all living organisms. With specific reference to humans, the sufficient and efficient supply of food is a challenge as the world population continues to grow. Artificial Intelligence (AI) could be identified as a plausible technology in this 5th industrial revolution in bringing us closer to achieving zero hunger by 2030-Goal 2 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG). This goal cannot be achieved unless the digital divide among developed and underdeveloped countries is addressed. Nevertheless, developing and underdeveloped regions fall behind in economic resources; however, they harbor untapped potential to effectively address the impending demands posed by the soaring world population. Therefore, this study explores the in-depth potential of AI in the agriculture sector for developing and under-developed countries. Similarly, it aims to emphasize the proven efficiency and spin-off applications of AI in the advancement of agriculture. Currently, AI is being utilized in various spheres of agriculture, including but not limited to crop surveillance, irrigation management, disease identification, fertilization practices, task automation, image manipulation, data processing, yield forecasting, supply chain optimization, implementation of decision support system (DSS), weed control, and the enhancement of resource utilization. Whereas AI supports food safety and security by ensuring higher crop yields that are acquired by harnessing the potential of multi-temporal remote sensing (RS) techniques to accurately discern diverse crop phenotypes, monitor land cover dynamics, assess variations in soil organic matter, predict soil moisture levels, conduct plant biomass modeling, and enable comprehensive crop monitoring. The present study identifies various challenges, including financial, infrastructure, experts, data availability, customization, regulatory framework, cultural norms and attitudes, access to market, and interdisciplinary collaboration, in the adoption of AI for developing nations with their subsequent remedies.

38722240,"Digital applications for diet monitoring, planning, and precision nutrition for citizens and professionals: a state of the art.","The objective of this review was to critically examine existing digital applications, tailored for use by citizens and professionals, to provide diet monitoring, diet planning, and precision nutrition. We sought to identify the strengths and weaknesses of such digital applications, while exploring their potential contributions to enhancing public health, and discussed potential developmental pathways. Nutrition is a critical aspect of maintaining good health, with an unhealthy diet being one of the primary risk factors for chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Tracking and monitoring one's diet has been shown to help improve health and weight management. However, this task can be complex and time-consuming, often leading to frustration and a lack of adherence to dietary recommendations. Digital applications for diet monitoring, diet generation, and precision nutrition offer the promise of better health outcomes. Data on current nutrition-based digital tools was collected from pertinent literature and software providers. These digital tools have been designed for particular user groups: citizens, nutritionists, and physicians and researchers employing genetics and epigenetics tools. The applications were evaluated in terms of their key functionalities, strengths, and limitations. The analysis primarily concentrated on artificial intelligence algorithms and devices intended to streamline the collection and organization of nutrition data. Furthermore, an exploration was conducted of potential future advancements in this field. Digital applications designed for the use of citizens allow diet self-monitoring, and they can be an effective tool for weight and diabetes management, while digital precision nutrition solutions for professionals can provide scalability, personalized recommendations for patients, and a means of providing ongoing diet support. The limitations in using these digital applications include data accuracy, accessibility, and affordability, and further research and development are required. The integration of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and blockchain technology holds promise for improving the performance, security, and privacy of digital precision nutrition interventions. Multidisciplinarity is crucial for evidence-based and accessible solutions. Digital applications for diet monitoring and precision nutrition have the potential to revolutionize nutrition and health.

38717039,Clinicopathological Characteristics and Risk Factors of Young-Onset Gastric Carcinoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"The characteristics of gastric carcinoma in young individuals differ from that in older individuals. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the clinicopathological features and risk factors associated with young-onset (younger than 50 years) gastric carcinoma. We searched for studies published between January 1, 1990, and September 1, 2023, on patients with young-onset gastric carcinoma in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and MEDLINE to explore clinicopathological characteristics among this specific patient group. Extracted information included the proportion of patients with symptoms or family history of gastric cancer, tumor location, and histological features such as Lauren or World Health Organization histological classification and degree of differentiation. Additional analyses were conducted on risk factors such as positive family history, Helicobacter pylori infection, or high-risk nutritional or behavioral factors. The estimates were derived using random or fixed-effect models and included subgroup analyses based on different sex and age groups. This study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023466131). We identified 5,696 records, 1,292 were included in the quality assessment stage. Finally, 84 studies from 18 countries or regions including 89,447 patients with young-onset gastric carcinoma were included. Young-onset gastric carcinoma has slight female predominance (53.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 51.6-55.7%), with most having symptoms (87.0%, 95% CI: 82.4%-91.7%). Family history was reported in 12.1% (95% CI: 9.5%-14.7%). H. pylori infection was detected in 60.0% of cases (95% CI: 47.1%-72.8%). Most of these carcinomas were in the non-cardia region (89.6%, 95% CI: 82.4%-96.8%), exhibiting Lauren diffuse-type histology (71.1%, 95% CI: 66.8%-75.3%) and poor/undifferentiated features (81.9%, 95% CI%: 79.7-84.2%). A positive family history of gastric cancer was the most important risk factor associated with the development of gastric carcinoma in young individuals (pooled odds ratios 4.0, 95% CI: 2.8-5.2), followed by H. pylori infection (odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI: 1.4-3.2) and dietary and other lifestyle risk factors. Young-onset gastric carcinoma exhibits specific clinicopathological characteristics, with positive family history being the most important risk factor. Most of the patients were symptomatic at diagnosis. These findings could help to inform future strategies for the early detection of gastric carcinoma among young individuals.",Li Y; Hahn AI; Laszkowska M; Jiang F; Zauber AG; Leung WK,Clinical and translational gastroenterology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38717039/,0,1,0,1,0,0

38610020,Nutritional management recommendation systems in polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review.,"People with polycystic ovary syndrome suffer from many symptoms and are at risk of developing diseases such as hypertension and diabetes in the future. Therefore, the importance of self-care doubles. It is mainly to modify the lifestyle, especially following the principles of healthy eating. The purpose of this study is to review artificial intelligence-based systems for providing management recommendations, especially food recommendations. This study started by searching three databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, from inception until 6 June 2023. The result was the retrieval of 15,064 articles. First, we removed duplicate studies. After the title and abstract screening, 119 articles remained. Finally, after reviewing the full text of the articles and considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 20 studies were selected for the study. To assess the quality of articles, we used criteria proposed by Malhotra, Wen, and Kitchenham. Out of the total number of included studies, seventeen studies were high quality, while three studies were moderate quality. Most studies were conducted in India in 2021. Out of all the studies, diagnostic recommendation systems were the most frequently researched, accounting for 86% of the total. Precision, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were more common than other performance metrics. The most significant challenge or limitation encountered in these studies was the small sample size. Recommender systems based on artificial intelligence can help in fields such as prediction, diagnosis, and management of polycystic ovary syndrome.

38575404,Predictors of biochemical response to somatostatin receptor ligands in acromegaly.,"Although predictors of response to first-generation somatostatin receptor ligands (fg-SRLs), and to a lesser extent to pasireotide, have been studied in acromegaly for many years, their use is still not recommended in clinical guidelines. Is there insufficient evidence to use them? Numerous biomarkers including various clinical, functional, radiological and molecular markers have been identified. The first ones are applicable pre-surgery, while the molecular predictors are utilized for patients not cured after surgery. In this regard, factors predicting a good response to fg-SRLs are specifically: low basal GH, a low GH nadir in the acute octreotide test, T2 MRI hypointensity, a densely granulated pattern, high immunohistochemistry staining for somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2), and E-cadherin. However, there is still a lack of consensus regarding which of these biomarkers is more useful or how to integrate them into clinical practice. With classical statistical methods, it is complex to define reliable and generalizable cut-off values for a single biomarker. The potential solution to the limitations of traditional methods involves combining systems biology with artificial intelligence, which is currently providing answers to such long-standing questions that may eventually be finally included into the clinical guidelines and make personalized medicine a reality. The aim of this review is to describe the current knowledge of the main fg-SRLs and pasireotide response predictors, discuss their current usefulness, and point to future directions in the research of this field.",Marazuela M; Martínez-Hernandez R; Marques-Pamies M; Biagetti B; Araujo-Castro M; Puig-Domingo M,Best practice & research.

Artificial Intelligence can support patients or clinicians in diabetes nutrition therapy - the first medical therapy in most cases of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. In particular, ontology-based recommender and decision support systems can deliver a computable representation of experts' knowledge, thus delivering patient-tailored nutritional recommendations or supporting clinical personnel in identifying the most suitable diet. This work proposes a systematic literature review of the domain ontologies describing diabetes in such systems, identifying their underlying conceptualizations, the users targeted by the systems, the type(s) of diabetes tackled, and the nutritional recommendations provided. This review also delves into the structure of the domain ontologies, highlighting several aspects that may hinder (or foster) their adoption in recommender and decision support systems for diabetes nutrition therapy. The results of this review process allow to underline how recommendations are formulated and the role of clinical experts in developing domain ontologies, outlining the research trends characterizing this research area. The results also allow for identifying research directions that can foster a preeminent role for clinical experts and clinical guidelines in a cooperative effort to make ontologies more interoperable - thus enabling them to play a significant role in the decision-making processes about diabetes nutrition therapy.",Spoladore D; Tosi M; Lorenzini EC,Artificial intelligence in medicine,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38564880/,0,1,0,0,0,0

In vitro and ex vivo analysis of these variants revealed hyperactive baseline and cytokine-induced STAT phosphorylation and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) levels compared with wild-type JAK1. A systematic review of electronic health records from the BioME Biobank revealed increased likelihood of clinical presentation with autoimmunity, atopy, colitis, and/or dermatitis in JAK1 variant-positive individuals. Finally, treatment of one affected patient with severe atopic dermatitis using the JAK1/JAK2-selective inhibitor, baricitinib, resulted in clinically significant improvement. These findings suggest that individually rare JAK1 GoF variants may underlie an emerging syndrome with more common presentations of autoimmune and inflammatory disease (JAACD syndrome). More broadly, individuals who present with such conditions may benefit from genetic testing for the presence of JAK1 GoF variants.",Horesh ME; Martin-Fernandez M; Gruber C; Buta S; Le Voyer T; Puzenat E; Lesmana H; Wu Y; Richardson A; Stein D; Hodeib S; Youssef M; Kurowski JA; Feuille E; Pedroza LA; Fuleihan RL; Haseley A; Hovnanian A; Quartier P; Rosain J; Davis G; Mullan D; Stewart O; Patel R; Lee AE; Rubinstein R; Ewald L; Maheshwari N; Rahming V; Chinn IK; Lupski JR; Orange JS; Sancho-Shimizu V; Casanova JL; Abul-Husn NS; Itan Y; Milner JD; Bustamante J; Bogunovic D,The Journal of experimental medicine,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38563820/,0,1,0,0,0,0
38555071,Common and disparate clinical presentations and mechanisms in different eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases.,"Eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases (EGIDs) are a group of diseases characterized by selective eosinophil infiltration of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in the absence of other causes of eosinophilia. These diseases are generally driven by type 2 inflammation, often in response to food allergen exposure. Among all EGIDs, the clinical presentation often includes a history of atopic disease with a variety of GI symptoms. EGIDs are traditionally separated into eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and non-EoE EGIDs. EoE is relatively better understood and now associated with clinical guidelines and 2 US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments, whereas non-EoE EGIDs are rarer and less well-understood diseases without US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments. Non-EoE EGIDs are further subclassified by the area of the GI tract that is involved; they comprise eosinophilic gastritis, eosinophilic enteritis (including eosinophilic duodenitis), and eosinophilic colitis. As with other GI disorders, the disease presentations and mechanisms differ depending on the involved segment of the GI tract; however, the differences between EoE and non-EoE EGIDs extend beyond which GI tract segment is involved. The aim of this article is to summarize the commonalities and differences between the clinical presentations and disease mechanisms for EoE and non-EoE EGIDs.",Shoda T; Taylor RJ; Sakai N; Rothenberg ME,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38555071/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38540996,Digital Anti-Aging Healthcare: An Overview of the Applications of Digital Technologies in Diet Management.,"Diet management has long been an important practice in healthcare, enabling individuals to get an insight into their nutrient intake, prevent diseases, and stay healthy. Traditional methods based on self-reporting, food diaries, and periodic assessments have been used for a long time to control dietary habits. These methods have shown limitations in accuracy, compliance, and real-time analysis. The rapid advancement of digital technologies has revolutionized healthcare, including the diet control landscape, allowing for innovative solutions to control dietary patterns and generate accurate and personalized recommendations. This study examines the potential of digital technologies in diet management and their effectiveness in anti-aging healthcare. After underlining the importance of nutrition in the aging process, we explored the applications of mobile apps, web-based platforms, wearables devices, sensors, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and other technologies in managing dietary patterns and improving health outcomes. The research further examines the effects of digital dietary control on anti-aging healthcare, including improved nutritional monitoring, personalized recommendations, and behavioral and sustainable changes in habits, leading to an expansion of longevity and health span. The challenges and limitations of digital diet monitoring are discussed, and some future directions are provided. Although many digital tools are used in diet control, their accuracy, effectiveness, and impact on health outcomes are not discussed much. This review consolidates the existing literature on digital diet management using emerging digital technologies to analyze their practical implications, guiding researchers, healthcare professionals, and policy makers toward personalized dietary management and healthy aging.",Theodore Armand TP; Kim HC; Kim JI,Journal of personalized medicine,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38540996/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38539568,Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Needle-Based Confocal Endomicroscopy as a Diagnostic Imaging Biomarker for Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms.,"Pancreatic cancer is on track to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths by 2030, yet there is a lack of accurate diagnostic tests for early detection. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are precursors to pancreatic cancer and are increasingly being detected. Despite the development and refinement of multiple guidelines, diagnosing high-grade dysplasia or cancer in IPMNs using clinical, radiologic, endosonographic, and cyst fluid features still falls short in terms of accuracy, leading to both under- and overtreatment. EUS-guided needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (nCLE) is a novel technology that allows real-time optical biopsies of pancreatic cystic lesions. Emerging data has demonstrated that EUS-nCLE can diagnose and risk stratify IPMNs more accurately than conventional diagnostic tools. Implementing EUS-nCLE in clinical practice can potentially improve early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, reduce unnecessary surgeries of IPMNs with low-grade dysplasia, and advance the field of digital pathomics. In this review, we summarize the current evidence that supports using EUS-nCLE as a diagnostic imaging biomarker for diagnosing IPMNs and for risk stratifying their degree of neoplasia. Moreover, we will present emerging data on the role of adding artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to nCLE and integrating novel fluid biomarkers into nCLE.",Krishna S; Abdelbaki A; Hart PA; Machicado JD,Cancers,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38539568/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38534839,Use of Biomaterials in 3D Printing as a Solution to Microbial Infections in Arthroplasty and Osseous Reconstruction.,"The incidence of microbial infections in orthopedic prosthetic surgeries is a perennial problem that increases morbidity and mortality, representing one of the major complications of such medical interventions. The emergence of novel technologies, especially 3D printing, represents a promising avenue of development for reducing the risk of such eventualities. There are already a host of biomaterials, suitable for 3D printing, that are being tested for antimicrobial properties when they are coated with bioactive compounds, such as antibiotics, or combined with hydrogels with antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, such as chitosan and metal nanoparticles, among others. The materials discussed in the context of this paper comprise beta-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP), biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP), hydroxyapatite, lithium disilicate glass, polyetheretherketone (PEEK), poly(propylene fumarate) (PPF), poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC), and zirconia. While the recent research results are promising, further development is required to address the increasing antibiotic resistance exhibited by several common pathogens, the potential for fungal infections, and the potential toxicity of some metal nanoparticles. Other solutions, like the incorporation of phytochemicals, should also be explored. Incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) in the development of certain orthopedic implants and the potential use of AI against bacterial infections might represent viable solutions to these problems. Finally, there are some legal considerations associated with the use of biomaterials and the widespread use of 3D printing, which must be taken into account.",Periferakis A; Periferakis AT; Troumpata L; Dragosloveanu S; Timofticiuc IA; Georgatos-Garcia S; Scheau AE; Periferakis K; Caruntu A; Badarau IA; Scheau C; Caruntu C,"Biomimetics (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38534839/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38533807,Artificial intelligence and machine learning in axial spondyloarthritis.,"To evaluate the current applications and prospects of artificial intelligence and machine learning in diagnosing and managing axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), focusing on their role in medical imaging, predictive modelling, and patient monitoring. Artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, is showing promise in diagnosing axSpA assisting with X-ray, computed tomography (CT) and MRI analyses, with some models matching or outperforming radiologists in detecting sacroiliitis and markers. Moreover, it is increasingly being used in predictive modelling of disease progression and personalized treatment, and could aid risk assessment, treatment response and clinical subtype identification. Variable study designs, sample sizes and the predominance of retrospective, single-centre studies still limit the generalizability of results. Artificial intelligence technologies have significant potential to advance the diagnosis and treatment of axSpA, providing more accurate, efficient and personalized healthcare solutions. However, their integration into clinical practice requires rigorous validation, ethical and legal considerations, and comprehensive training for healthcare professionals. Future advances in artificial intelligence could complement clinical expertise and improve patient care through improved diagnostic accuracy and tailored therapeutic strategies, but the challenge remains to ensure that these technologies are validated in prospective multicentre trials and ethically integrated into patient care.",Adams LC; Bressem KK; Poddubnyy D,Current opinion in rheumatology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38533807/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38516169,Keratoconus: exploring fundamentals and future perspectives - a comprehensive systematic review.,"New developments in artificial intelligence, particularly with promising results in early detection and management of keratoconus, have favorably altered the natural history of the disease over the last few decades. Features of artificial intelligence in different machine such as anterior segment optical coherence tomography, and femtosecond laser technique have improved safety, precision, effectiveness, and predictability of treatment modalities of keratoconus (from contact lenses to keratoplasty techniques). These options ingrained in artificial intelligence are already underway and allow ophthalmologist to approach disease in the most non-invasive way. This study comprehensively describes all of the treatment modalities of keratoconus considering machine learning strategies. A multidimensional comprehensive systematic narrative review. A comprehensive search was done in the five main electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane), without language and time or type of study restrictions. Afterward, eligible articles were selected by screening the titles and abstracts based on main mesh keywords. For potentially eligible articles, the full text was also reviewed. Artificial intelligence demonstrates promise in keratoconus diagnosis and clinical management, spanning early detection (especially in subclinical cases), preoperative screening, postoperative ectasia prediction after keratorefractive surgery, and guiding surgical decisions. The majority of studies employed a solitary machine learning algorithm, whereas minor studies assessed multiple algorithms that evaluated the association of various keratoconus staging and management strategies. Last but not least, AI has proven effective in guiding the implantation of intracorneal ring segments in keratoconus corneas and predicting surgical outcomes. The efficient and widespread clinical translation of machine learning models in keratoconus management is a crucial goal of potential future approaches to better visual performance in keratoconus patients. The article has been registered through PROSPERO, an international database of prospectively registered systematic reviews, with the ID: CRD42022319338.",Niazi S; Gatzioufas Z; Doroodgar F; Findl O; Baradaran-Rafii A; Liechty J; Moshirfar M,Therapeutic advances in ophthalmology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38516169/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38515118,Systems approaches to scaling up: a systematic review and narrative synthesis of evidence for physical activity and other behavioural non-communicable disease risk factors.,"Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading causes of death worldwide. Systems approaches have potential for creating sustainable outcomes at scale but have rarely been used to support scale up in physical activity/nutrition promotion or NCD prevention more generally. This review aimed to: (i) synthesise evidence on the use of systems approaches in scaling up interventions targeting four behavioural risk factors for NCDs; and (ii) to explore how systems approaches have been conceptualised and used in intervention implementation and scale up. Seven electronic databases were searched for studies published 2016-2021. Eligible studies targeted at least one of four NCD behavioural risk factors (physical inactivity, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, diet), or described evaluation of an intervention planned for or scaled up. Studies were categorised as having a (i) high, (ii) moderate, or (iii) no use of a systems approach. A narrative synthesis of how systems approaches had been operationalised in scale up, following PRISMA guidelines. Twenty-one intervention studies were included. Only 19% (n = 4) of interventions explicitly used systems thinking to inform intervention design, implementation and scale up (targeting all four risk factors n = 2, diet n = 1, tobacco use n = 1). Five studies ('high use') planned and implemented scale up with an explicit focus on relations between system elements and used system changes to drive impact at scale. Seven studies ('moderate use') considered systems elements impacting scale-up processes or outcomes but did not require achieving system-level changes from the outset. Nine studies ('no use') were designed to work at multiple levels among multiple agencies in an intervention setting, but the complexity of the system and relations between system elements was not articulated. We synthesised reported barriers and facilitators to scaling up, and how studies within each group conceptualised and used systems approaches, and methods, frameworks and principles for scaling up. In physical activity research, and NCD prevention more broadly, the use of systems approaches in scale up remains in its infancy. For researchers, practitioners and policymakers wishing to adopt systems approaches to intervention implementation at scale, guidance is needed on how to communicate and operationalise systems approaches in research and in practice.

38481969,Requirements for essential micronutrients during caloric restriction and fasting.,"Caloric restriction (CR) or energy restriction, when carefully designed, monitored, and implemented in self-motivated and compliant individuals, proves to be a viable non-pharmacologic strategy for human weight control and obesity management. Beyond its role in weight management, CR has the potential to impede responses involved not only in the pathogenesis of various diseases but also in the aging process in adults, thereby being proposed to promote a healthier and longer life. The core objective of implementing caloric restriction is to establish a balance between energy intake and expenditure, typically involving a reduction in intake and an increase in expenditure-a negative balance at least initially. It may transition toward and maintain a more desired equilibrium over time. However, it is essential to note that CR may lead to a proportional reduction in micronutrient intake unless corresponding supplementation is provided. Historical human case reports on CR have consistently maintained adequate intakes (AI) or recommended dietary allowances (RDA) for essential micronutrients, including vitamins and minerals. Similarly, longevity studies involving non-human primates have upheld micronutrient consumption levels comparable to control groups or baseline measures. Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have also endorsed daily supplementation of multivitamins and minerals to meet micronutrient needs. However, aside from these human case reports, limited human trials, and primate experiments, there remains a notable gap in human research specifically addressing precise micronutrient requirements during CR. While adhering to AI or RDA for minerals and vitamins appears sensible in the current practice, it's important to recognize that these guidelines are formulated for generally healthy populations under standard circumstances. The adequacy of these guidelines in the setting of prolonged and profound negative energy balance remains unclear. From perspectives of evidence-based medicine and precision nutrition, this field necessitates comprehensive exploration to uncover the intricacies of absorption, utilization, and metabolism and the requirement of each hydrophilic and lipophilic vitamin and mineral during these special periods. Such investigations are crucial to determine whether existing daily dietary recommendations for micronutrients are quantitatively inadequate, excessive, or appropriate when energy balance remains negative over extended durations.",Zhang W; Chen P; Huo S; Huang X; Zhao Y,Frontiers in nutrition,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38481969/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38472884,Production Choices and Food Security: A Review of Studies Based on a Micro-Diversity Perspective.,"Given the 'subsistence' character of smallholder production, agricultural production diversification is often seen as an effective strategy for smallholders to improve their diets' diversity and nutritional status, yet the existing evidence remains inadequate. The study applies bibliometric data from the ""Web of Science"" database to synthesize 46 papers from developing countries to explore the relationship between production diversity, dietary diversity, and nutrition in smallholder households. The study identifies the most influential journals, authors, organizations, and countries and reveals research themes related to agricultural production and food security. This data analysis can help researchers target potential collaborators and access influential literature in agricultural production diversity and dietary diversity research. In addition, the results showed that agricultural production diversity potentially influences households' dietary diversity, with mixed results: Agricultural production diversification is the primary way to improve food and nutritional security among smallholder families with low socio-economic status, inaccessible transportation, and poverty; market access and trade have more potential to improve dietary diversity among smallholder households with well-developed markets and higher income levels; the significant measures of agricultural production diversity include Crop Counts, FGPD, SI, and SWDI; the significant measures of dietary diversity include HDDS and IDDS.

38470683,Assessment of Intuitive Eating and Mindful Eating among Higher Education Students: A Systematic Review.,"The role of mindful eating (ME) and intuitive eating (IE) in improving eating behavior, diet quality, and health is an area of increasing interest. The objective of this review was to identify the instruments used to assess ME and IE among higher education students and outcomes related to these dimensions. This review was carried out according to the PRISMA statement, through systematic searches in PubMed, Web of Science, PsycInfo, and Scopus. The inclusion criteria selected for higher education students, levels of ME and/or IE reported, and observational and clinical studies. The exclusion criteria selected against reviews, qualitative studies, and case studies. Quality was assessed using the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Quality Criteria Checklist. A total of 516 initial records were identified, from which 75 were included. Cross-sectional studies were the most common research design (86.7%). Most studies were conducted with samples that were predominantly female (90.7%), White (76.0%), aged 18 to 22 years (88.4%), with BMI < 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (83.0%), and in the United States (61.3%). The Intuitive Eating Scale (IES), the Mindful Eating Questionnaire (MEQ), and their different versions were the most used instruments. The outcomes most studies included were eating behavior and disorders (77.3%), anthropometric assessments (47.8%), mental health (42.0%), and body image (40.6%). Regarding the quality of studies, 34.7% of studies were assigned a positive, 1.3% a negative, and 64.0% a neutral rate. IES and MEQ were the most used instruments.

38467241,Contribution of Sub-Saharan African medicinal plants to cancer research: Scientific basis 2013-2023.,"Cancer incidence and mortality rates are increasing worldwide. Cancer treatment remains a real challenge for African countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa where funding and resources are very limited. High costs, side effects and drug resistance associated with cancer treatment have encouraged scientists to invest in research into new herbal cancer drugs. In order to identify potential anticancer plants for drug development, this review aims to collect and summarize anticancer activities (in vitro/in vivo) and molecular mechanisms of sub-Saharan African medicinal plant extracts against cancer cell lines. Scientific databases such as ScienceDirect, Google Scholar and PubMed were used to search for research articles published from January 2013 to May 2023 on anticancer medicinal plants in sub-Saharan Africa. The data were analyzed to highlight the cytotoxicity and molecular mechanisms of action of these listed plants. A total of 85 research papers covering 204 medicinal plant species were selected for this review. These plants come from 57 families, the most dominant being the plants of the family Amaryllidaceae (16), Fabaceae (14), Annonaceae (10), Asteraceae (10). Plant extracts exert their anticancer activity mainly by inducing apoptosis and stopping the cell cycle of cancer cells. Several plant extracts from sub-Saharan Africa therefore have strong potential for the search for original anticancer phytochemicals. Chemoproteomics, multi-omics, genetic editing technology (CRISPR/Cas9), combined therapies and artificial intelligence tools are cutting edge emerging technologies that facilitate the discovery and structural understanding of anticancer molecules of medicinal plants, reveal their direct targets, explore their therapeutic uses and molecular bases.",Adico MDW; Bayala B; Bunay J; Baron S; Simpore J; Lobaccaro JA,Pharmacological research,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38467241/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38465446,Pediatric endoscopy: how can we improve patient outcomes and ensure best practices?,"Strategies to promote high-quality endoscopy in children require consensus around pediatric-specific quality standards and indicators. Using a rigorous guideline development process, the international Pediatric Endoscopy Quality Improvement Network (PEnQuIN) was developed to support continuous quality improvement efforts within and across pediatric endoscopy services. This review presents a framework, informed by the PEnQuIN guidelines, for assessing endoscopist competence, granting procedural privileges, audit and feedback, and for skill remediation, when required. As is critical for promoting quality, PEnQuIN indicators can be benchmarked at the individual endoscopist, endoscopy facility, and endoscopy community levels. Furthermore, efforts to incorporate technologies, including electronic medical records and artificial intelligence, into endoscopic quality improvement processes can aid in creation of large-scale networks to facilitate comparison and standardization of quality indicator reporting across sites. PEnQuIN quality standards and indicators provide a framework for continuous quality improvement in pediatric endoscopy, benefiting individual endoscopists, endoscopy facilities, and the broader endoscopy community. Routine and reliable measurement of data, facilitated by technology, is required to identify and drive improvements in care. Engaging all stakeholders in endoscopy quality improvement processes is crucial to enhancing patient outcomes and establishing best practices for safe, efficient, and effective pediatric endoscopic care.",Mahoney LB; Huang JS; Lightdale JR; Walsh CM,Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38465446/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38462064,Evaluation of ChatGPT-generated medical responses: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly explored in medical domains. However, the absence of standard guidelines for performance evaluation has led to methodological inconsistencies. This study aims to summarize the available evidence on evaluating ChatGPT's performance in answering medical questions and provide direction for future research. An extensive literature search was conducted on June 15, 2023, across ten medical databases. The keyword used was ""ChatGPT,"" without restrictions on publication type, language, or date. Studies evaluating ChatGPT's performance in answering medical questions were included. Exclusions comprised review articles, comments, patents, non-medical evaluations of ChatGPT, and preprint studies. Data was extracted on general study characteristics, question sources, conversation processes, assessment metrics, and performance of ChatGPT. An evaluation framework for LLM in medical inquiries was proposed by integrating insights from selected literature. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42023456327. A total of 3520 articles were identified, of which 60 were reviewed and summarized in this paper and 17 were included in the meta-analysis. ChatGPT displayed an overall integrated accuracy of 56 % (95 % CI: 51 %-60 %, I<sup>2</sup> = 87 %) in addressing medical queries. However, the studies varied in question resource, question-asking process, and evaluation metrics. As per our proposed evaluation framework, many studies failed to report methodological details, such as the date of inquiry, version of ChatGPT, and inter-rater consistency. This review reveals ChatGPT's potential in addressing medical inquiries, but the heterogeneity of the study design and insufficient reporting might affect the results' reliability. Our proposed evaluation framework provides insights for the future study design and transparent reporting of LLM in responding to medical questions.",Wei Q; Yao Z; Cui Y; Wei B; Jin Z; Xu X,Journal of biomedical informatics,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38462064/,0,1,0,1,0,0

38457125,Biologic therapy in rare eosinophil-associated disorders: remaining questions and translational research opportunities.,"Rare eosinophil-associated disorders (EADs), including hypereosinophilic syndrome, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, are a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by blood and/or tissue hypereosinophilia and eosinophil-related clinical manifestations. Although the recent availability of biologic therapies that directly and indirectly target eosinophils has the potential to dramatically improve treatment options for all EADs, clinical trials addressing their safety and efficacy in rare EADs have been relatively few. Consequently, patient access to therapy is limited for many biologics, and the establishment of evidence-based treatment guidelines has been extremely difficult. In this regard, multicenter retrospective collaborative studies focusing on disease manifestations and treatment responses in rare EADs have provided invaluable data for physicians managing patients with these conditions and helped identify important questions for future translational research. During the Clinical Pre-Meeting Workshop held in association with the July 2023 biennial meeting of the International Eosinophil Society in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, the successes and limitations of pivotal multicenter retrospective studies in EADs were summarized and unmet needs regarding the establishment of guidelines for use of biologics in rare EADs were discussed. Key topics of interest included (1) clinical outcome measures, (2) minimally invasive biomarkers of disease activity, (3) predictors of response to biologic agents, and (4) long-term safety of eosinophil depletion.

38451302,Efficacy of lifestyle interventions in the management of systemic lupus erythematosus: a systematic review of the literature.,"We performed a systematic review to explore existing evidence regarding the efficacy of lifestyle interventions for the management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The search was conducted on the 22nd of June 2021 for publications between 1st of January 2000 and the date of search. Additional articles within the aforementioned timeframe and until December 2023 were added by hand searching. Databases utilized were Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cinahl. Lifestyle interventions were defined as any intervention encompassing one or more of the following: physical exercise, diet and nutrition, mental health, harmful exposures, sleep, and social relations. The Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools were used for risk of bias assessment. The search yielded 11,274 unique records, we assessed the full text of 199 records, and finally included 102 studies. Overall, the quality of the evidence is limited, and there were multiple sources of heterogeneity. The two domains most extensively researched were mental health (40 records) and physical exercise (39 records). Psychological interventions had a positive effect on depressive symptoms, anxiety, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), whereas physical exercise improved fatigue, depressive symptoms, aerobic capacity, and physical functioning. Studies on diet and nutrition (15 records) support that low fat intake and Mediterranean diet may be beneficial for reducing cardiovascular risk, but large interventional studies are lacking. Studies on harmful exposures (7 records) support photoprotection and use of sunscreen. While studies imply benefits regarding disease burden and drug efficacy in non-smokers and regarding HRQoL in normal-weight patients, more survey is needed on tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption, as well as weight control strategies. Studies on social relations (1 record) and sleep (no records) were sparse or non-existent. In conclusion, psychosocial interventions are viable for managing depressive symptoms, and exercise appears essential for reducing fatigue and improving aerobic capacity and physical function. Photoprotection should be recommended to all patients. Lifestyle interventions should be considered a complement, not a substitute, to pharmacotherapy.",Tsoi A; Gomez A; Boström C; Pezzella D; Chow JW; Girard-Guyonvarc'h C; Stamm T; Arnaud L; Parodis I,Rheumatology international,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38451302/,0,1,0,0,0,0
38442341,Understanding and applying gene-environment interactions: a guide for nutrition professionals with an emphasis on integration in African research settings.,"Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are influenced by the interplay between genetics and environmental exposures, particularly diet. However, many healthcare professionals, including nutritionists and dietitians, have limited genetic background and, therefore, they may lack understanding of gene-environment interactions (GxEs) studies. Even researchers deeply involved in nutrition studies, but with a focus elsewhere, can struggle to interpret, evaluate, and conduct GxE studies. There is an urgent need to study African populations that bear a heavy burden of NCDs, demonstrate unique genetic variability, and have cultural practices resulting in distinctive environmental exposures compared with Europeans or Americans, who are studied more. Although diverse and rapidly changing environments, as well as the high genetic variability of Africans and difference in linkage disequilibrium (ie, certain gene variants are inherited together more often than expected by chance), provide unparalleled potential to investigate the omics fields, only a small percentage of studies come from Africa. Furthermore, research evidence lags behind the practices of companies offering genetic testing for personalized medicine and nutrition. We need to generate more evidence on GxEs that also considers continental African populations to be able to prevent unethical practices and enable tailored treatments. This review aims to introduce nutrition professionals to genetics terms and valid methods to investigate GxEs and their challenges, and proposes ways to improve quality and reproducibility. The review also provides insight into the potential contributions of nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics to the healthcare sphere, addresses direct-to-consumer genetic testing, and concludes by offering insights into the field's future, including advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning.",Nienaber-Rousseau C,Nutrition reviews,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38442341/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38438000,Prevalence of Gastric Precursor Lesions in Countries With Differential Gastric Cancer Burden: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"The prevalence of precursor lesions for gastric cancer (GC) and the differential burden between countries of varying GC risk is not well-understood. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the global prevalence of precursor lesions. We estimated the prevalence of atrophic gastritis (AG), gastric intestinal metaplasia (IM), and dysplasia in regions with low, medium, and high GC incidence. Because IM is an advanced manifestation of AG, we assessed the prevalence of less advanced precursors, regardless of the presence of more advanced lesions. Prevalence was sub-stratified by Helicobacter pylori infection, symptomatology, and period (<2000, 2000-2010, and >2010). Among the 582 articles that underwent full-text review, 166 studies met inclusion criteria. The global prevalence estimates of AG, IM, and dysplasia were 25.4%, 16.2%, and 2.0%, respectively, on the basis of 126 studies that reported the prevalence of less advanced precursors, regardless of the presence of more advanced lesions. The prevalence of all precursor lesions was higher in high and medium compared with low GC incidence countries (P < .01). Prevalence of AG and IM was significantly higher among H pylori-infected individuals (P < .01) but not statistically different between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals (P > .17). All precursors demonstrated a secular decrease in prevalence over time. Gastric precursor lesions have differences in prevalence in regions with differential GC incidence and are associated with H pylori infection. Because of the substantial prevalence of precursor lesions in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, symptomatic evaluation may not be sufficient to identify individuals at risk. These estimates provide important insights for tailoring GC prevention strategies.",Mülder DT; Hahn AI; Huang RJ; Zhou MJ; Blake B; Omofuma O; Murphy JD; Gutiérrez-Torres DS; Zauber AG; O'Mahony JF; Camargo MC; Ladabaum U; Yeh JM; Hur C; Lansdorp-Vogelaar I; Meester R; Laszkowska M,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38438000/,0,1,0,1,0,0
38428435,Transforming the cardiometabolic disease landscape: Multimodal AI-powered approaches in prevention and management.,"The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized various scientific fields, particularly in medicine, where it has enabled the modeling of complex relationships from massive datasets. Initially, AI algorithms focused on improved interpretation of diagnostic studies such as chest X-rays and electrocardiograms in addition to predicting patient outcomes and future disease onset. However, AI has evolved with the introduction of transformer models, allowing analysis of the diverse, multimodal data sources existing in medicine today. Multimodal AI holds great promise in more accurate disease risk assessment and stratification as well as optimizing the key driving factors in cardiometabolic disease: blood pressure, sleep, stress, glucose control, weight, nutrition, and physical activity. In this article we outline the current state of medical AI in cardiometabolic disease, highlighting the potential of multimodal AI to augment personalized prevention and treatment strategies in cardiometabolic disease.",Muse ED; Topol EJ,Cell metabolism,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38428435/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38426232,Transforming Big Data into AI-ready data for nutrition and obesity research.,"Big Data are increasingly used in obesity and nutrition research to gain new insights and derive personalized guidance; however, this data in raw form are often not usable. Substantial preprocessing, which requires machine learning (ML), human judgment, and specialized software, is required to transform Big Data into artificial intelligence (AI)- and ML-ready data. These preprocessing steps are the most complex part of the entire modeling pipeline. Understanding the complexity of these steps by the end user is critical for reducing misunderstanding, faulty interpretation, and erroneous downstream conclusions. We reviewed three popular obesity/nutrition Big Data sources: microbiome, metabolomics, and accelerometry. The preprocessing pipelines, specialized software, challenges, and how decisions impact final AI- and ML-ready products were detailed. Opportunities for advances to improve quality control, speed of preprocessing, and intelligent end user consumption were presented. Big Data have the exciting potential for identifying new modifiable factors that impact obesity research. However, to ensure accurate interpretation of conclusions arising from Big Data, the choices involved in preparing AI- and ML-ready data need to be transparent to investigators and clinicians relying on the conclusions.",Thomas DM; Knight R; Gilbert JA; Cornelis MC; Gantz MG; Burdekin K; Cummiskey K; Sumner SCJ; Pathmasiri W; Sazonov E; Gabriel KP; Dooley EE; Green MA; Pfluger A; Kleinberg S,"Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38426232/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38417583,A methodological review of the high-dimensional propensity score in comparative-effectiveness and safety-of-interventions research finds incomplete reporting relative to algorithm development and robustness.,"The use of secondary databases has become popular for evaluating the effectiveness and safety of interventions in real-life settings. However, the absence of important confounders in these databases is challenging. To address this issue, the high-dimensional propensity score (hdPS) algorithm was developed in 2009. This algorithm uses proxy variables for mitigating confounding by combining information available across several healthcare dimensions. This study assessed the methodology and reporting of the hdPS in comparative effectiveness and safety research. In this methodological review, we searched PubMed and Google Scholar from July 2009 to May 2022 for studies that used the hdPS for evaluating the effectiveness or safety of healthcare interventions. Two reviewers independently extracted study characteristics and assessed how the hdPS was applied and reported. Risk of bias was evaluated with the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool. In total, 136 studies met the inclusion criteria; the median publication year was 2018 (Q1-Q3 2016-2020). The studies included 192 datasets, mostly North American databases (n = 132, 69%). The hdPS was used in primary analysis in 120 studies (88%). Dimensions were defined in 101 studies (74%), with a median of 5 (Q1-Q3 4-6) dimensions included. A median of 500 (Q1-Q3 200-500) empirically identified covariates were selected. Regarding hdPS reporting, only 11 studies (8%) reported all recommended items. Most studies (n = 81, 60%) had a moderate overall risk of bias. There is room for improvement in the reporting of hdPS studies, especially regarding the transparency of methodological choices that underpin the construction of the hdPS.",Martin GL; Petri C; Rozenberg J; Simon N; Hajage D; Kirchgesner J; Tubach F; Létinier L; Dechartres A,Journal of clinical epidemiology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38417583/,1,0,0,0,0,0

38395008,The groundbreaking impact of digitalization and artificial intelligence in sheep farming.,"The integration of digitalization and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has marked the onset of a new era of efficient sheep farming in multiple aspects ranging from the general well-being of sheep to advanced web-based management applications. The resultant improvement in sheep health and consequently better farming yield has already started to benefit both farmers and veterinarians. The predictive analytical models embedded with machine learning (giving sense to machines) has helped better decision-making and has enabled farmers to derive most out of their farms. This is evident in the ability of farmers to remotely monitor livestock health by wearable devices that keep track of animal vital signs and behaviour. Additionally, veterinarians now employ advanced AI-based diagnostics for efficient parasite detection and control. Overall, digitalization and AI have completely transformed traditional farming practices in livestock animals. However, there is a pressing need to optimize digital sheep farming, allowing sheep farmers to appreciate and adopt these innovative systems. To fill this gap, this review aims to provide available digital and AI-based systems designed to aid precision farming of sheep, offering an up-to-date understanding on the subject. Various contemporary techniques, such as sky shepherding, virtual fencing, advanced parasite detection, automated counting and behaviour tracking, anomaly detection, precision nutrition, breeding support, and several mobile-based management applications are currently being utilized in sheep farms and appear to be promising. Although artificial intelligence and machine learning may represent key features in the sustainable development of sheep farming, they present numerous challenges in application.",Arshad MF; Burrai GP; Varcasia A; Sini MF; Ahmed F; Lai G; Polinas M; Antuofermo E; Tamponi C; Cocco R; Corda A; Parpaglia MLP,Research in veterinary science,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38395008/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38393083,Freezing Stallion Semen-What Do We Need to Focus on for the Future?,"Artificial insemination (AI) is used frequently in the breeding of sport horses, apart from Thoroughbreds. Most AIs are carried out with cooled semen rather than frozen semen because of the difficulties in identifying a protocol that is suitable for freezing most ejaculates and the necessity to inseminate close to ovulation because of the short life of the thawed spermatozoa. More widespread use of frozen semen would improve biosecurity, allow greater choice of stallions, and offer more flexibility when managing deliveries of semen to the stud. It would even decrease the amount of antibiotics used in semen extenders, since the volume of frozen semen is smaller than when cooled semen is inseminated. However, there is considerable variability in the cryosurvival of spermatozoa from different stallions, leading to the classification of stallions as good or bad freezers. Improvements could be made at the level of stallion nutrition, the semen collection regimen, the extender, the removal of seminal plasma, and the cooling protocol, among others. Stallion sperm membranes are highly susceptible to lipid peroxidation, but research on antioxidants has failed to identify an additive that would benefit all stallions. In the future, biomarkers for sperm freezability could be used as an aid in identifying suitable ejaculates for cryopreservation.",Al-Kass Z; Morrell JM,Veterinary sciences,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38393083/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The case definition was developed by a group of subject matter and BC process experts to facilitate safety data comparability across pre- and post-licensure clinical trials, as well as pharmacovigilance activities in multiple settings with diverse resources and healthcare access. The usual BC case definition development process was followed in an expedited manner, and took two months to complete, including finalising the manuscript for publication, instead of the usual 1 year development time. It includes a systematic review of the literature and an expert consensus to define levels of diagnostic certainty for AIH, and provides specific guidelines for data collection and analysis. Histology, serological and biochemical tests and exclusion of alternate diagnosis were considered necessary to define the levels of certainty (definitive, probable and possible). AEFI reports of suspected AIH were independently classified by the WG members to test its useability and these classifications were used to finalise the case definition. The document underwent peer review by external AIH experts and a Reference Group of vaccine safety stakeholders in high-, low- and middle-income countries to ensure case definition useability, applicability, and scientific integrity. The expedited process can be replicated for development of other standardised case definitions for priority AESIs for endemics and epidemics. While applicable to cases reported following immunisation, the case definition is independent of lapsed time following vaccination and, as such, can also be used to determine background incidence for vaccinated and unvaccinated control groups in studies of causal association. While use of this case definition is also appropriate for the study of safety of other products including drugs, it is not meant to guide clinical case management.",Kochhar S; Assis DN; Mack C; Izurieta HS; Muratori L; Munoz A; Nordenberg D; Gidudu JF; Blau EF; Vierling JM,Vaccine,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38368225/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38361239,Pharmacomicrobiomics: Immunosuppressive Drugs and Microbiome Interactions in Transplantation.,"The human microbiome is associated with human health and disease. Exogenous compounds, including pharmaceutical products, are also known to be affected by the microbiome, and this discovery has led to the field of pharmacomicobiomics. The microbiome can also alter drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, possibly resulting in side effects, toxicities, and unanticipated disease response. Microbiome-mediated effects are referred to as drug-microbiome interactions (DMI). Rapid advances in the field of pharmacomicrobiomics have been driven by the availability of efficient bacterial genome sequencing methods and new computational and bioinformatics tools. The success of fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent Clostridioides difficile has fueled enthusiasm and research in the field. This review focuses on the pharmacomicrobiome in transplantation. Alterations in the microbiome in transplant recipients are well documented, largely because of prophylactic antibiotic use, and the potential for DMI is high. There is evidence that the gut microbiome may alter the pharmacokinetic disposition of tacrolimus and result in microbiome-specific tacrolimus metabolites. The gut microbiome also impacts the enterohepatic recirculation of mycophenolate, resulting in substantial changes in pharmacokinetic disposition and systemic exposure. The mechanisms of these DMI and the specific bacteria or communities of bacteria are under investigation. There are little or no human DMI data for cyclosporine A, corticosteroids, and sirolimus. The available evidence in transplantation is limited and driven by small studies of heterogeneous designs. Larger clinical studies are needed, but the potential for future clinical application of the pharmacomicrobiome in avoiding poor outcomes is high.",Mohamed ME; Saqr A; Staley C; Onyeaghala G; Teigen L; Dorr CR; Remmel RP; Guan W; Oetting WS; Matas AJ; Israni AK; Jacobson PA,Transplantation,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38361239/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38354499,Artificial intelligence image-based prediction models in IBD exhibit high risk of bias: A systematic review.,"There has been an increase in the development of both machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) prediction models in Inflammatory Bowel Disease. We aim in this systematic review to assess the methodological quality and risk of bias of ML and DL IBD image-based prediction studies. We searched three databases, PubMed, Scopus and Embase, to identify ML and DL diagnostic or prognostic predictive models using imaging data in IBD, to Dec 31, 2022. We restricted our search to include studies that primarily used conventional imaging data, were undertaken in human participants, and published in English. Two reviewers independently reviewed the abstracts. The methodological quality of the studies was determined, and risk of bias evaluated using the prediction risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST). Forty studies were included, thirty-nine developed diagnostic models. Seven studies utilized ML approaches, six were retrospective and none used multicenter data for model development. Thirty-three studies utilized DL approaches, ten were prospective, and twelve multicenter studies. Overall, all studies demonstrated high risk of bias. ML studies were evaluated in 4 domains all rated as high risk of bias: participants (6/7), predictors (1/7), outcome (3/7), and analysis (7/7), and DL studies evaluated in 3 domains: participants (24/33), outcome (10/33), and analysis (18/33). The majority of image-based studies used colonoscopy images. The risk of bias was high in AI IBD image-based prediction models, owing to insufficient sample size, unreported missingness and lack of an external validation cohort. Models with a high risk of bias are unlikely to be generalizable and suitable for clinical implementation.",Liu X; Reigle J; Prasath VBS; Dhaliwal J,Computers in biology and medicine,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38354499/,0,1,0,0,0,0

The importance of MNs in common pathologies is recognized by recent research, with deficiencies significantly impacting the outcome. This short version of the guideline aims to provide practical recommendations for clinical practice. An extensive search of the literature was conducted in the databases Medline, PubMed, Cochrane, Google Scholar, and CINAHL for the initial guideline. The search focused on physiological data, historical evidence (for papers published before PubMed release in 1996), and observational and/or randomized trials. For each MN, the main functions, optimal analytical methods, impact of inflammation, potential toxicity, and provision during enteral or parenteral nutrition were addressed. The SOP wording was applied for strength of recommendations. The limited number of interventional trials prevented meta-analysis and led to a low level of evidence for most recommendations. The recommendations underwent a consensus process, which resulted in a percentage of agreement (%): strong consensus required of >90 % of votes. Altogether the guideline proposes 3 general recommendations and specific recommendations for the 26 MNs. Monitoring and management strategies are proposed. This short version of the MN guideline should facilitate handling of the MNs in at-risk diseases, whilst offering practical advice on MN provision and monitoring during nutritional support.",Berger MM; Shenkin A; Dizdar OS; Amrein K; Augsburger M; Biesalski HK; Bischoff SC; Casaer MP; Gundogan K; Lepp HL; de Man AME; Muscogiuri G; Pietka M; Pironi L; Rezzi S; Schweinlin A; Cuerda C,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38350290/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Traditional sow estrus detection depends on the expertise of a farm attendant which can be inconsistent, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. Attempts and trials in developing and implementing technological tools to detect estrus have been explored by researchers. The objective of this review is to assess the automatic methods of estrus recognition in operation for sows and point out their strong and weak points to assist in developing new and improved detection systems. Real-time methods using body and vulvar temperature, posture recognition, and activity measurements show higher precision. Incorporating artificial intelligence with multiple estrus-related parameters is expected to enhance accuracy. Further development of new systems relies mostly upon the improved algorithm and accurate data provided.

38324172,Artificial Intelligence Tools for Improving Manometric Diagnosis of Esophageal Dysmotility.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad term that pertains to a computer's ability to mimic and sometimes surpass human intelligence in interpretation of large datasets. The adoption of AI in gastrointestinal motility has been slower compared to other areas such as polyp detection and interpretation of histopathology. Within esophageal physiologic testing, AI can automate interpretation of image-based tests, especially high resolution manometry (HRM) and functional luminal imaging probe (FLIP) studies. Basic tasks such as identification of landmarks, determining adequacy of the HRM study and identification from achalasia from non-achalasia patterns are achieved with good accuracy. However, existing AI systems compare AI interpretation to expert analysis rather than to clinical outcome from management based on AI diagnosis. The use of AI methods is much less advanced within the field of ambulatory reflux monitoring, where challenges exist in assimilation of data from multiple impedance and pH channels. There remains potential for replication of the AI successes within esophageal physiologic testing to HRM of the anorectum, and to innovative and novel methods of evaluating gastric electrical activity and motor function. The use of AI has tremendous potential to improve detection of dysmotility within the esophagus using esophageal physiologic testing, as well as in other regions of the gastrointestinal tract.

38323150,Non-invasive blood glucose monitoring technology in diabetes management: review.,"Diabetes is one of the leading non-communicable diseases globally, adversely impacting an individual's quality of life and adding a considerable burden to the healthcare systems. The necessity for frequent blood glucose (BG) monitoring and the inconveniences associated with self-monitoring of BG, such as pain and discomfort, has motivated the development of non-invasive BG approaches. However, the current research progress is slow, and only a few BG self-monitoring devices have made considerable progress. Hence, we evaluate the available non-invasive glucose monitoring technologies validated against BG recordings to provide future research direction to design, develop, and deploy self-monitoring of BG with integrated emerging technologies. We searched five databases, Embase, MEDLINE, Proquest, Scopus, and Web of Science, to assess the non-invasive technology's scope in the diabetes management paradigm published from 2000 to 2020. A total of three approaches to non-invasive screening, including saliva, skin, and breath, were identified and discussed. We observed a statistical relationship between BG measurements obtained from non-invasive methods and standard clinical measures. Opportunities exist for future research to advance research progress and facilitate early technology adoption for healthcare practice. The results promise clinical validity; however, formulating regulatory guidelines could foresee the deployment of approved non-invasive BG monitoring technologies in healthcare practice. Further, research prospects are there to design, develop, and deploy integrated diabetes management systems with mobile technologies, data analytics, and the internet of things (IoT) to deliver a personalised monitoring system.",Moses JC; Adibi S; Wickramasinghe N; Nguyen L; Angelova M; Islam SMS,mHealth,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38323150/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38320811,2023 EULAR recommendations on imaging in diagnosis and management of crystal-induced arthropathies in clinical practice.,"To formulate evidence-based recommendations and overarching principles on the use of imaging in the clinical management of crystal-induced arthropathies (CiAs). An international task force of 25 rheumatologists, radiologists, methodologists, healthcare professionals and patient research partners from 11 countries was formed according to the EULAR standard operating procedures. Fourteen key questions on the role of imaging in the most common forms of CiA were generated. The CiA assessed included gout, calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease and basic calcium phosphate deposition disease. Imaging modalities included conventional radiography, ultrasound, CT and MRI. Experts applied research evidence obtained from four systematic literature reviews using MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL. Task force members provided level of agreement (LoA) anonymously by using a Numerical Rating Scale from 0 to 10. Five overarching principles and 10 recommendations were developed encompassing the role of imaging in various aspects of patient management: making a diagnosis of CiA, monitoring inflammation and damage, predicting outcome, response to treatment, guided interventions and patient education. Overall, the LoA for the recommendations was high (8.46-9.92).

38317174,The progressive trend of modeling and drug screening systems of breast cancer bone metastasis.,"Bone metastasis is considered as a considerable challenge for breast cancer patients. Various in vitro and in vivo models have been developed to examine this occurrence. In vitro models are employed to simulate the intricate tumor microenvironment, investigate the interplay between cells and their adjacent microenvironment, and evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions for tumors. The endeavor to replicate the latency period of bone metastasis in animal models has presented a challenge, primarily due to the necessity of primary tumor removal and the presence of multiple potential metastatic sites.The utilization of novel bone metastasis models, including three-dimensional (3D) models, has been proposed as a promising approach to overcome the constraints associated with conventional 2D and animal models. However, existing 3D models are limited by various factors, such as irregular cellular proliferation, autofluorescence, and changes in genetic and epigenetic expression. The imperative for the advancement of future applications of 3D models lies in their standardization and automation. The utilization of artificial intelligence exhibits the capability to predict cellular behavior through the examination of substrate materials' chemical composition, geometry, and mechanical performance. The implementation of these algorithms possesses the capability to predict the progression and proliferation of cancer. This paper reviewed the mechanisms of bone metastasis following primary breast cancer. Current models of breast cancer bone metastasis, along with their challenges, as well as the future perspectives of using these models for translational drug development, were discussed.",Kolahi Azar H; Gharibshahian M; Rostami M; Mansouri V; Sabouri L; Beheshtizadeh N; Rezaei N,Journal of biological engineering,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38317174/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Recently, special attention on this topic has been given in relation to three health statuses: obesity, malnutrition and specific diseases that can be related to food or treated with specific diets. Mobile technology is often used to assist users that wish to regulate their eating habits, and identifying which fields of application have been explored the most by the app developers and which main functionalities have been adopted can be useful in view of future app developments. We selected 322 articles mentioning nutrition support apps through a literature database search, all of which have undergone an initial screening. After the exclusion of papers that were already reviews, not presenting apps or not focused on nutrition, not relevant or not developed for human subjects, 100 papers were selected for subsequent analyses that aimed at identifying the main treated conditions, outcome measures and functionalities implemented in the Apps. Of the selected studies, 33 focus on specific diseases, 24 on obesity, 2 on malnutrition and 41 on other targets (e.g., weight/diet control). Type 2 diabetes is the most targeted disease, followed by gestational diabetes, hypertension, colorectal cancer and CVDs which all were targeted by more than one app. Most Apps include self-monitoring and coaching functionalities, educational content and artificial intelligence (AI) tools are slightly less common, whereas counseling, gamification and questionnaires are the least implemented. Body weight and calories/nutrients were the most common general outcome measures, while glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was the most common clinical outcome. No statistically significant differences in the effectiveness of the different functionalities were found. The use of mobile technology to improve nutrition has been widely explored in the last years, especially for weight control and specific diseases like diabetes; however, other food-related conditions such as Irritable Bowel Diseases appear to be less targeted by newly developed smartphone apps and their related studies. All different kinds of functionalities appear to be equally effective, but further specific studies are needed to confirm the results.",Pala D; Petrini G; Bosoni P; Larizza C; Quaglini S; Lanzola G,International journal of medical informatics,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38295584/,0,1,0,0,0,0
38286392,Non-Host Factors Influencing Onset and Severity of Celiac Disease.,"Celiac disease (CeD) is a chronic autoimmune condition driven by gluten ingestion in genetically predisposed individuals, resulting in inflammatory lesions in the proximal small intestine. Although the presence of specific HLA-linked haplotypes and gluten consumption are necessary for disease development, they alone do not account for the variable onset of CeD in susceptible individuals. This review explores the multifaceted role of non-host factors in CeD development, including dietary and microbial influences. We discuss clinical associations and observations highlighting the impact of these factors on disease onset and severity. Furthermore, we discuss studies in CeD-relevant animal models that offer mechanistic insights into how diet, the microbiome, and enteric infections modulate CeD pathogenesis. Finally, we address the clinical implications and therapeutic potential of understanding these cofactors offering a promising avenue for preventive and therapeutic interventions in CeD management.",Galipeau HJ; Hinterleitner R; Leonard MM; Caminero A,Gastroenterology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38286392/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38283907,Dietary fiber pectin: challenges and potential anti-inflammatory benefits for preterms and newborns.,"Pectins, a class of dietary fibers abundant in vegetables and fruits, have drawn considerable interest due to their potential anti-inflammatory properties. Numerous studies have indicated that incorporating pectins into infant formula could be a safe strategy for alleviating infant regurgitation and diarrhea. Moreover, pectins have been shown to modulate cytokine production, macrophage activity, and NF-kB expression, all contributing to their anti-inflammatory effects. Despite this promising evidence, the exact mechanisms through which pectins exert these functions and how their structural characteristics influence these processes remain largely unexplored. This knowledge is particularly significant in the context of gut inflammation in developing preterm babies, a critical aspect of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and in children and adults dealing with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our mini review aims to provide an up-to-date compilation of relevant research on the effects of pectin on gut immune responses, specifically focusing on preterms and newborns. By shedding light on the underlying mechanisms and implications of pectin-mediated anti-inflammatory properties, this review seeks to advance our knowledge in this area and pave the way for future research and potential therapeutic interventions.",Donadio JLS; Fabi JP; Sztein MB; Salerno-Gonçalves R,Frontiers in nutrition,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38283907/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38270524,Demystification of artificial intelligence for respiratory clinicians managing patients with obstructive lung diseases.,"Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite all available diagnostics and treatments, these conditions pose a significant individual, economic and social burden. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises to support clinical decision-making processes by optimizing diagnosis and treatment strategies of these heterogeneous and complex chronic respiratory diseases. Its capabilities extend to predicting exacerbation risk, disease progression and mortality, providing healthcare professionals with valuable insights for more effective care. Nevertheless, the knowledge gap between respiratory clinicians and data scientists remains a major constraint for wide application of AI and may hinder future progress. This narrative review aims to bridge this gap and encourage AI deployment by explaining its methodology and added value in asthma and COPD diagnosis and treatment. This review offers an overview of the fundamental concepts of AI and machine learning, outlines the key steps in building a model, provides examples of their applicability in asthma and COPD care, and discusses barriers to their implementation. Machine learning can advance our understanding of asthma and COPD, enabling personalized therapy and better outcomes. Further research and validation are needed to ensure the development of clinically meaningful and generalizable models.",Antão J; de Mast J; Marques A; Franssen FME; Spruit MA; Deng Q,Expert review of respiratory medicine,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38270524/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38261299,New molecular tools for precision medicine in pituitary neuroendocrine tumors.,"Precision, personalized, or individualized medicine in pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs) has become a major topic in the last few years. It is based on the use of biomarkers that predictively segregate patients and give answers to clinically relevant questions that help us in the individualization of their management. It allows us to make early diagnosis, predict response to medical treatments, predict surgical outcomes and investigate new targets for therapeutic molecules. So far, substantial progress has been made in this field, although there are still not enough precise tools that can be implemented in clinical practice. One of the main reasons is the excess overlap among clustered patients, with an error probability that is not currently acceptable for clinical practice. This overlap is due to the high heterogeneity of PitNETs, which is too complex to be overcome by the classical biomarker investigation approach. A systems biology approach based on artificial intelligence techniques seems to be able to give answers to each patient individually by building mathematical models through the interaction of multiple factors, including those of omics sciences. Integrated studies of different molecular omics techniques, as well as radiomics and clinical data are necessary to understand the whole system and to finally achieve the key to obtain precise biomarkers and implement personalized medicine. In this review we have focused on describing the current advances in the area of PitNETs based on the omics sciences, that are clearly going to be the new tool for precision medicine.",Marques-Pamies M; Gil J; Valassi E; Pons L; Carrato C; Jordà M; Puig-Domingo M,Minerva endocrinology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38261299/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38251843,Salvage therapy for refractory sudden sensorineural hearing loss (RSSNHL): a systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"Approximately 30-50% of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) patients show poor response to systemic steroid therapy. Additionally, the most appropriate treatment for patients with refractory sudden sensorineural hearing loss (RSSNHL) is unknown. This study aimed to explore the best treatment for RSSNHL. Using a frequentist contrast-based model and PRISMA guidelines, this study compared five salvage regimes: intratympanic injection of steroids (ITS), hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy, post auricle steroid injection (PSI), ITS combined with HBO therapy, and continued systemic steroids. We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases for randomised controlled trials and cohort studies comparing treatment regimens for RSSNHL. Compared with the control group (no additional treatment), PSI and ITS demonstrated significant improvements. The mean hearing gain was greater after PSI (11.1 dB [95% CI, 4.4-17.9]) than after ITS (7.7 dB [95% CI, 4.8-10.7]). When a restricted definition of RSSNHL was used, the ITS + HBO therapy showed the largest difference in improvement for pure tone average compared with the control group (14.5 dB [95% CI, 4.2-25.0]). The administration of either PSI or ITS leads to the greatest therapeutic effect in patients with RSSNHL. However, a consensus on the definition of RSSNHL is needed.",Lin CY; Chang CH; Chang CJ; Ko JY; Wu SY; Kuo PH,International journal of audiology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38251843/,0,1,0,0,0,0
38229141,Risk of flare or relapse in patients with immune-mediated diseases following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Patients with autoimmune and immune-mediated diseases (AI-IMD) are at greater risk of COVID-19 infection; therefore, they should be prioritized in vaccination programs. However, there are concerns regarding the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in terms of disease relapse, flare, or exacerbation. In this study, we aimed to provide a more precise and reliable vision using systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed-MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for original articles reporting the relapse/flare in adult patients with AI-IMD between June 1, 2020 and September 25, 2022. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were conducted to investigate the sources of heterogeneity. Statistical analysis was performed using R software. A total of 134 observations of various AI-IMDs across 74 studies assessed the rate of relapse, flare, or exacerbation in AI-IMD patients. Accordingly, the crude overall prevalence of relapse, flare, or exacerbation was 6.28% (95% CI [4.78%; 7.95%], I<sup>2</sup> = 97.6%), changing from 6.28% (I<sup>2</sup> = 97.6%) to 6.24% (I<sup>2</sup> = 65.1%) after removing the outliers. AI-IMD patients administering mRNA, vector-based, and inactive vaccines showed 8.13% ([5.6%; 11.03%], I<sup>2</sup> = 98.1%), 0.32% ([0.0%; 4.03%], I<sup>2</sup> = 93.5%), and 3.07% ([1.09%; 5.9%], I<sup>2</sup> = 96.2%) relapse, flare, or exacerbation, respectively (p-value = 0.0086). In terms of disease category, nephrologic (26.66%) and hematologic (14.12%) disorders had the highest and dermatologic (4.81%) and neurologic (2.62%) disorders exhibited to have the lowest crude prevalence of relapse, flare, or exacerbation (p-value < 0.0001). The risk of flare/relapse/exacerbation in AI-IMD patients is found to be minimal, especially with vector-based vaccines. Vaccination against COVID-19 is recommended in this population.",Shabani M; Shobeiri P; Nouri S; Moradi Z; Amenu RA; Mehrabi Nejad MM; Rezaei N,European journal of medical research,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38229141/,0,1,0,1,0,0
38201835,Role of Effective Policy and Screening in Managing Pediatric Nutritional Insecurity as the Most Important Social Determinant of Health Influencing Health Outcomes.,"Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) impact nearly half of health outcomes, surpassing the influence of human behavior, clinical care, and the physical environment. SDOH has five domains: Economic Stability, Education Access and Quality, Health Care Access and Quality, Neighborhood and Built Environment, and Social and Community Context. Any adversity arising out of these interlinked domains predominantly affects children due to their greater susceptibility, and the adverse outcomes may span generations. Unfavorable SDOH may cause food insecurity, malnutrition, unbalanced gut microbiome, acute and chronic illnesses, inadequate education, unemployment, and lower life expectancy. Systematic screening by health care workers and physicians utilizing currently available tools and questionnaires can identify children susceptible to adverse childhood experiences, but there is a deficiency with respect to streamlined approach and institutional support. Additionally, current ameliorating supplemental food programs fall short of pediatric nutritional requirements. We propose a nutrition-based Surveillance, Screening, Referral, and Reevaluation (SSRR) plan encompassing a holistic approach to SDOH with a core emphasis on food insecurity, coupled with standardizing outcome-based interventions. We also propose more inclusive use of Food Prescription Programs, tailored to individual children's needs, with emphasis on education and access to healthy food.",Verma H; Verma A; Bettag J; Kolli S; Kurashima K; Manithody C; Jain A,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38201835/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38198849,Nutritional regulation of microbiota-derived metabolites: Implications for immunity and inflammation.,"Nutrition profoundly shapes immunity and inflammation across the lifespan of mammals, from pre- and post-natal periods to later life. Emerging insights into diet-microbiota interactions indicate that nutrition has a dominant influence on the composition-and metabolic output-of the intestinal microbiota, which in turn has major consequences for host immunity and inflammation. Here, we discuss recent findings that support the concept that dietary effects on microbiota-derived metabolites potently alter immune responses in health and disease. We discuss how specific dietary components and metabolites can be either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory in a context- and tissue-dependent manner during infection, chronic inflammation, and cancer. Together, these studies emphasize the influence of diet-microbiota crosstalk on immune regulation that will have a significant impact on precision nutrition approaches and therapeutic interventions for managing inflammation, infection, and cancer immunotherapy.",Arifuzzaman M; Collins N; Guo CJ; Artis D,Immunity,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38198849/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38183164,Deep learning for tooth identification and numbering on dental radiography: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Improved tools based on deep learning can be used to accurately number and identify teeth. This study aims to review the use of deep learning in tooth numbering and identification. An electronic search was performed through October 2023 on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Google Scholar, IEEE, arXiv, and medRxiv. Studies that used deep learning models with segmentation, object detection, or classification tasks for teeth identification and numbering of human dental radiographs were included. For risk of bias assessment, included studies were critically analysed using quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS-2). To generate plots for meta-analysis, MetaDiSc and STATA 17 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA) were used. Pooled outcome diagnostic odds ratios (DORs) were determined through calculation. The initial search yielded 1618 studies, of which 29 were eligible based on the inclusion criteria. Five studies were found to have low bias across all domains of the QUADAS-2 tool. Deep learning has been reported to have an accuracy range of 81.8%-99% in tooth identification and numbering and a precision range of 84.5%-99.94%. Furthermore, sensitivity was reported as 82.7%-98% and F1-scores ranged from 87% to 98%. Sensitivity was 75.5%-98% and specificity was 79.9%-99%. Only 6 studies found the deep learning model to be less than 90% accurate. The average DOR of the pooled data set was 1612, the sensitivity was 89%, the specificity was 99%, and the area under the curve was 96%. Deep learning models successfully can detect, identify, and number teeth on dental radiographs. Deep learning-powered tooth numbering systems can enhance complex automated processes, such as accurately reporting which teeth have caries, thus aiding clinicians in making informed decisions during clinical practice.",Sadr S; Rokhshad R; Daghighi Y; Golkar M; Tolooie Kheybari F; Gorjinejad F; Mataji Kojori A; Rahimirad P; Shobeiri P; Mahdian M; Mohammad-Rahimi H,Dento maxillo facial radiology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38183164/,0,1,0,1,0,0
38178326,Advanced endoscopic imaging for detection of Barrett's esophagus.,"Barrett's esophagus (BE) is the precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), and is caused by chronic gastroesophageal reflux. BE can progress over time from metaplasia to dysplasia, and eventually to EAC. EAC is associated with a poor prognosis, often due to advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. However, if BE is diagnosed early, pharmacologic and endoscopic treatments can prevent progression to EAC. The current standard of care for BE surveillance utilizes the Seattle protocol. Unfortunately, a sizable proportion of early EAC and BE-related high-grade dysplasia (HGD) are missed due to poor adherence to the Seattle protocol and sampling errors. New modalities using artificial intelligence (AI) have been proposed to improve the detection of early EAC and BE-related HGD. This review will focus on AI technology and its application to various endoscopic modalities such as high-definition white light endoscopy, narrow-band imaging, and volumetric laser endomicroscopy.",Zilberstein N; Godbee M; Mehta NA; Waxman I,Clinical endoscopy,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38178326/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38175857,Role of Artificial Intelligence in Multinomial Decisions and Preventative Nutrition in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects 50 million people worldwide, an increase of 35 million since 2015, and it is known for memory loss and cognitive decline. Considering the morbidity associated with AD, it is important to explore lifestyle elements influencing the chances of developing AD, with special emphasis on nutritional aspects. This review will first discuss how dietary factors have an impact in AD development and the possible role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in preventative care of AD patients through nutrition. The Mediterranean-DASH diets provide individuals with many nutrient benefits which assists the prevention of neurodegeneration by having neuroprotective roles. Lack of micronutrients, protein-energy, and polyunsaturated fatty acids increase the chance of cognitive decline, loss of memory, and synaptic dysfunction among others. ML software has the ability to design models of algorithms from data introduced to present practical solutions that are accessible and easy to use. It can give predictions for a precise medicine approach to evaluate individuals as a whole. There is no doubt the future of nutritional science lies on customizing diets for individuals to reduce dementia risk factors, maintain overall health and brain function.",Soares Dias Portela A; Saxena V; Rosenn E; Wang SH; Masieri S; Palmieri J; Pasinetti GM,Molecular nutrition & food research,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38175857/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38142698,Profiling the dysregulated immune response in sepsis: overcoming challenges to achieve the goal of precision medicine.,"Sepsis is characterised by a dysregulated host immune response to infection. Despite recognition of its significance, immune status monitoring is not implemented in clinical practice due in part to the current absence of direct therapeutic implications. Technological advances in immunological profiling could enhance our understanding of immune dysregulation and facilitate integration into clinical practice. In this Review, we provide an overview of the current state of immune profiling in sepsis, including its use, current challenges, and opportunities for progress. We highlight the important role of immunological biomarkers in facilitating predictive enrichment in current and future treatment scenarios. We propose that multiple immune and non-immune-related parameters, including clinical and microbiological data, be integrated into diagnostic and predictive combitypes, with the aid of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. These combitypes could form the basis of workable algorithms to guide clinical decisions that make precision medicine in sepsis a reality and improve patient outcomes.",Cajander S; Kox M; Scicluna BP; Weigand MA; Mora RA; Flohé SB; Martin-Loeches I; Lachmann G; Girardis M; Garcia-Salido A; Brunkhorst FM; Bauer M; Torres A; Cossarizza A; Monneret G; Cavaillon JM; Shankar-Hari M; Giamarellos-Bourboulis EJ; Winkler MS; Skirecki T; Osuchowski M; Rubio I; Bermejo-Martin JF; Schefold JC; Venet F,The Lancet.

38138456,Research Progress of Rapid Non-Destructive Detection Technology in the Field of Apple Mold Heart Disease.,"Apples are rich in vitamins and dietary fiber and are one of the essential fruits in people's daily diet. China has always been a big apple consumer, and with the improvement of people's life quality, nutrition, and health requirements, the demand for high-quality apples has increased year by year. Apple mold heart disease is one of the main diseases affecting apple quality. However, this disease cannot be easily detected from the surface, so it is difficult to detect mold heart disease. Therefore, this paper focuses on the analysis of seven non-destructive detection technologies, including near infrared spectroscopy technology, hyperspectral technology, Raman spectroscopy technology, electronic nose technology, acoustic technology, electrical technology, and magnetic technology, summarizes their application status in the detection of apple mold heart disease, and then analyzes their advantages and disadvantages. Combined with the current rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, this paper proposes the future development trends of using non-destructive technologies to detect apple mold heart disease. It is expected to provide basic theory and application references for the intelligent detection of apple mold heart disease.",Li Y; Yang Z; Wang W; Wang X; Zhang C; Dong J; Bai M; Hui T,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38138456/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38125058,Beyond the horizon: Innovations and future directions in axial-spondyloarthritis.,"Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the spine and sacroiliac joints. This review discusses recent advances across multiple scientific fields that promise to transform axSpA management. Traditionally, axSpA was considered an immune-mediated disease driven by human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27), interleukin (IL)-23/IL-17 signaling, biomechanics, and dysbiosis. Diagnosis relies on clinical features, laboratory tests, and imaging, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) nowadays. Management includes exercise, lifestyle changes, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and if this is not sufficient to achieve disease control also biological and targeted-synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. Beyond long-recognized genetic risks like HLA-B27, high-throughput sequencing has revealed intricate gene-environment interactions influencing dysbiosis, immune dysfunction, and aberrant bone remodeling. Elucidating these mechanisms promises screening approaches to enable early intervention. Advanced imaging is revolutionizing the assessment of axSpA's hallmark: sacroiliac bone-marrow edema indicating inflammation. Novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques sensitively quantify disease activity, while machine learning automates complex analysis to improve diagnostic accuracy and monitoring. Hybrid imaging like synthetic MRI/computed tomography (CT) visualizes structural damage with new clarity. Meanwhile, microbiome analysis has uncovered gut ecosystem alterations that may initiate joint inflammation through HLA-B27 misfolding or immune subversion. Correcting dysbiosis represents an enticing treatment target. Moving forward, emerging techniques must augment patient care. Incorporating patient perspectives will be key to ensure innovations like genetics, microbiome, and imaging biomarkers translate into improved mobility, reduced pain, and increased quality of life. By integrating cutting-edge, multidisciplinary science with patients' lived experience, researchers can unlock the full potential of new technologies to deliver transformative outcomes. The future is bright for precision diagnosis, tightly controlled treatment, and even prevention of axSpA.",Venerito V; Del Vescovo S; Lopalco G; Proft F,Archives of rheumatology,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38125058/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38110000,High Dosage Omega-3 Fatty Acids Outperform Existing Pharmacological Options for Migraine Prophylaxis: A Network Meta-Analysis.,"Migraine is a highly prevalent neurologic disorder with prevalence rates ranging from 9% to 18% worldwide. Current pharmacologic prophylactic strategies for migraine have limited efficacy and acceptability, with relatively low response rates of 40% to 50% and limited safety profiles. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are considered promising therapeutic agents for migraine prophylaxis. The aim of this network meta-analysis (NMA) was to compare the efficacy and acceptability of various dosages of EPA/DHA and other current Food and Drug Administration-approved or guideline-recommended prophylactic pharmacologic interventions for migraine. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible for inclusion if they enrolled participants with a diagnosis of either episodic or chronic migraine. All NMA procedures were conducted under the frequentist model. The primary outcomes assessed were 1) changes in migraine frequency and 2) acceptability (i.e., dropout for any reason). Secondary outcomes included response rates, changes in migraine severity, changes in the frequency of using rescue medications, and frequency of any adverse events. Forty RCTs were included (N = 6616; mean age = 35.0 y; 78.9% women). Our analysis showed that supplementation with high dosage EPA/DHA yields the highest decrease in migraine frequency [standardized mean difference (SMD): -1.36; 95% confidence interval (CI): -2.32, -0.39 compared with placebo] and the largest decrease in migraine severity (SMD: -2.23; 95% CI: -3.17, -1.30 compared with placebo) in all studied interventions. Furthermore, supplementation with high dosage EPA/DHA showed the most favorable acceptability rates (odds ratio: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.06, 17.41 compared with placebo) of all examined prophylactic treatments. This study provides compelling evidence that high dosage EPA/DHA supplementation can be considered a first-choice treatment of migraine prophylaxis because this treatment displayed the highest efficacy and highest acceptability of all studied treatments. This study was registered in PROSPERO as CRD42022319577.",Tseng PT; Zeng BY; Chen JJ; Kuo CH; Zeng BS; Kuo JS; Cheng YS; Sun CK; Wu YC; Tu YK; Stubbs B; Carvalho AF; Liang CS; Chen TY; Hsu CW; Suen MW; Yang CP; Hsu SP; Chen YW; Shiue YL; Hung CM; Su KP; Lin PY,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38110000/,1,0,0,0,0,0

38104745,Unveiling drug induced nephrotoxicity using novel biomarkers and cutting-edge preventive strategies.,"Drug-induced nephrotoxicity is still a significant obstacle in pharmacotherapy of various diseases and it accounts for around 25 % of serious side-effects reported after drug administration. Furthermore, some groups of drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, antiviral drugs, antifungal drugs, immunosuppressants, and chemotherapeutic drugs have the ""preference"" for damaging the kidney and are often referred to as the kidney's ""silent killer"". Clinically, the onset of acute kidney injury associated with drug administration is registered in approximately 20 % of patients and many of them develop chronic kidney disease vulnerability. However, current knowledge about the mechanisms underlying this dangerous phenomenon is still insufficient with many unknowns. Hence, the valuable use of these drugs in clinical practice is significantly limited. The main aim of this study is to draw attention to commonly prescribed nephrotoxic drugs by clinicians or drugs bought over the counter. In addition, the complex relationship between immunological, vascular and inflammatory events that promote kidney damage is discussed. The practical use of this knowledge could be implemented in the engineering of novel biomarkers for early detection of drug-associated kidney damage such as Kidney Injury Molecule (KIM-1), lipocalin associated with neutrophil gelatinase (NGAL) and various microRNAs. In addition, the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) for the development of computer algorithms that could detect kidney damage at an early stage should be further explored. Therefore, this comprehensive review provides a new outlook on drug nephrotoxicity that opens the door for further clinical research of novel potential drugs or natural products for the prevention of drug-induced nephrotoxicity and accessible education.",Džidić-Krivić A; Sher EK; Kusturica J; Farhat EK; Nawaz A; Sher F,Chemico-biological interactions,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38104745/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38102985,The 2023 Orthopaedic Research Society's International Consensus Meeting on musculoskeletal infection: Summary from the host immunity section.,"Musculoskeletal infections (MSKI), which are a major problem in orthopedics, occur when the pathogen eludes or overwhelms the host immune system. While effective vaccines and immunotherapies to prevent and treat MSKI should be possible, fundamental knowledge gaps in our understanding of protective, nonprotective, and pathogenic host immunity are prohibitive. We also lack critical knowledge of how host immunity is affected by the microbiome, implants, prior infection, nutrition, antibiotics, and concomitant therapies, autoimmunity, and other comorbidities. To define our current knowledge of these critical topics, a Host Immunity Section of the 2023 Orthopaedic Research Society MSKI International Consensus Meeting (ICM) proposed 78 questions. Systematic reviews were performed on 15 of these questions, upon which recommendations with level of evidence were voted on by the 72 ICM delegates, and another 12 questions were voted on with a recommendation of ""Unknown"" without systematic reviews. Two questions were transferred to another ICM Section, and the other 45 were tabled for future consideration due to limitations of available human resources. Here we report the results of the voting with internet access to the questions, recommendations, and rationale from the systematic reviews. Eighteen questions received a consensus vote of ≥90%, while nine recommendations failed to achieve this threshold. Commentary on why consensus was not achieved on these questions and potential ways forward are provided to stimulate specific funding mechanisms and research on these critical MSKI host defense questions.",Schwarz EM; Archer NK; Atkins GJ; Bentley KLM; Botros M; Cassat JE; Chisari E; Coraça-Huber DC; Daiss JL; Gill SR; Goodman SB; Harro J; Hernandez CJ; Ivashkiv LB; Kates SL; Marques CNH; Masters EA; Muthukrishnan G; Owen JR; Raafat D; Saito M; Veis DJ; Xie C,Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38102985/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38060823,AI-based digital image dietary assessment methods compared to humans and ground truth: a systematic review.,"Human error estimating food intake is a major source of bias in nutrition research. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods may reduce bias, but the overall accuracy of AI estimates is unknown. This study was a systematic review of peer-reviewed journal articles comparing fully automated AI-based (e.g. deep learning) methods of dietary assessment from digital images to human assessors and ground truth (e.g. doubly labelled water). Literature was searched through May 2023 in four electronic databases plus reference mining. Eligible articles reported AI estimated volume, energy, or nutrients. Independent investigators screened articles and extracted data. Potential sources of bias were documented in absence of an applicable risk of bias assessment tool. Database and hand searches identified 14,059 unique publications; fifty-two papers (studies) published from 2010 to 2023 were retained. For food detection and classification, 79% of papers used a convolutional neural network. Common ground truth sources were calculation using nutrient tables (51%) and weighed food (27%). Included papers varied widely in food image databases and results reported, so meta-analytic synthesis could not be conducted. Relative errors were extracted or calculated from 69% of papers. Average overall relative errors (AI vs. ground truth) ranged from 0.10% to 38.3% for calories and 0.09% to 33% for volume, suggesting similar performance. Ranges of relative error were lower when images had single/simple foods. Relative errors for volume and calorie estimations suggest that AI methods align with - and have the potential to exceed - accuracy of human estimations. However, variability in food image databases and results reported prevented meta-analytic synthesis.

38042683,Predictors of Response to Treatment with First-Generation Somatostatin Receptor Ligands in Patients with Acromegaly.,"Predictors of first-generation somatostatin receptor ligands (fgSRLs) response in acromegaly have been studied for over 30 years, but they are still not recommended in clinical guidelines. Is there not enough evidence to support their use? This systematic review aims to describe the current knowledge of the main predictors of fgSRLs response and discuss their current usefulness, as well as future research directions. A systematic search was performed in the Scopus and PubMed databases for functional, imaging, and molecular predictive factors. A total of 282 articles were detected, of which 64 were included. Most of them are retrospective studies performed between 1990 and 2023 focused on the predictive response to fgSRLs in acromegaly. The usefulness of the predictive factors is confirmed, with good response identified by the most replicated factors, specifically low GH nadir in the acute octreotide test, T2 MRI hypointensity, high Somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) and E-cadherin expression, and a densely granulated pattern. Even if these biomarkers are interrelated, the association is quite heterogeneous. With classical statistical methods, it is complex to define reliable and generalizable cut-off values worth recommending in clinical guidelines. Machine-learning models involving omics are a promising approach to achieve the highest accuracy values to date. This survey confirms a sufficiently robust level of evidence to apply knowledge of predictive factors for greater efficiency in the treatment decision process. The irruption of artificial intelligence in this field is providing definitive answers to such long-standing questions that may change clinical guidelines and make personalized medicine a reality.",Marques-Pamies M; Gil J; Jordà M; Puig-Domingo M,Archives of medical research,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38042683/,0,1,0,0,0,0
38035357,Advancing sustainability in the food and nutrition system: a review of artificial intelligence applications.,"Promoting sustainability in food and nutrition systems is essential to address the various challenges and trade-offs within the current food system. This imperative is guided by key principles and actionable steps, including enhancing productivity and efficiency, reducing waste, adopting sustainable agricultural practices, improving economic growth and livelihoods, and enhancing resilience at various levels. However, in order to change the current food consumption patterns of the world and move toward sustainable diets, as well as increase productivity in the food production chain, it is necessary to employ the findings and achievements of other sciences. These include the use of artificial intelligence-based technologies. Presented here is a narrative review of possible applications of artificial intelligence in the food production chain that could increase productivity and sustainability. In this study, the most significant roles that artificial intelligence can play in enhancing the productivity and sustainability of the food and nutrition system have been examined in terms of production, processing, distribution, and food consumption. The research revealed that artificial intelligence, a branch of computer science that uses intelligent machines to perform tasks that require human intelligence, can significantly contribute to sustainable food security. Patterns of production, transportation, supply chain, marketing, and food-related applications can all benefit from artificial intelligence. As this review of successful experiences indicates, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data are a boon to the goal of sustainable food security as they enable us to achieve our goals more efficiently.",Namkhah Z; Fatemi SF; Mansoori A; Nosratabadi S; Ghayour-Mobarhan M; Sobhani SR,Frontiers in nutrition,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38035357/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38031838,Understanding HDL Metabolism and Biology Through In Vivo Tracer Kinetics.,"HDL (high-density lipoprotein), owing to its high protein content and small size, is the densest circulating lipoprotein. In contrast to lipid-laden VLDL (very-low-density lipoprotein) and LDL (low-density lipoprotein) that promote atherosclerosis, HDL is hypothesized to mitigate atherosclerosis via reverse cholesterol transport, a process that entails the uptake and clearance of excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues. This process is mediated by APOA1 (apolipoprotein A-I), the primary structural protein of HDL, as well as by the activities of additional HDL proteins. Tracer-dependent kinetic studies are an invaluable tool to study HDL-mediated reverse cholesterol transport and overall HDL metabolism in humans when a cardiovascular disease therapy is investigated. Unfortunately, HDL cholesterol-raising therapies have not been successful at reducing cardiovascular events suggesting an incomplete picture of HDL biology. However, as HDL tracer studies have evolved from radioactive isotope- to stable isotope-based strategies that in turn are reliant on mass spectrometry technologies, the complexity of the HDL proteome and its metabolism can be more readily addressed. In this review, we outline the motivations, timelines, advantages, and disadvantages of the various tracer kinetics strategies. We also feature the metabolic properties of select HDL proteins known to regulate reverse cholesterol transport, which in turn underscore that HDL lipoproteins comprise a heterogeneous particle population whose distinct protein constituents and kinetics likely determine its function and potential contribution to cholesterol clearance.",Andraski AB; Sacks FM; Aikawa M; Singh SA,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38031838/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38007143,A hypothesis: Potential contributions of metals to the pathogenesis of pulmonary artery hypertension.,"Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is characterized by vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling resulting in both increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). The chronic and high-pressure stress experienced by endothelial cells can give rise to inflammation, oxidative stress, and infiltration by immune cells. However, there is no clearly defined mechanism for PAH and available treatment options only provide limited symptomatic relief. Due to the far-reaching effects of metal exposures, the interaction between metals and the pulmonary vasculature is of particular interest. This review will briefly introduce the pathophysiology of PAH and then focus on the potential roles of metals, including essential and non-essential metals in the pathogenic process in the pulmonary arteries and right heart, which may be linked to PAH. Based on available data from human studies of occupational or environmental metal exposure, including lead, antimony, iron, and copper, the hypothesis of metals contributing to the pathogenesis of PAH is proposed as potential risk factors and underlying mechanisms for PAH. We propose that metals may initiate or exacerbate the pathogenesis of PAH, by providing potential mechanism by which metals interact with hypoxia-inducible factor and tumor suppressor p53 to modulate their downstream cellular proliferation pathways. These need further investigation. Additionally, we present future research directions on roles of metals in PAH.",Hopkins CD; Wessel C; Chen O; El-Kersh K; Cathey D; Cave MC; Cai L; Huang J,Life sciences,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38007143/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38004597,The Trends and Future Prospective of In Silico Models from the Viewpoint of ADME Evaluation in Drug Discovery.,"Drug discovery and development are aimed at identifying new chemical molecular entities (NCEs) with desirable pharmacokinetic profiles for high therapeutic efficacy. The plasma concentrations of NCEs are a biomarker of their efficacy and are governed by pharmacokinetic processes such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Poor ADME properties of NCEs are a major cause of attrition in drug development. ADME screening is used to identify and optimize lead compounds in the drug discovery process. Computational models predicting ADME properties have been developed with evolving model-building technologies from a simplified relationship between ADME endpoints and physicochemical properties to machine learning, including support vector machines, random forests, and convolution neural networks. Recently, in the field of in silico ADME research, there has been a shift toward evaluating the in vivo parameters or plasma concentrations of NCEs instead of using predictive results to guide chemical structure design. Another research hotspot is the establishment of a computational prediction platform to strengthen academic drug discovery. Bioinformatics projects have produced a series of in silico ADME models using free software and open-access databases. In this review, we introduce prediction models for various ADME parameters and discuss the currently available academic drug discovery platforms.",Komura H; Watanabe R; Mizuguchi K,Pharmaceutics,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38004597/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38003976,"A Review of the Resistance Mechanisms for <i>β</i>-Lactams, Macrolides and Fluoroquinolones among <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>.","<i>Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae)</i> is a bacterial species often associated with the occurrence of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). CAP refers to a specific kind of pneumonia that occurs in individuals who acquire the infection outside of a healthcare setting. It represents the leading cause of both death and morbidity on a global scale. Moreover, the declaration of <i>S. pneumoniae</i> as one of the 12 leading pathogens was made by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2017. Antibiotics like <i>β</i>-lactams, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones are the primary classes of antimicrobial medicines used for the treatment of <i>S. pneumoniae</i> infections. Nevertheless, the efficacy of these antibiotics is diminishing as a result of the establishment of resistance in <i>S. pneumoniae</i> against these antimicrobial agents. In 2019, the WHO declared that antibiotic resistance was among the top 10 hazards to worldwide health. It is believed that penicillin-binding protein genetic alteration causes <i>β</i>-lactam antibiotic resistance. Ribosomal target site alterations and active efflux pumps cause macrolide resistance. Numerous factors, including the accumulation of mutations, enhanced efflux mechanisms, and plasmid gene acquisition, cause fluoroquinolone resistance. Furthermore, despite the advancements in pneumococcal vaccinations and artificial intelligence (AI), it is not feasible for individuals to rely on them indefinitely. The ongoing development of AI for combating antimicrobial resistance necessitates more research and development efforts. A few strategies can be performed to curb this resistance issue, including providing educational initiatives and guidelines, conducting surveillance, and establishing new antibiotics targeting another part of the bacteria. Hence, understanding the resistance mechanism of <i>S. pneumoniae</i> may aid researchers in developing a more efficacious antibiotic in future endeavors.",Zahari NIN; Engku Abd Rahman ENS; Irekeola AA; Ahmed N; Rabaan AA; Alotaibi J; Alqahtani SA; Halawi MY; Alamri IA; Almogbel MS; Alfaraj AH; Ibrahim FA; Almaghaslah M; Alissa M; Yean CY,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38003976/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Early prediction of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) may accelerate the diagnosis and guide preventive interventions. The performance of a variety of machine learning-based prediction models were analyzed among adults undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the Cochrane Collaboration. Machine learning-based prediction models were identified from a search of nine multi-disciplinary databases. Two authors independently selected and extracted data using predefined criteria and data extraction forms. The predictive performance, the interpretability, the technological readiness level, and the risk of bias of the included studies were evaluated. Final analysis included 10 static prediction models using supervised learning. The pooled area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, sensitivity, and specificity for VAP were 0.88 (95 % CI 0.82-0.94, I<sup>2</sup> 98.4 %), 0.72 (95 % CI 0.45-0.98, I<sup>2</sup> 97.4 %) and 0.90 (95 % CI 0.85-0.94, I<sup>2</sup> 97.9 %), respectively. All included studies had either a high or unclear risk of bias without significant improvements in applicability. The care-related risk factors for the best performing models were the duration of mechanical ventilation, the length of ICU stay, blood transfusion, nutrition strategy, and the presence of antibiotics. A variety of the prediction models, prediction intervals, and prediction windows were identified to facilitate timely diagnosis. In addition, care-related risk factors susceptible for preventive interventions were identified. In future, there is a need for dynamic machine learning models using time-depended predictors in conjunction with feature importance of the models to predict real-time risk of VAP and related outcomes to optimize bundled care.",Frondelius T; Atkova I; Miettunen J; Rello J; Vesty G; Chew HSJ; Jansson M,European journal of internal medicine,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37981529/,0,1,0,1,0,0

Hence, chronic diseases are a pressing health concern and will continue to be in decades to come. Chronic diseases often involve multiple malfunctioning organs in the body. An imminent question is how interorgan crosstalk contributes to the etiology of chronic diseases. We conceived the locked-state model (LoSM), which illustrates how interorgan communication can give rise to body-wide memory-like properties that 'lock' healthy or pathological conditions. Next, we propose cutting-edge systems biology and artificial intelligence strategies to decipher chronic multiorgan locked states. Finally, we discuss the clinical implications of the LoSM and assess the power of systems-based therapies to dismantle pathological multiorgan locked states while improving treatments for chronic diseases.",Ung CY; Correia C; Li H; Adams CM; Westendorf JJ; Zhu S,Drug discovery today,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37967790/,1,0,0,0,0,0

37955263,The Potential of Meta-Proteomics and Artificial Intelligence to Establish the Next Generation of Probiotics for Personalized Healthcare.,"The symbiosis of probiotic bacteria with humans has rendered various health benefits while providing nutrition and a suitable environment for their survival. However, the probiotics must survive unfavorable gut conditions to exert beneficial effects. The intrinsic resistance of probiotics to survive harsh conditions results from a myriad of proteins. Interaction of microbial proteins with the host is indispensable for modulating the gut microbiome, such as interaction with cell receptors and protective action against pathogens. The complex interplay of proteins should be unraveled by utilizing metaproteomic strategies. The contribution of probiotics to health is now widely accepted. However, due to the inconsistency of generalized probiotics, contemporary research toward precision probiotics has gained momentum for customized treatment. This review explores the application of metaproteomics and AI/ML algorithms in resolving multiomics data analysis and <i>in silico</i> prediction of microbial features for screening specific beneficial probiotic organisms.

37947095,Genome-Wide Assessment of Shared Genetic Architecture Between Rheumatoid Arthritis and Cardiovascular Diseases.,"Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have a 2- to 10-fold increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), but the biological mechanisms and existence of causality underlying such associations remain to be investigated. We aimed to investigate the genetic associations and underlying mechanisms between RA and CVD by leveraging large-scale genomic data and genetic cross-trait analytic approaches. Within UK Biobank data, we examined the genetic correlation, shared genetics, and potential causality between RA (N<sub>cases</sub>=6754, N<sub>controls</sub>=452 384) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD, N<sub>cases</sub>=44 238, N<sub>controls</sub>=414 900) using linkage disequilibrium score regression, cross-trait meta-analysis, and Mendelian randomization. We observed significant genetic correlations of RA with myocardial infarction (r<sub>g</sub>:0.40 [95% CI, 0.24-0.56), angina (r<sub>g</sub>:0.42 [95% CI, 0.28-0.56]), coronary heart diseases (r<sub>g</sub>:0.41 [95% CI, 0.27-0.55]), and CVD (r<sub>g</sub>:0.43 [95% CI, 0.29-0.57]) after correcting for multiple testing (<i>P</i><0.05/5). When stratified by frequent use of analgesics, we found increased genetic correlation between RA and CVD among participants without aspirin usage (r<sub>g</sub>:0.54 [95% CI, 0.30-0.78] for angina; <i>P</i><sub>value</sub>=6.69×10<sup>-6</sup>) and among participants with paracetamol usage (r<sub>g</sub>:0.75 [95% CI, 0.20-1.29] for myocardial infarction; <i>P</i><sub>value</sub>=8.90×10<sup>-3</sup>), whereas others remained similar. Cross-trait meta-analysis identified 9 independent shared loci between RA and CVD, including <i>PTPN22</i> at <i>chr1p13.2</i>, <i>BCL2L11</i> at <i>chr2q13</i>, and <i>CCR3</i> at <i>chr3p21.31</i> (<i>P</i><sub>single trait</sub><1×10<sup>-3</sup> and <i>P</i><sub>meta</sub><5×10<sup>-8</sup>), highlighting potential shared pathogenesis including accelerating atherosclerosis, upregulating oxidative stress, and vascular permeability.

The chronic stress leads to inflammation, oxidative stress, and infiltration by immune cells. Roles of metals in these diseases, particularly PH are largely unknown. This review first discusses the pathophysiology of PH including vascular oxidative stress, inflammation, and remodeling in PH; mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic changes in PH; ion channel and its alterations in the pathogenesis of PH as well as PH-associated right ventricular (RV) remodeling and dysfunctions. This review then summarizes metal general features and essentiality for the cardiovascular system and effects of metals on systemic blood pressure. Lastly, this review explores non-essential and essential metals and potential roles of their dyshomeostasis in PH and RV dysfunction. Although it remains early to conclude the role of metals in the pathogenesis of PH, emerging direct and indirect evidence implicates the possible contributions of metal-mediated toxicities in the development of PH. Future research should focus on comprehensive clinical metallomics study in PH patients; mechanistic evaluations to elucidate roles of various metals in PH animal models; and novel therapy clinical trials targeting metals.

37889739,When Everything Becomes Bigger: Big Data for Big Poultry Production.,"In future decades, the demand for poultry meat and eggs is predicted to considerably increase in pace with human population growth. Although this expansion clearly represents a remarkable opportunity for the sector, it conceals a multitude of challenges. Pollution and land erosion, competition for limited resources between animal and human nutrition, animal welfare concerns, limitations on the use of growth promoters and antimicrobial agents, and increasing risks and effects of animal infectious diseases and zoonoses are several topics that have received attention from authorities and the public. The increase in poultry production must be achieved mainly through optimization and increased efficiency. The increasing ability to generate large amounts of data (""big data"") is pervasive in both modern society and the farming industry. Information accessibility-coupled with the availability of tools and computational power to store, share, integrate, and analyze data with automatic and flexible algorithms-offers an unprecedented opportunity to develop tools to maximize farm profitability, reduce socio-environmental impacts, and increase animal and human health and welfare. A detailed description of all topics and applications of big data analysis in poultry farming would be infeasible. Therefore, the present work briefly reviews the application of sensor technologies, such as optical, acoustic, and wearable sensors, as well as infrared thermal imaging and optical flow, to poultry farming. The principles and benefits of advanced statistical techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning, and their use in developing effective and reliable classification and prediction models to benefit the farming system, are also discussed. Finally, recent progress in pathogen genome sequencing and analysis is discussed, highlighting practical applications in epidemiological tracking, and reconstruction of microorganisms' population dynamics, evolution, and spread. The benefits of the objective evaluation of the effectiveness of applied control strategies are also considered. Although human-artificial intelligence collaborations in the livestock sector can be frightening because they require farmers and employees in the sector to adapt to new roles, challenges, and competencies-and because several unknowns, limitations, and open-ended questions are inevitable-their overall benefits appear to be far greater than their drawbacks. As more farms and companies connect to technology, artificial intelligence (AI) and sensing technologies will begin to play a greater role in identifying patterns and solutions to pressing problems in modern animal farming, thus providing remarkable production-based and commercial advantages. Moreover, the combination of diverse sources and types of data will also become fundamental for the development of predictive models able to anticipate, rather than merely detect, disease occurrence. The increasing availability of sensors, infrastructures, and tools for big data collection, storage, sharing, and analysis-together with the use of open standards and integration with pathogen molecular epidemiology-have the potential to address the major challenge of producing higher-quality, more healthful food on a larger scale in a more sustainable manner, thereby protecting ecosystems, preserving natural resources, and improving animal and human welfare and health.",Franzo G; Legnardi M; Faustini G; Tucciarone CM; Cecchinato M,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37889739/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are the most prevalent PCLs. The existing modalities, including endoscopic ultrasound and cyst fluid analysis, only achieve accuracy rates of 65-75% in identifying carcinoma or high-grade dysplasia in IPMNs. Furthermore, surgical resection of PCLs reveals that up to half exhibit only low-grade dysplastic changes or benign neoplasms. To reduce unnecessary and high-risk pancreatic surgeries, more precise diagnostic techniques are necessary. A promising approach involves integrating existing data, such as clinical features, cyst morphology, and data from cyst fluid analysis, with confocal endomicroscopy and radiomics to enhance the prediction of advanced neoplasms in PCLs. Artificial intelligence and machine learning modalities can play a crucial role in achieving this goal. In this review, we explore current and future techniques to leverage these advanced technologies to improve diagnostic accuracy in the context of PCLs.",Jiang J; Chao WL; Cao T; Culp S; Napoléon B; El-Dika S; Machicado JD; Pannala R; Mok S; Luthra AK; Akshintala VS; Muniraj T; Krishna SG,"Biomimetics (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37887627/,1,0,0,0,0,0

37879461,Artificial intelligence-assisted digital pathology for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: current status and future directions.,"The worldwide prevalence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is increasing, causing a significant medical burden, but no approved therapeutics are currently available. NASH drug development requires histological analysis of liver biopsies by expert pathologists for trial enrolment and efficacy assessment, which can be hindered by multiple issues including sample heterogeneity, inter-reader and intra-reader variability, and ordinal scoring systems. Consequently, there is a high unmet need for accurate, reproducible, quantitative, and automated methods to assist pathologists with histological analysis to improve the precision around treatment and efficacy assessment. Digital pathology (DP) workflows in combination with artificial intelligence (AI) have been established in other areas of medicine and are being actively investigated in NASH to assist pathologists in the evaluation and scoring of NASH histology. DP/AI models can be used to automatically detect, localise, quantify, and score histological parameters and have the potential to reduce the impact of scoring variability in NASH clinical trials. This narrative review provides an overview of DP/AI tools in development for NASH, highlights key regulatory considerations, and discusses how these advances may impact the future of NASH clinical management and drug development. This should be a high priority in the NASH field, particularly to improve the development of safe and effective therapeutics.",Ratziu V; Hompesch M; Petitjean M; Serdjebi C; Iyer JS; Parwani AV; Tai D; Bugianesi E; Cusi K; Friedman SL; Lawitz E; Romero-Gómez M; Schuppan D; Loomba R; Paradis V; Behling C; Sanyal AJ,Journal of hepatology,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37879461/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37876229,Effect of SGLT2 Inhibitors on Discontinuation of Renin-angiotensin System Blockade: A Joint Analysis of the CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD Trials.,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are foundational therapy for CKD but are underused, in part because they are frequently withheld and not restarted due to hyperkalemia, AKI, or hospitalization. Consequently, ensuring persistent use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in CKD has long been a major clinical priority. In this joint analysis of the CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD trials, the relative risk of discontinuation of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was reduced by 15% in patients randomized to sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. This effect was more pronounced in patients with urine albumin:creatinine ratio ≥1000 mg/g, for whom the absolute benefits of these medications are the greatest. These findings indicate that SGLT2 inhibitors may enable better use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients with CKD. Strategies to enable persistent use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade to improve outcomes in CKD have long been sought. The effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on discontinuation of RAS blockade has yet to be evaluated. We conducted a joint analysis of canagliflozin and renal events in diabetes with established nephropathy clinical evaluation (CREDENCE) and dapagliflozin and prevention of adverse outcomes in CKD (DAPA-CKD), two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with albuminuric CKD. The main outcome was time to incident temporary or permanent discontinuation of RAS blockade, defined as interruption of an ACE inhibitor or ARB for at least 4 weeks or complete cessation during the double-blind on-treatment period. Cox regression analyses were used to estimate the treatment effects from each trial. Hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled with fixed effects meta-analysis to obtain summary treatment effects, overall and across key subgroups. During median follow-up of 2.2 years across both trials, 740 of 8483 (8.7%) patients discontinued RAS blockade. The relative risk for discontinuation of RAS blockade was 15% lower in patients randomized to receiving SGLT2 inhibitors (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.99), with consistent effects across trials ( P -heterogeneity = 0.92). The relative effect on RAS blockade discontinuation was more pronounced among patients with baseline urinary albumin:creatinine ratio ≥1000 mg/g (pooled HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.94; P -heterogeneity = 0.009). In patients with albuminuric CKD with and without type 2 diabetes, SGLT2 inhibitors facilitate the use of RAS blockade. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02065791 and NCT03036150 .

37860248,<i>Opuntia ficus-indica</i> (L.) Mill. - anticancer properties and phytochemicals: current trends and future perspectives.,"Cancer is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and conventional cancer therapies such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy often result in undesirable and adverse effects. Natural products have emerged as a promising alternative for cancer treatment, with comparatively fewer side effects reported. <i>Opuntia ficus-indica</i> (L.) Mill., a member of the <i>Cactaceae</i> family, contains a diverse array of phytochemicals, including flavonoids, polyphenols, betalains, and tannins, which have been shown to exhibit potent anticancer properties. Various parts of the Opuntia plant, including the fruits, stems/cladodes, and roots, have demonstrated cytotoxic effects against malignant cell lines in numerous studies. This review comprehensively summarizes the anticancer attributes of the phytochemicals found in <i>Opuntia ficus-indica</i> (L.) Mill., highlighting their potential as natural cancer prevention and treatment agents. Bibliometric metric analysis of PubMed and Scopus-retrieved data using VOSviewer as well as QDA analysis provide further insights and niche to be explored. Most anticancer studies on <i>Opuntia ficus-indica</i> and its purified metabolites are related to colorectal/colon cancer, followed by melanoma and breast cancer. Very little attention has been paid to leukemia, thyroid, endometrial, liver, and prostate cancer, and it could be considered an opportunity for researchers to explore <i>O. ficus-indica</i> and its metabolites against these cancers. The most notable mechanisms expressed and validated in those studies are apoptosis, cell cycle arrest (G0/G1 and G2/M), Bcl-2 modulation, antiproliferative, oxidative stress-mediated mechanisms, and cytochrome c. We have also observed that cladodes and fruits of <i>O. ficus-indica</i> have been more studied than other plant parts, which again opens the opportunity for the researchers to explore. Further, cell line-based studies dominated, and very few studies were related to animal-based experiments. The Zebrafish model is another platform to explore. However, it seems like more in-depth studies are required to ascertain clinical utility of this biosustainable resource <i>O. ficus-indica</i>.",Wang J; Rani N; Jakhar S; Redhu R; Kumar S; Kumar S; Kumar S; Devi B; Simal-Gandara J; Shen B; Singla RK,Frontiers in plant science,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37860248/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The investigation of these diseases was, until recently, limited to traditional in vitro and in vivo biological experimentation, but a clear switch to in silico methodologies is now under way. This review tries to provide a comprehensive assessment of state-of-the-art knowledge on omes, omics and multi-omics in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The notion and importance of omes, omics and multi-omics in both health and complex diseases like IBD is introduced, followed by a discussion of the various omics believed to be relevant to IBD pathogenesis, and how multi-omics ""big data"" can generate new insights translatable into useful clinical tools in IBD such as biomarker identification, prediction of remission and relapse, response to therapy, and precision medicine. The pitfalls and limitations of current IBD multi-omics studies are critically analyzed, revealing that, regardless of the types of omes being analyzed, the majority of current reports are still based on simple associations of descriptive retrospective data from cross-sectional patient cohorts rather than more powerful longitudinally collected prospective datasets. Given this limitation, some suggestions are provided on how IBD multi-omics data may be optimized for greater clinical and therapeutic benefit.

Motivated to mimic human senses, scientists developed electronic devices such as e-noses, e-tongues, and e-eyes, to spot signals relative to different chemical substances prevalent in food systems. To interpret the information provided by the sensors' responses, multiple chemometric approaches are used depending on the aim of the study. This review based on the Web of Science database, endeavored to scrutinize three e-sensing systems coupled to chemometric approaches for food quality evaluation. A total of 122 eligible articles pertaining to the e-nose, e-tongue and e-eye devices were selected to conduct this review. Most of the performed studies used exploratory analysis based on linear factorial methods, while classification and regression techniques came in the second position.

37798963,Combining Glucose Monitoring and Insulin Infusion in an Integrated Device: A Narrative Review of Challenges and Proposed Solutions.,"The introduction of automated insulin delivery (AID) systems has enabled increasing numbers of individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) to improve their glycemic control largely. However, use of AID systems is limited due to their complexity and costs associated. The user must wear both a continuously monitoring glucose system and an insulin infusion pump. The glucose sensor and the insulin catheter must be inserted at two different body sites using different insertion devices. In addition, the user must pair and manage the different systems. These communicate with the AID software implemented on the pump or on a third device such as a dedicated display device or smart phone application. These components might be developed and commercialized by different manufacturers, which in turn can cause difficulties for patients seeking technical support. A possible solution to these challenges would be to integrate the glucose sensor and insulin catheter into a single device. This would allow the glucose sensor and insulin catheter to be inserted simultaneously, eliminating the need for pairing, and simplifying system management. In recent years, different technologies have been developed and evaluated in clinical investigations that combine the glucose sensor and the insulin catheter in one platform. The consistent finding of all these studies is that integration has no adverse effect on insulin infusion and glucose measurements provided that certain conditions are met. In this review, we discuss the perceived challenges of such an approach and discuss possible solutions that have been proposed.",Schoemaker M; Martensson A; Mader JK; Nørgaard K; Freckmann G; Benhamou PY; Diem P; Heinemann L,Journal of diabetes science and technology,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37798963/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Two large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) recently discovered and cross-validated genome-wide significant (GWS) loci for suicide attempt (SA). The present study leveraged the genetic cohorts from both studies to conduct the largest GWAS meta-analysis of SA to date. Multi-ancestry and admixture-specific meta-analyses were conducted within groups of significant African, East Asian, and European ancestry admixtures. This study comprised 22 cohorts, including 43,871 SA cases and 915,025 ancestry-matched controls. Analytical methods across multi-ancestry and individual ancestry admixtures included inverse variance-weighted fixed-effects meta-analyses, followed by gene, gene-set, tissue-set, and drug-target enrichment, as well as summary-data-based Mendelian randomization with brain expression quantitative trait loci data, phenome-wide genetic correlation, and genetic causal proportion analyses. Multi-ancestry and European ancestry admixture GWAS meta-analyses identified 12 risk loci at p values <5×10<sup>-8</sup>. These loci were mostly intergenic and implicated <i>DRD2</i>, <i>SLC6A9</i>, <i>FURIN</i>, <i>NLGN1</i>, <i>SOX5</i>, <i>PDE4B</i>, and <i>CACNG2</i>. The multi-ancestry SNP-based heritability estimate of SA was 5.7% on the liability scale (SE=0.003, p=5.7×10<sup>-80</sup>). Significant brain tissue gene expression and drug set enrichment were observed. There was shared genetic variation of SA with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, smoking, and risk tolerance after conditioning SA on both major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. Genetic causal proportion analyses implicated shared genetic risk for specific health factors. This multi-ancestry analysis of suicide attempt identified several loci contributing to risk and establishes significant shared genetic covariation with clinical phenotypes. These findings provide insight into genetic factors associated with suicide attempt across ancestry admixture populations, in veteran and civilian populations, and in attempt versus death.",Docherty AR; Mullins N; Ashley-Koch AE; Qin X; Coleman JRI; Shabalin A; Kang J; Murnyak B; Wendt F; Adams M; Campos AI; DiBlasi E; Fullerton JM; Kranzler HR; Bakian AV; Monson ET; Rentería ME; Walss-Bass C; Andreassen OA; Behera C; Bulik CM; Edenberg HJ; Kessler RC; Mann JJ; Nurnberger JI; Pistis G; Streit F; Ursano RJ; Polimanti R; Dennis M; Garrett M; Hair L; Harvey P; Hauser ER; Hauser MA; Huffman J; Jacobson D; Madduri R; McMahon B; Oslin DW; Trafton J; Awasthi S; Berrettini WH; Bohus M; Chang X; Chen HC; Chen WJ; Christensen ED; Crow S; Duriez P; Edwards AC; Fernández-Aranda F; Galfalvy H; Gandal M; Gorwood P; Guo Y; Hafferty JD; Hakonarson H; Halmi KA; Hishimoto A; Jain S; Jamain S; Jiménez-Murcia S; Johnson C; Kaplan AS; Kaye WH; Keel PK; Kennedy JL; Kim M; Klump KL; Levey DF; Li D; Liao SC; Lieb K; Lilenfeld L; Marshall CR; Mitchell JE; Okazaki S; Otsuka I; Pinto D; Powers A; Ramoz N; Ripke S; Roepke S; Rozanov V; Scherer SW; Schmahl C; Sokolowski M; Starnawska A; Strober M; Su MH; Thornton LM; Treasure J; Ware EB; Watson HJ; Witt SH; Woodside DB; Yilmaz Z; Zillich L; Adolfsson R; Agartz I; Alda M; Alfredsson L; Appadurai V; Artigas MS; Van der Auwera S; Azevedo MH; Bass N; Bau CHD; Baune BT; Bellivier F; Berger K; Biernacka JM; Bigdeli TB; Binder EB; Boehnke M; Boks MP; Braff DL; Bryant R; Budde M; Byrne EM; Cahn W; Castelao E; Cervilla JA; Chaumette B; Corvin A; Craddock N; Djurovic S; Foo JC; Forstner AJ; Frye M; Gatt JM; Giegling I; Grabe HJ; Green MJ; Grevet EH; Grigoroiu-Serbanescu M; Gutierrez B; Guzman-Parra J; Hamshere ML; Hartmann AM; Hauser J; Heilmann-Heimbach S; Hoffmann P; Ising M; Jones I; Jones LA; Jonsson L; Kahn RS; Kelsoe JR; Kendler KS; Kloiber S; Koenen KC; Kogevinas M; Krebs MO; Landén M; Leboyer M; Lee PH; Levinson DF; Liao C; Lissowska J; Mayoral F; McElroy SL; McGrath P; McGuffin P; McQuillin A; Mehta D; Melle I; Mitchell PB; Molina E; Morken G; Nievergelt C; Nöthen MM; O'Donovan MC; Ophoff RA; Owen MJ; Pato C; Pato MT; Penninx BWJH; Potash JB; Power RA; Preisig M; Quested D; Ramos-Quiroga JA; Reif A; Ribasés M; Richarte V; Rietschel M; Rivera M; Roberts A; Roberts G; Rouleau GA; Rovaris DL; Sanders AR; Schofield PR; Schulze TG; Scott LJ; Serretti A; Shi J; Sirignano L; Sklar P; Smeland OB; Smoller JW; Sonuga-Barke EJS; Trzaskowski M; Tsuang MT; Turecki G; Vilar-Ribó L; Vincent JB; Völzke H; Walters JTR; Weickert CS; Weickert TW; Weissman MM; Williams LM; Wray NR; Zai CC; Agerbo E; Børglum AD; Breen G; Demontis D; Erlangsen A; Gelernter J; Glatt SJ; Hougaard DM; Hwu HG; Kuo PH; Lewis CM; Li QS; Liu CM; Martin NG; McIntosh AM; Medland SE; Mors O; Nordentoft M; Olsen CM; Porteous D; Smith DJ; Stahl EA; Stein MB; Wasserman D; Werge T; Whiteman DC; Willour V; Coon H; Beckham JC; Kimbrel NA; Ruderfer DM,The American journal of psychiatry,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37777856/,0,0,0,1,0,0
37774669,Targeting fatty acid uptake and metabolism in cancer cells: A promising strategy for cancer treatment.,"Despite scientific development, cancer is still a fatal disease. The development of cancer is thought to be significantly influenced by fatty acids. Several mechanisms that control fatty acid absorption and metabolism are reported to be altered in cancer cells to support their survival. Cancer cells can use de novo synthesis or uptake of extracellular fatty acid if one method is restricted. This factor makes it more difficult to target one pathway while failing to treat the disease properly. Side effects may also arise if several inhibitors simultaneously target many targets. If a viable inhibitor could work on several routes, the number of negative effects might be reduced. Comparative investigations against cell viability have found several potent natural and manmade substances.

37767686,Food Is Medicine: A Presidential Advisory From the American Heart Association.,"Unhealthy diets are a major impediment to achieving a healthier population in the United States. Although there is a relatively clear sense of what constitutes a healthy diet, most of the US population does not eat healthy food at rates consistent with the recommended clinical guidelines. An abundance of barriers, including food and nutrition insecurity, how food is marketed and advertised, access to and affordability of healthy foods, and behavioral challenges such as a focus on immediate versus delayed gratification, stand in the way of healthier dietary patterns for many Americans. Food Is Medicine may be defined as the provision of healthy food resources to prevent, manage, or treat specific clinical conditions in coordination with the health care sector. Although the field has promise, relatively few studies have been conducted with designs that provide strong evidence of associations between Food Is Medicine interventions and health outcomes or health costs. Much work needs to be done to create a stronger body of evidence that convincingly demonstrates the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different types of Food Is Medicine interventions. An estimated 90% of the $4.3 trillion annual cost of health care in the United States is spent on medical care for chronic disease. For many of these diseases, diet is a major risk factor, so even modest improvements in diet could have a significant impact. This presidential advisory offers an overview of the state of the field of Food Is Medicine and a road map for a new research initiative that strategically approaches the outstanding questions in the field while prioritizing a human-centered design approach to achieve high rates of patient engagement and sustained behavior change. This will ideally happen in the context of broader efforts to use a health equity-centered approach to enhance the ways in which our food system and related policies support improvements in health.",Volpp KG; Berkowitz SA; Sharma SV; Anderson CAM; Brewer LC; Elkind MSV; Gardner CD; Gervis JE; Harrington RA; Herrero M; Lichtenstein AH; McClellan M; Muse J; Roberto CA; Zachariah JPV,Circulation,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37767686/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37765812,Technology to Automatically Record Eating Behavior in Real Life: A Systematic Review.,"To monitor adherence to diets and to design and evaluate nutritional interventions, it is essential to obtain objective knowledge about eating behavior. In most research, measures of eating behavior are based on self-reporting, such as 24-h recalls, food records (food diaries) and food frequency questionnaires. Self-reporting is prone to inaccuracies due to inaccurate and subjective recall and other biases. Recording behavior using nonobtrusive technology in daily life would overcome this. Here, we provide an up-to-date systematic overview encompassing all (close-to) publicly or commercially available technologies to automatically record eating behavior in real-life settings. A total of 1328 studies were screened and, after applying defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 122 studies were included for in-depth evaluation. Technologies in these studies were categorized by what type of eating behavior they measure and which type of sensor technology they use. In general, we found that relatively simple sensors are often used. Depending on the purpose, these are mainly motion sensors, microphones, weight sensors and photo cameras. While several of these technologies are commercially available, there is still a lack of publicly available algorithms that are needed to process and interpret the resulting data. We argue that future work should focus on developing robust algorithms and validating these technologies in real-life settings. Combining technologies (e.g., prompting individuals for self-reports at sensed, opportune moments) is a promising route toward ecologically valid studies of eating behavior.",Hiraguchi H; Perone P; Toet A; Camps G; Brouwer AM,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37765812/,0,1,0,0,0,0
37764724,Expert Consensus on the Long-Term Effectiveness of Medical Nutrition Therapy and Its Impact on the Outcomes of Adults with Phenylketonuria.,"Many adults with phenylketonuria (PKU) rely on medical nutrition therapy (MNT; low phenylalanine (Phe) diet with protein substitutes/medical foods) to maintain blood Phe concentrations within recommended ranges and prevent PKU-associated comorbidities. Despite disease detection through newborn screening and introduction of MNT as early as birth, adherence to MNT often deteriorates from childhood onwards, complicating the assessment of its effectiveness in the long term. Via a modified Delphi process, consensus (≥70% agreement) was sought on 19 statements among an international, multidisciplinary 13-member expert panel. After three iterative voting rounds, the panel achieved consensus on 17 statements related to the limitations of the long-term effectiveness of MNT (7), the burden of long-term reliance on MNT (4), and its potential long-term detrimental health effects (6). According to the expert panel, the effectiveness of MNT is limited in the long term, is associated with a high treatment burden, and demonstrates that adults with PKU are often unable to achieve metabolic control through dietary management alone, creating an unmet need in the adult PKU population.",Rocha JC; Ahring KK; Bausell H; Bilder DA; Harding CO; Inwood A; Longo N; Muntau AC; Pessoa ALS; Rohr F; Sivri S; Hermida Á,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37764724/,0,0,0,0,0,0

37739704,Artificial intelligence & clinical nutrition: What the future might have in store.,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly emerging technology in healthcare that has the potential to revolutionise clinical nutrition. AI can assist in analysing complex data, interpreting medical images, and providing personalised nutrition interventions for patients. Clinical nutrition is a critical aspect of patient care, and AI can help clinicians make more informed decisions regarding patients' nutritional requirements, disease prevention, and management. AI algorithms can analyse large datasets to identify novel associations between diet and disease outcomes, enabling clinicians to make evidence-based nutritional recommendations. AI-powered devices and applications can also assist in tracking dietary intake, providing feedback, and motivating patients towards healthier food choices. However, the adoption of AI in clinical nutrition raises several ethical and regulatory concerns, such as data privacy and bias. Further research is needed to assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of AI-powered nutrition interventions. In conclusion, AI has the potential to transform clinical nutrition, but its integration into clinical practice should be carefully monitored to ensure patient safety and benefit.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning approaches have been developed to detect novel biomarkers and interactions in complex data sets. We discuss exemplar uses and evaluate current applications and limitations of AI to discover novel biomarkers. Remaining challenges include a lack of diversity in the data sets available, the sheer complexity of investigating interactions, the invasiveness and cost of some biomarkers, and poor reporting in some studies. Overcoming these challenges will involve collecting data from underrepresented populations, developing more powerful AI approaches, validating the use of noninvasive biomarkers, and adhering to reporting guidelines. By harnessing rich multimodal data through AI approaches and international collaborative innovation, we are well positioned to identify clinically useful biomarkers that are accurate, generalizable, unbiased, and acceptable in clinical practice. HIGHLIGHTS: Artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches may accelerate dementia biomarker discovery. Remaining challenges include data set suitability due to size and bias in cohort selection.

In this review, we describe how the physician can utilize the growing healthcare databases to develop deep learning and machine learning algorithms, thus helping to improve screening, assessment, prediction of clinical events and outcomes related to clinical nutrition. Artificial intelligence can be applied to all the fields of clinical nutrition. Improving screening tools, identifying malnourished cancer patients or obesity using large databases has been achieved. In intensive care, machine learning has been able to predict enteral feeding intolerance, diarrhea, or refeeding hypophosphatemia. The outcome of patients with cancer can also be improved. Microbiota and metabolomics profiles are better integrated with the clinical condition using machine learning. However, ethical considerations and limitations of the use of artificial intelligence should be considered. Artificial intelligence is here to support the decision-making process of health professionals.

37647625,Development of the Canadian Eating Practices Screener to assess eating practices based on 2019 Canada's Food Guide recommendations.,"In 2019, Health Canada released a new iteration of Canada's Food Guide (2019-CFG), which, for the first time, highlighted recommendations regarding eating practices, i.e., guidance on where, when, why, and how to eat. The objective of this study was to develop a brief self-administered screener to assess eating practices recommended in the 2019-CFG among adults aged 18-65 years. Development of the screener items was informed by a review of existing tools and mapping of items onto 2019-CFG recommendations. Face and content validity were assessed with experts in public health nutrition and/or dietary assessment (<i>n</i> = 16) and individuals from Government of Canada (<i>n</i> = 14). Cognitive interviews were conducted with English-speaking (<i>n</i> = 16) and French-speaking (<i>n</i> = 16) adults living in Canada to assess face validity and understanding of the screener items. While some modifications were identified to improve relevance or clarity, overall, the screener items were found to be relevant, well-constructed, and clearly worded. This comprehensive process resulted in the Canadian Eating Practices Screener/Questionnaire court canadien sur les pratiques alimentaires, which includes 21 items that assess eating practices recommended in the 2019-CFG. This screener can facilitate monitoring and surveillance efforts of the 2019-CFG eating practices as well as research exploring how these practices are associated with various health outcomes.",Wallace A; Martin A; Bédard A; Pitre C; Lemieux S; Simpson JR; Kirkpatrick SI; Hutchinson JM; Williams TE; Westaway AM; Lamarche B; Day M; Guenther PM; Jessri M; L'Abbé MR; Louzada MLC; Olstad DL; Prowse R; Reedy J; Vatanparast H; Vena JE; Haines J,"Applied physiology, nutrition, and metabolism = Physiologie appliquee, nutrition et metabolisme",2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37647625/,1,0,0,0,0,0

37639369,Artificial intelligence for dementia research methods optimization.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches are increasingly being used in dementia research. However, several methodological challenges exist that may limit the insights we can obtain from high-dimensional data and our ability to translate these findings into improved patient outcomes. To improve reproducibility and replicability, researchers should make their well-documented code and modeling pipelines openly available. Data should also be shared where appropriate. To enhance the acceptability of models and AI-enabled systems to users, researchers should prioritize interpretable methods that provide insights into how decisions are generated. Models should be developed using multiple, diverse datasets to improve robustness, generalizability, and reduce potentially harmful bias. To improve clarity and reproducibility, researchers should adhere to reporting guidelines that are co-produced with multiple stakeholders. If these methodological challenges are overcome, AI and ML hold enormous promise for changing the landscape of dementia research and care. HIGHLIGHTS: Machine learning (ML) can improve diagnosis, prevention, and management of dementia. Inadequate reporting of ML procedures affects reproduction/replication of results. ML models built on unrepresentative datasets do not generalize to new datasets. Obligatory metrics for certain model structures and use cases have not been defined.

Our paper aimed to review the latest technologies used in T1DM management for better glycemic control and their impact on daily life for people with diabetes. Continuous glucose monitoring systems provide a better understanding of daily glycemic variations for children and adults and can be easily used. These systems diminish diabetes distress and improve diabetes control by decreasing hypoglycemia. Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusions have proven their benefits in selected patients. There is a tendency to use more complex systems, such as hybrid closed-loop systems that can modulate insulin infusion based on glycemic readings and artificial intelligence-based algorithms. It can help people manage the burdens associated with T1DM management, such as fear of hypoglycemia, exercising, and long-term complications. The future is promising and aims to develop more complex ways of automated control of glycemic levels to diminish the distress of individuals living with diabetes.",Elian V; Popovici V; Ozon EA; Musuc AM; Fița AC; Rusu E; Radulian G; Lupuliasa D,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37629520/,1,0,0,0,0,0

This study quantifies the relative contribution of indoor residential dust phthalate and phthalate alternative concentrations to total internal dose estimated from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) urinary metabolite concentrations. Specifically, median phthalate and phthalate alternative concentrations measured in residential dust were determined by updating a pre-existing systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2015 and the attributable internal dose was estimated using intake and reverse dosimetry models. Employing a predetermined search strategy, 12 studies published between January 2000 and April 2022 from Web of Science and PubMed measuring phthalates and phthalate alternatives in residential dust were identified. From the data extracted, it was estimated that dust contributed more significantly to the internal dose of low-molecular weight chemicals such as DEP and BBP when compared to high-molecular weight chemicals such as DEHTP. Additionally, findings showed that the chemical profile of residential dust is changing temporally with more phthalate alternatives being detected in the indoor environment. Future studies should seek to characterize the contribution of dust to an overall phthalate and phthalate alternative intake for individuals who have higher than normal exposures.",Milton SG; Tejiram RA; Joglekar R; Hoffman K,International journal of environmental research and public health,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37623174/,0,1,0,1,0,0
37621737,Rapid review of factors influencing dietary behaviors in Fiji.,"In Fiji, multiple burdens of malnutrition including undernutrition, overweight/obesity, and micronutrient deficiencies coexist at the individual, household, and population levels. The diets of children, adolescents, and adults are generally unhealthy. The objective of this review was to understand how the dietary behaviors of children, adolescents, and women in Fiji are influenced by individual, social, and food environment factors. This rapid review was conducted to synthesize existing evidence, identify research gaps in the evidence base, and make recommendations for future research. The Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods and the updated guideline for reporting systematic reviews were used. The search strategy for this rapid review was based on the Population Context Outcome [P(E)CO] framework, including search terms for population (children, adolescents, and adults), context (Fiji), and outcome (dietary behaviors). Searches were conducted in PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar. The 22 studies included in this review identified different factors influencing dietary behaviors in Fiji. Individual preferences for processed and imported foods, especially of younger generations, and social dynamics, especially gender norms and social pressure, to serve meat and overeat appeared to be prominent in driving dietary habits. The ongoing nutrition transition has led to increasing availability and affordability of ultra-processed and fast foods, especially in urban areas. Concerns about food safety and contamination and climate change and its effect on local food production also appear to influence dietary choices. This review identified different dynamics influencing dietary behaviors, but also research gaps especially with regard to the food environment, calling for an integrated approach to address these factors more systemically.",Boxer B; Trübswasser U; Lesi V; Naika A; Dahal P; Sagan S; Joshi K; Irache A; Singh P; Nand D; Kama A; Deo A; Goudet S,Frontiers in nutrition,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37621737/,1,0,0,0,0,0

This study reviewed the evidence on the usability and preference of self-injection devices of SB4 and SB5 compared with the reference product injectors. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed using the search string ""(Imraldi OR Hadlima OR SB5 OR Benepali OR Brenzys OR SB4) AND (preference) AND (device)"" covering the period from 28 January 2016 (first introduction of SB4) to 31 May 2022. Only articles and abstracts on usability or preference-rating of SB4 and SB5 autoinjectors (AI) written in English were selected. Additional papers identified via manual search supplemented the retrieved papers. A total of nine articles and one conference poster were selected (seven surveys, one observational study, and two phase II studies). Overall, participants of the studies included nurses and rheumatologists, as well as patients who were from three medical specialties where these medicines are most commonly used (rheumatology, gastroenterology, and dermatology). The majority of patients and healthcare professionals rated ease of use and ease of grip as the most important device attributes. SB4/Pen and SB5/Pen were mostly preferred over their prefilled syringes (PFS), Enbrel/Pen, and Humira/Pen. The analyzed data on usability and device preference indicate that SB4/Pen and SB5/Pen were preferred over the other reference product autoinjectors, thanks to their button-free design, auditory and visual injection feedback, and overall ease of use. Therefore, they were preferred over the other reference product autoinjectors.

37615786,Mechanosensing and Mechanosignal Transduction in Atherosclerosis.,"This review aims to summarize the latest findings on mechanosensing in atherosclerosis, elucidating the molecular mechanisms, cellular players, and potential therapeutic targets. Atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the buildup of lipid-laden plaque within arterial walls, is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease-related mortality and morbidity. Interestingly, atherosclerosis predominantly occurs in arterial areas with curves and branches. In these regions, endothelial cells encounter irregular blood flow with distinctive low-intensity fluctuating shear stress. On the other hand, straight sections of arteries, subjected to a consistent flow and related high-intensity, one-way shear stress, are relatively safeguarded against atherosclerosis due to shear-dependent, disease-preventing endothelial cell reactions. In recent years, researchers have been investigating the role of mechanosensing in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. At the core of mechanosensing is the ability of various cells to sense and respond to biomechanical forces in their environment. In the context of atherosclerosis, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and immune cells are subjected to various mechanical or physical stimuli, including shear stress, cyclic strain, and matrix stiffness. These mechanical cues play a crucial role in regulating cellular behavior and contribute to the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. Accumulating evidence suggests that various mechanical or physical cues play a critical role in the development and promotion of atherosclerosis.",Rahaman SG; Mahanty M; Mukherjee P; Dutta B; Rahaman SO,Current atherosclerosis reports,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37615786/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37606202,Effect of mitochondrial quantity and quality controls in white adipose tissue on healthy lifespan: Essential roles of GH/IGF-1-independent pathways in caloric restriction-mediated metabolic remodeling.,"Long-term caloric restriction is a conventional and reproducible dietary intervention to improve whole body metabolism, suppress age-related pathophysiology, and extend lifespan. The beneficial actions of caloric restriction are widely accepted to be regulated in both growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor 1-dependent and -independent manners. Although growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor 1-dependent regulatory mechanisms are well described, those occurring independent of growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor 1 are poorly understood. In this review, we focus on molecular mechanisms of caloric restriction regulated in a growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor 1-independent manner. Caloric restriction increases mitochondrial quantity and improves mitochondrial quality by activating an axis involving sterol regulatory element binding protein-c/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α/mitochondrial intermediate peptidase in a growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor 1-independent manner, particularly in white adipose tissue. Fibroblast growth factor 21 is also involved in this axis. Moreover, the axis may be regulated by lower leptin signaling. Thus, caloric restriction appears to induce beneficial actions partially by regulating mitochondrial quantity and quality in white adipose tissue in a growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor 1-independent manner.",Otani Y; Nozaki Y; Mizunoe Y; Kobayashi M; Higami Y,Pathology international,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37606202/,1,0,0,0,0,0

37585700,Novel and efficient techniques in the discovery of antioxidant peptides.,"As a research hotspot in food science and nutrition, antioxidant peptides can function by scavenging free radicals, inhibiting peroxides, and chelating metal ions. Therefore, how to efficiently discover and screen antioxidant peptides has become a key issue in research and production. Traditional discovery methods are time-consuming and costly, but also challenging to resolve the quantitative structure-activity relationship of antioxidant peptides. Several novel techniques, including artificial intelligence, molecular docking, bioinformatics, quantum chemistry, phage display, switchSENSE, surface plasmon resonance, and fluorescence polarization, are emerging rapidly as solutions. These techniques possess efficient capability for the discovery of antioxidant peptides, even with the potential for high-throughput screening. In addition, the quantitative structure-activity relationship can be resolved.

37582096,Fructose-containing food sources and blood pressure: A systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled feeding trials.,"Whether food source or energy mediates the effect of fructose-containing sugars on blood pressure (BP) is unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of different food sources of fructose-containing sugars at different levels of energy control on BP. We searched MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library through June 2021 for controlled trials ≥7-days. We prespecified 4 trial designs: substitution (energy matched substitution of sugars); addition (excess energy from sugars added); subtraction (excess energy from sugars subtracted); and ad libitum (energy from sugars freely replaced). Outcomes were systolic and diastolic BP. Independent reviewers extracted data. GRADE assessed the certainty of evidence. We included 93 reports (147 trial comparisons, N = 5,213) assessing 12 different food sources across 4 energy control levels in adults with and without hypertension or at risk for hypertension. Total fructose-containing sugars had no effect in substitution, subtraction, or ad libitum trials but decreased systolic and diastolic BP in addition trials (P<0.05). There was evidence of interaction/influence by food source: fruit and 100% fruit juice decreased and mixed sources (with sugar-sweetened beverages [SSBs]) increased BP in addition trials and the removal of SSBs (linear dose response gradient) and mixed sources (with SSBs) decreased BP in subtraction trials. The certainty of evidence was generally moderate. Food source and energy control appear to mediate the effect of fructose-containing sugars on BP. The evidence provides a good indication that fruit and 100% fruit juice at low doses (up to or less than the public health threshold of ~10% E) lead to small, but important reductions in BP, while the addition of excess energy of mixed sources (with SSBs) at high doses (up to 23%) leads to moderate increases and their removal or the removal of SSBs alone (up to ~20% E) leads to small, but important decreases in BP in adults with and without hypertension or at risk for hypertension.

37572481,Effect of polysaccharide addition on food physical properties: A review.,"The texture, flavor, performance and nutrition of foods are affected by their physical properties during processing, cooking, storage, and shelf life. In addition to chemical, physical, and enzymatic modification methods, polysaccharide addition is also considered a safe, effective, and convenient food modification strategy. However, thus far, literature review on the effects of polysaccharides on the physical properties of foods is few. Therefore, the present work reviews the effects of polysaccharides on water retention capacity, rheological property, suspension ability, viscoelasticity, emulsifying property, gelling property, stability, and starch regeneration and digestion. Furthermore, the existing problems and future recommendations during food physical property modification by polysaccharides are presented. This work aims to provide some theoretical references for future research, development, and application of polysaccharides on food physical property modification.",Wang Z; Wang L; Yu X; Wang X; Zheng Y; Hu X; Zhang P; Sun Q; Wang Q; Li N,Food chemistry,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37572481/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37545571,Bioactive compounds for human and planetary health.,"Bioactive compounds found in edible plants and foods are vital for human and planetary health, yet their significance remains underappreciated. These natural bioactives, as part of whole diets, ingredients, or supplements, can modulate multiple aspects of human health and wellness. Recent advancements in omic sciences and computational biology, combined with the development of Precision Nutrition, have contributed to the convergence of nutrition and medicine, as well as more efficient and affordable healthcare solutions that harness the power of food for prevention and therapy. Innovation in this field is crucial to feed a growing global population sustainably and healthily. This requires significant changes in our food system, spanning agriculture, production, distribution and consumption. As we are facing pressing planetary health challenges, investing in bioactive-based solutions is an opportunity to protect biodiversity and the health of our soils, waters, and the atmosphere, while also creating value for consumers, patients, communities, and stakeholders. Such research and innovation targets include alternative proteins, such as cellular agriculture and plant-derived protein; natural extracts that improve shelf-life as natural preservatives; upcycling of agricultural by-products to reduce food waste; and the development of natural alternatives to synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. Translational research and innovation in the field of natural bioactives are currently being developed at two levels, using a systems-oriented approach. First, at the biological level, the interplay between these compounds and the human host and microbiome is being elucidated through omics research, big data and artificial intelligence, to accelerate both discovery and validation. Second, at the ecosystem level, efforts are focused on producing diverse nutrient-rich, flavorful, and resilient, yet high-yield agricultural crops, and educating consumers to make informed choices that benefit both their health and the planet. Adopting a system-oriented perspective helps: unravel the intricate and dynamic relationships between bioactives, nutrition, and sustainability outcomes, harnessing the power of nature to promote human health and wellbeing; foster sustainable agriculture and protect the ecosystem. Interdisciplinary collaboration in this field is needed for a new era of research and development of practical food-based solutions for some of the most pressing challenges humanity and our planet are facing today.",Kussmann M; Abe Cunha DH; Berciano S,Frontiers in nutrition,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37545571/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37539732,Exploring the human microbiome - A step forward for precision medicine in breast cancer.,"The second most frequent cancer in the world and the most common malignancy in women is breast cancer. Breast cancer is a significant health concern in India with a high mortality-to-incidence ratio and presentation at a younger age. Recent studies have identified gut microbiota as a significant factor that can have an influence on the development, treatment, and prognosis of breast cancer. This review article aims to describe the influence of microbial dysbiosis on breast cancer occurrence and the possible interactions between oncobiome and specific breast cancer molecular subtypes. The review further also discusses the role of epigenetics and diet/nutrition in the regulation of the gut and breast microbiome and its association with breast cancer prevention, therapy, and recurrence. Additionally, the recent technological advances in microbiome research, including next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, genome sequencing, single-cell sequencing, and microbial metabolomics along with recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have also been reviewed. This is an attempt to present a comprehensive status of the microbiome as a key cancer biomarker. We believe that correlating microbiome and carcinogenesis is important as it can provide insights into the mechanisms by which microbial dysbiosis can influence cancer development and progression, leading to the potential use of the microbiome as a tool for prognostication and personalized therapy.",Jotshi A; Sukla KK; Haque MM; Bose C; Varma B; Koppiker CB; Joshi S; Mishra R,"Cancer reports (Hoboken, N.J.)",2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37539732/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The Cox hazards model was used to evaluate statin use on primary ischemic stroke. Case group: T2DM patients who received statins; control group: T2DM patients who received no statins during the follow-up. Adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for primary ischemic stroke was 0.45 (95% CI: 0.44 to 0.46). Cox regression analysis showed significant reductions in primary ischemic stroke incidence in users of different statin classes. Corresponding aHRs (95% CI) were 0.09 to 0.79 for pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, fluvastatin, and lovastatin. Multivariate analyses indicated significant reductions in primary ischemic stroke incidence for patients who received different cumulative defined daily doses (cDDDs) per year (cDDD-year). Corresponding aHRs (95% CI) were 0.17 to 0.77 for quartiles 4 to 1 of cDDD-years, respectively (P for trend < .0001). Optimal intensity daily dose of statin use was 0.89 DDD with the lowest aHR of primary ischemic stroke compared with other DDDs. Persistent statin use reduces the risk of primary ischemic stroke in T2DM patients. Higher cDDD-year values are associated with higher reductions in primary ischemic stroke risk in T2DM patients.",Yu JM; Chen WM; Shia BC; Wu SY,Current atherosclerosis reports,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37515725/,1,0,0,0,0,1
37513022,The Role of Gut Dysbiosis in the Loss of Intestinal Immune Cell Functions and Viral Pathogenesis.,"The gut microbiome plays a critical role in maintaining overall health and immune function. However, dysbiosis, an imbalance in microbiome composition, can have profound effects on various aspects of human health, including susceptibility to viral infections. Despite numerous studies investigating the influence of viral infections on gut microbiome, the impact of gut dysbiosis on viral infection and pathogenesis remains relatively understudied. The clinical variability observed in SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal influenza infections, and the presence of natural HIV suppressors, suggests that host-intrinsic factors, including the gut microbiome, may contribute to viral pathogenesis. The gut microbiome has been shown to influence the host immune system by regulating intestinal homeostasis through interactions with immune cells. This review aims to enhance our understanding of how viral infections perturb the gut microbiome and mucosal immune cells, affecting host susceptibility and response to viral infections. Specifically, we focus on exploring the interactions between gamma delta (γδ) T cells and gut microbes in the context of inflammatory viral pathogenesis and examine studies highlighting the role of the gut microbiome in viral disease outcomes. Furthermore, we discuss emerging evidence and potential future directions for microbiome modulation therapy in the context of viral pathogenesis.",Fakharian F; Thirugnanam S; Welsh DA; Kim WK; Rappaport J; Bittinger K; Rout N,Microorganisms,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37513022/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37475596,Utilising the precision nutrition toolkit in the path towards precision medicine.,"The overall aim of precision nutrition is to replace the 'one size fits all' approach to dietary advice with recommendations that are more specific to the individual in order to improve the prevention or management of chronic disease. Interest in precision nutrition has grown with advancements in technologies such as genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and measurement of the gut microbiome. Precision nutrition initiatives have three major applications in precision medicine. First, they aim to provide more 'precision' dietary assessments through artificial intelligence, wearable devices or by employing omic technologies to characterise diet more precisely. Secondly, precision nutrition allows us to understand the underlying mechanisms of how diet influences disease risk and identify individuals who are more susceptible to disease due to gene-diet or microbiota-diet interactions. Third, precision nutrition can be used for 'personalised nutrition' advice where machine-learning algorithms can integrate data from omic profiles with other personal and clinical measures to improve disease risk. Proteomics and metabolomics especially provide the ability to discover new biomarkers of food or nutrient intake, proteomic or metabolomic signatures of diet and disease, and discover potential mechanisms of diet-disease interactions. Although there are several challenges that must be overcome to improve the reproducibility, cost-effectiveness and efficacy of these approaches, precision nutrition methodologies have great potential for nutrition research and clinical application.",Sawicki C; Haslam D; Bhupathiraju S,The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37475596/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37459304,Combined genome-wide association study of 136 quantitative ear morphology traits in multiple populations reveal 8 novel loci.,"Human ear morphology, a complex anatomical structure represented by a multidimensional set of correlated and heritable phenotypes, has a poorly understood genetic architecture. In this study, we quantitatively assessed 136 ear morphology traits using deep learning analysis of digital face images in 14,921 individuals from five different cohorts in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Through GWAS meta-analysis and C-GWASs, a recently introduced method to effectively combine GWASs of many traits, we identified 16 genetic loci involved in various ear phenotypes, eight of which have not been previously associated with human ear features. Our findings suggest that ear morphology shares genetic determinants with other surface ectoderm-derived traits such as facial variation, mono eyebrow, and male pattern baldness. Our results enhance the genetic understanding of human ear morphology and shed light on the shared genetic contributors of different surface ectoderm-derived phenotypes. Additionally, gene editing experiments in mice have demonstrated that knocking out the newly ear-associated gene (Intu) and a previously ear-associated gene (Tbx15) causes deviating mouse ear morphology.",Li Y; Xiong Z; Zhang M; Hysi PG; Qian Y; Adhikari K; Weng J; Wu S; Du S; Gonzalez-Jose R; Schuler-Faccini L; Bortolini MC; Acuna-Alonzo V; Canizales-Quinteros S; Gallo C; Poletti G; Bedoya G; Rothhammer F; Wang J; Tan J; Yuan Z; Jin L; Uitterlinden AG; Ghanbari M; Ikram MA; Nijsten T; Zhu X; Lei Z; Jia P; Ruiz-Linares A; Spector TD; Wang S; Kayser M; Liu F,PLoS genetics,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37459304/,0,0,0,1,0,0
37449109,Quorum sensing interference by phenolic compounds - A matter of bacterial misunderstanding.,"Over the past decade, numerous publications have emerged in the literature focusing on the inhibition of quorum sensing (QS) by plant extracts and phenolic compounds. However, there is still a scarcity of studies that delve into the specific mechanisms by which these compounds inhibit QS. Thus, our question is whether phenolic compounds can inhibit QS in a specific or indirect manner and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved. This study is focused on the most studied QS system, namely, autoinducer type 1 (AI-1), represented by <i>N</i>-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) signals and the AHL-mediated QS responses. Here, we analyzed the recent literature in order to understand how phenolic compounds act at the cellular level, at sub-inhibitory concentrations, and evaluated by which QS inhibition mechanisms they may act. The biotechnological application of QS inhibitors holds promising prospects for the pharmaceutical and food industries, serving as adjunct therapies and in the prevention of biofilms on various surfaces.",Lima EMF; Winans SC; Pinto UM,Heliyon,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37449109/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37443594,A Comprehensive Review of Recent Advances in Artificial Intelligence for Dentistry E-Health.,"Artificial intelligence has made substantial progress in medicine. Automated dental imaging interpretation is one of the most prolific areas of research using AI. X-ray and infrared imaging systems have enabled dental clinicians to identify dental diseases since the 1950s. However, the manual process of dental disease assessment is tedious and error-prone when diagnosed by inexperienced dentists. Thus, researchers have employed different advanced computer vision techniques, and machine- and deep-learning models for dental disease diagnoses using X-ray and near-infrared imagery. Despite the notable development of AI in dentistry, certain factors affect the performance of the proposed approaches, including limited data availability, imbalanced classes, and lack of transparency and interpretability. Hence, it is of utmost importance for the research community to formulate suitable approaches, considering the existing challenges and leveraging findings from the existing studies. Based on an extensive literature review, this survey provides a brief overview of X-ray and near-infrared imaging systems. Additionally, a comprehensive insight into challenges faced by researchers in the dental domain has been brought forth in this survey. The article further offers an amalgamative assessment of both performances and methods evaluated on public benchmarks and concludes with ethical considerations and future research avenues.",Shafi I; Fatima A; Afzal H; Díez IT; Lipari V; Breñosa J; Ashraf I,"Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37443594/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37432384,"Clinical Outcomes of the Deleterious Effects of Aluminum on Neuro-Cognition, Inflammation, and Health: A Review.","<b>Introduction:</b> In the scenario of metal toxicity, aluminum (Al) stands out as a ubiquitous type of metal that can be combined with other elements and form different compounds. Al is widely used daily as an adjuvant in vaccines, antacids, food additives (as components of AI-containing food additives), skin care products, cosmetics, and kitchenware, and can be an element or contaminant present in our daily life. <b>Objective:</b> To present a review of the main deleterious effects of Al on human health. <b>Methods:</b> The search was carried out from September 2022 to February 2023 in the Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct, Scielo, and Google Scholar databases, using scientific articles from 2012 to 2023. The quality of the studies was based on the GRADE instrument, and the risk of bias was analyzed according to the Cochrane instrument. <b>Results and Conclusions:</b> A total of 115 files were search returned. Further, 95 articles were evaluated, and 44 were included in this review. Based on the results, measuring Al's relevance to health is essential in medicine. Several studies have demonstrated clinical outcomes and metabolic alterations with Al exposure. The tolerable weekly intake established by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) of 1 mg Al/kg body weight can be achieved through dietary exposure alone. Proven neurotoxicity in humans is the critical adverse effect of Al. A carcinogenic effect of Al has not been proven so far. Preventive medicine advocates that exposure to Al should be kept as low as possible. Chelating agents, such as calcium disodium ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid and deferoxamine, are options for acute poisoning, and monomethysilanetriol supplementation may be a long-term strategy with chelation potential. Further studies are needed to assess the impacts of Al on human health.",Renke G; Almeida VBP; Souza EA; Lessa S; Teixeira RL; Rocha L; Sousa PL; Starling-Soares B,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37432384/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37432381,Dietary Oncopharmacognosy as a Crosswalk between Precision Oncology and Precision Nutrition.,"While diet and nutrition are modifiable risk factors for many chronic and infectious diseases, their role in cancer prevention and control remains under investigation. The lack of clarity of some diet-cancer relationships reflects the ongoing debate about the relative contribution of genetic factors, environmental exposures, and replicative errors in stem cell division as determinate drivers of cancer risk. In addition, dietary guidance has often been based upon research assuming that the effects of diet and nutrition on carcinogenesis would be uniform across populations and for various tumor types arising in a specific organ, i.e., that one size fits all. Herein, we present a paradigm for investigating precision dietary patterns that leverages the approaches that led to successful small-molecule inhibitors in cancer treatment, namely understanding the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of small molecules for targeting carcinogenic mechanisms. We challenge the scientific community to refine the paradigm presented and to conduct proof-in-concept experiments that integrate existing knowledge (drug development, natural products, and the food metabolome) with developments in artificial intelligence to design and then test dietary patterns predicted to elicit drug-like effects on target tissues for cancer prevention and control. We refer to this precision approach as dietary oncopharmacognosy and envision it as the crosswalk between the currently defined fields of precision oncology and precision nutrition with the goal of reducing cancer deaths.",Thompson HJ; Lutsiv T; McGinley JN; Hussan H; Playdon MC,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37432381/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37427580,Food matrix-flavonoid interactions and their effect on bioavailability.,"Flavonoid compounds exhibit a wide range of health benefits as plant-derived dietary components. Typically, co-consumed with the food matrix,they must be released from the matrix and converted into an absorbable form (bioaccessibility) before reaching the small intestine, where they are eventually absorbed and transferred into the bloodstream (bioavailability) to exert their biological activity. However, a large number of studies have revealed the biological functions of individual flavonoid compounds in different experimental models, ignoring the more complex but common relationships established in the diet. Besides, it has been appreciated that the gut microbiome plays a crucial role in the metabolism of flavonoids and food substrates, thereby having a significant impact on their interactions, but much progress still needs to be made in this area. Therefore, this review intends to comprehensively investigate the interactions between flavonoids and food matrices, including lipids, proteins, carbohydrates and minerals, and their effects on the nutritional properties of food matrices and the bioaccessibility and bioavailability of flavonoid compounds. Furthermore, the health effects of the interaction of flavonoid compounds with the gut microbiome have also been discussed.HIGHLIGHTSFlavonoids are able to bind to nutrients in the food matrix through covalent or non-covalent bonds.Flavonoids affect the digestion and absorption of lipids, proteins, carbohydrates and minerals in the food matrix (bioaccessibility).Lipids, proteins and carbohydrates may favorably affect the bioavailability of flavonoids.Improved intestinal flora may improve flavonoid bioavailability.",Zhang J; Wang H; Ai C; Lu R; Chen L; Xiao J; Teng H,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37427580/,1,0,0,0,0,0

This population experiences difficulties finding culturally appropriate foods and navigating the US food environment (FE), is highly food insecure (FI), and vulnerable to mental disorders. This review examined the current evidence for AIs' food and mental health outcomes and connections; and identified gaps in the literature and future research opportunities. A literature search was conducted using Google Scholar, PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and SCOPUS. Twenty-one studies were identified, reporting high (37-85%) FI rates, poor diet quality, and increased risk of mental disorders among participants. Challenges in the FE, lack of transportation, limited access to ethnic foods, low SES, and language barriers were associated with FI and poor diet quality. Similarly, discrimination, substance use, and immigration status were associated with depression and anxiety. However, studies examining the connection between AI's food experience and mental health are lacking. AIs are at a higher risk for FI, poor diet quality, and mental disorders. Ethnic-specific research to understand the connection between their food and mental health is needed to reduce nutrition and mental health disparities.",Dualle MA; Robinette LM; Hatsu IE,Journal of immigrant and minority health,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37400706/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37396595,Serum amyloid A and metabolic disease: evidence for a critical role in chronic inflammatory conditions.,"Serum amyloid A (SAA) subtypes 1-3 are well-described acute phase reactants that are elevated in acute inflammatory conditions such as infection, tissue injury, and trauma, while SAA4 is constitutively expressed. SAA subtypes also have been implicated as playing roles in chronic metabolic diseases including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, and possibly in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Distinctions between the expression kinetics of SAA in acute inflammatory responses and chronic disease states suggest the potential for differentiating SAA functions. Although circulating SAA levels can rise up to 1,000-fold during an acute inflammatory event, elevations are more modest (∼5-fold) in chronic metabolic conditions. The majority of acute-phase SAA derives from the liver, while in chronic inflammatory conditions SAA also derives from adipose tissue, the intestine, and elsewhere. In this review, roles for SAA subtypes in chronic metabolic disease states are contrasted to current knowledge about acute phase SAA. Investigations show distinct differences between SAA expression and function in human and animal models of metabolic disease, as well as sexual dimorphism of SAA subtype responses.",den Hartigh LJ; May KS; Zhang XS; Chait A; Blaser MJ,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37396595/,1,0,0,0,0,0

For understanding contextual determinants, the resources provided by technological advances could become a key factor in obesogenic environment research. This study aims to identify different sources of non-traditional data and their applications, considering the domains of obesogenic environments: physical, sociocultural, political and economic. We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, Scopus and LILACS databases by two independent groups of reviewers, from September to December 2021. We included those studies oriented to adult obesity research using non-traditional data sources, published in the last 5 years in English, Spanish or Portuguese. The overall reporting followed the PRISMA guidelines. The initial search yielded 1583 articles, 94 articles were kept for full-text screening, and 53 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included. We extracted information about countries of origin, study design, observation units, obesity-related outcomes, environment variables, and non-traditional data sources used. Our results revealed that most of the studies originated from high-income countries (86.54%) and used geospatial data within a GIS (76.67%), social networks (16.67%), and digital devices (11.66%) as data sources. Geospatial data were the most utilised data source and mainly contributed to the study of the physical domains of obesogenic environments, followed by social networks providing data to the analysis of the sociocultural domain. A gap in the literature exploring the political domain of environments was also evident. The disparities between countries are noticeable. Geospatial and social network data sources contributed to studying the physical and sociocultural environments, which could be a valuable complement to those traditionally used in obesity research.

Previously, fetal sex has been identified to modify the risks of maternal asthma, pre-eclampsia, and gestational diabetes. One study demonstrated increased risk of placental malaria in women carrying a female fetus. We investigated the association between fetal sex and malaria in pregnancy in 11 pregnancy studies conducted in sub-Saharan African countries and Papua New Guinea through meta-analysis using log binomial regression fitted to a random-effects model. Malaria infection during pregnancy and delivery was assessed using light microscopy, polymerase chain reaction, and histology. Five studies were observational studies and six were randomised controlled trials. Studies varied in terms of gravidity, gestational age at antenatal enrolment and bed net use. Presence of a female fetus was associated with malaria infection at enrolment by light microscopy (risk ratio 1.14 [95% confidence interval 1.04, 1.24]; P = 0.003; n = 11,729). Fetal sex did not associate with malaria infection when other time points or diagnostic methods were used.

37362852,A Strategic Research Framework for Defeating Diabetes in India: A 21st-Century Agenda.,"Indian people are at high risk for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) even at younger ages and lower body weights. Already 74 million people in India have the disease, and the proportion of those with T2DM is increasing across all strata of society. Unique aspects, related to lower insulin secretion or function, and higher hepatic fat deposition, accompanied by the rise in overweight (related to lifestyle changes) may all be responsible for this unrelenting epidemic of T2DM. Yet, research to understand the causes, pathophysiology, phenotypes, prevention, treatment, and healthcare delivery of T2DM in India seriously lags behind. There are major opportunities for scientific discovery and technological innovation, which if tapped can generate solutions for T2DM relevant to the country's context and make leading contributions to global science. We analyze the situation of T2DM in India, and present a four-pillar (etiology, precision medicine, implementation research, and health policy) strategic research framework to tackle the challenge.

37359550,From support to therapy: rethinking the role of nutrition in acute graft-versus-host disease.,"Allogeneic Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) offers a potential cure for patients with hematologic malignancies. Unfortunately, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a major obstacle to the greater success of this treatment. Despite intensive research efforts over the past several decades, GVHD is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients receiving allogeneic HSCT. The genetic disparity between donor and recipient is the primary factor that dictates the extent of alloimmune response and the severity of acute GVHD (aGVHD). However, some nongenetic factors are also actively involved in GVHD pathogenesis. Thus, identifying host factors that can be readily modified to reduce GVHD risk is of important clinical significance. We are particularly interested in the potential role of nutrition, as a nongenetic factor, in the etiology and management of aGVHD. In this article, we summarize recent findings regarding how different routes of nutritional support and various dietary factors affect aGVHD. Since diet is one of the most important factors that shape gut microbiota, we also provide evidence for a potential link between certain nutrients and gut microbiota in recipients of allogeneic HSCT. We propose a shifting role of nutrition from support to therapy in GVHD by targeting gut microbiota.",Limpert R; Pan P; Wang LS; Chen X,Frontiers in immunology,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37359550/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37353578,Systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of chatbots on lifestyle behaviours.,"Chatbots (also known as conversational agents and virtual assistants) offer the potential to deliver healthcare in an efficient, appealing and personalised manner. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of chatbot interventions designed to improve physical activity, diet and sleep. Electronic databases were searched for randomised and non-randomised controlled trials, and pre-post trials that evaluated chatbot interventions targeting physical activity, diet and/or sleep, published before 1 September 2022. Outcomes were total physical activity, steps, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), fruit and vegetable consumption, sleep quality and sleep duration. Standardised mean differences (SMD) were calculated to compare intervention effects. Subgroup analyses were conducted to assess chatbot type, intervention type, duration, output and use of artificial intelligence. Risk of bias was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment tool. Nineteen trials were included. Sample sizes ranged between 25-958, and mean participant age ranged between 9-71 years. Most interventions (n = 15, 79%) targeted physical activity, and most trials had a low-quality rating (n = 14, 74%). Meta-analysis results showed significant effects (all p < 0.05) of chatbots for increasing total physical activity (SMD = 0.28 [95% CI = 0.16, 0.40]), daily steps (SMD = 0.28 [95% CI = 0.17, 0.39]), MVPA (SMD = 0.53 [95% CI = 0.24, 0.83]), fruit and vegetable consumption (SMD = 0.59 [95% CI = 0.25, 0.93]), sleep duration (SMD = 0.44 [95% CI = 0.32, 0.55]) and sleep quality (SMD = 0.50 [95% CI = 0.09, 0.90]). Subgroup analyses showed that text-based, and artificial intelligence chatbots were more efficacious than speech/voice chatbots for fruit and vegetable consumption, and multicomponent interventions were more efficacious than chatbot-only interventions for sleep duration and sleep quality (all p < 0.05). Findings from this systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that chatbot interventions are efficacious for increasing physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, sleep duration and sleep quality. Chatbot interventions were efficacious across a range of populations and age groups, with both short- and longer-term interventions, and chatbot only and multicomponent interventions being efficacious.",Singh B; Olds T; Brinsley J; Dumuid D; Virgara R; Matricciani L; Watson A; Szeto K; Eglitis E; Miatke A; Simpson CEM; Vandelanotte C; Maher C,NPJ digital medicine,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37353578/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37343853,Investigating the effects of organic amendments on soil microbial composition and its linkage to soil organic carbon: A global meta-analysis.,"Understanding the dynamics of soil microbial communities responsible for soil element cycling is vital to understanding organic amendments' mechanisms in agricultural soil. However, several studies show inconsistencies in whether and how organic amendments affect the taxonomic composition of soil microbial communities compared to the application of sole chemical fertilizers. This first global meta-analysis demonstrated that organic amendments increased the bacterial diversity indices (Shannon and Chao1) but had no significant effect on fungal diversity indices. When considering both bulk and rhizosphere soils, only copiotrophic strategies such as Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Zygomycota phylum demonstrated a significant increase in response to organic amendments, mainly because the environment with a significant increase in nutrients content preferentially supports the growth of copiotrophic species after the use of organic amendments. Additionally, the factors influencing the response of different dominant microbial phyla to organic amendments varied. Besides soil pH, the effect of organic amendments on different microbial phyla was significantly influenced by soil texture, organic fertilizer type, crop type, and climate type, providing insights into the diverse responses of microbial communities to organic amendments under varying conditions. Organic amendments significantly increased soil organic carbon (SOC) content and enzyme activities related to nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) decomposition but had no significant effect on enzymes related to carbon (C) decomposition. Notably, the effect of organic amendments on the relative abundance of three dominant phyla (Mortierellomycota, Nitrospirae, and Firmicutes) was related to the effect on SOC, where the increase in the relative abundance of Firmicutes was significantly positively associated with the increase in SOC. This result has implications for understanding the relationship between the dynamics of microbial community composition and C turnover in agroecosystems.",Cui J; Yang B; Zhang M; Song D; Xu X; Ai C; Liang G; Zhou W,The Science of the total environment,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37343853/,0,0,0,1,0,0
37336327,Lifestyle-related risk factors and their cumulative associations with hippocampal and total grey matter volume across the adult lifespan: A pooled analysis in the European Lifebrain consortium.,"Lifestyle-related risk factors, such as obesity, physical inactivity, short sleep, smoking and alcohol use, have been associated with low hippocampal and total grey matter volumes (GMV). However, these risk factors have mostly been assessed as separate factors, leaving it unknown if variance explained by these factors is overlapping or additive. We investigated associations of five lifestyle-related factors separately and cumulatively with hippocampal and total GMV, pooled across eight European cohorts. We included 3838 participants aged 18-90 years from eight cohorts of the European Lifebrain consortium. Using individual person data, we performed cross-sectional meta-analyses on associations of presence of lifestyle-related risk factors separately (overweight/obesity, physical inactivity, short sleep, smoking, high alcohol use) as well as a cumulative unhealthy lifestyle score (counting the number of present lifestyle-related risk factors) with FreeSurfer-derived hippocampal volume and total GMV. Lifestyle-related risk factors were defined according to public health guidelines. High alcohol use was associated with lower hippocampal volume (r = -0.10, p = 0.021), and overweight/obesity with lower total GMV (r = -0.09, p = 0.001). Other lifestyle-related risk factors were not significantly associated with hippocampal volume or GMV. The cumulative unhealthy lifestyle score was negatively associated with total GMV (r = -0.08, p = 0.001), but not hippocampal volume (r = -0.01, p = 0.625). This large pooled study confirmed the negative association of some lifestyle-related risk factors with hippocampal volume and GMV, although with small effect sizes. Lifestyle factors should not be seen in isolation as there is evidence that having multiple unhealthy lifestyle factors is associated with a linear reduction in overall brain volume.",Binnewies J; Nawijn L; Brandmaier AM; Baaré WFC; Boraxbekk CJ; Demnitz N; Drevon CA; Fjell AM; Lindenberger U; Madsen KS; Nyberg L; Topiwala A; Walhovd KB; Ebmeier KP; Penninx BWJH,Brain research bulletin,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37336327/,0,0,0,1,0,0
37298303,"Hyperglycemia and Oxidative Stress: An Integral, Updated and Critical Overview of Their Metabolic Interconnections.","This review focuses on the multiple and reciprocal relationships that exist between oxidative stress, hyperglycemia and diabetes and related metabolic disorders. Human metabolism uses most of the consumed glucose under aerobic conditions. Oxygen is needed in the mitochondria to obtain energy, as well as for the action of microsomal oxidases and cytosolic pro-oxidant enzymes. This relentlessly generates a certain amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Although ROS are intracellular signals necessary for some physiological processes, their accumulation leads to oxidative stress, hyperglycemia, and progressive resistance to insulin. A cellular pro-oxidant versus an antioxidant equilibrium would regulate ROS levels, but oxidative stress, hyperglycemia, and pro-inflammatory conditions feed back to each other and the relevance of the interconnections tends to increase those conditions. Hyperglycemia promotes collateral glucose metabolism through protein kinase C, polyols and hexosamine routes. In addition, it also facilitates spontaneous glucose auto-oxidation and the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which in turn interact with their receptors (RAGE). The mentioned processes undermine cellular structures, finally giving place to a progressively greater degree of oxidative stress with further hyperglycemia, metabolic alterations, and diabetes complications. NFκB is the major transcription factor involved in the expression of most of the pro-oxidant mediators, while Nrf2 is the major transcription factor regulating the antioxidant response. FoxO is also involved in the equilibrium, but its role is controversial. This review summarizes the key factors linking the diverse glucose metabolic routes enhanced in hyperglycemia with ROS formation and vice versa, emphasizing the role of the major transcription factors involved in the desirable balance between pro-oxidant and antioxidant proteins.",González P; Lozano P; Ros G; Solano F,International journal of molecular sciences,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37298303/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We aim to examine the current state, limitations, and future directions of AI in thyroidology. <b><i>Summary:</i></b> AI has been explored in thyroidology since the 1990s, and currently, there is an increasing interest in applying AI to improve the care of patients with thyroid nodules (TNODs), thyroid cancer, and functional or autoimmune thyroid disease. These applications aim to automate processes, improve the accuracy and consistency of diagnosis, personalize treatment, decrease the burden for health care professionals, improve access to specialized care in areas lacking expertise, deepen the understanding of subtle pathophysiologic patterns, and accelerate the learning curve of less experienced clinicians. There are promising results for many of these applications. Yet, most are in the validation or early clinical evaluation stages. Only a few are currently adopted for risk stratification of TNODs by ultrasound and determination of the malignant nature of indeterminate TNODs by molecular testing. Challenges of the currently available AI applications include the lack of prospective and multicenter validations and utility studies, small and low diversity of training data sets, differences in data sources, lack of explainability, unclear clinical impact, inadequate stakeholder engagement, and inability to use outside of the research setting, which might limit the value of their future adoption. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> AI has the potential to improve many aspects of thyroidology; however, addressing the limitations affecting the suitability of AI interventions in thyroidology is a prerequisite to ensure that AI provides added value for patients with thyroid disease.",Toro-Tobon D; Loor-Torres R; Duran M; Fan JW; Singh Ospina N; Wu Y; Brito JP,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37279303/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37274071,Paediatric gastrointestinal endoscopy in the Asian-Pacific region: Recent advances in diagnostic and therapeutic techniques.,"There has been a rapid expansion in the knowledge of paediatric gastroenterology over the recent decade, with a fast-growing repertoire of diagnostic techniques and management strategies for a wide spectrum of childhood gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. Paediatric GI endoscopy is a core competency every paediatric gastroenterologist should possess, and represents one of the most common procedures performed in children for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Yet there remains a dearth of literature on the utility and outcomes of paediatric GI endoscopy in the Asia-Pacific region. Data on the diagnostic value of paediatric GI endoscopy would be an important aspect of discussion, with the emergence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and eosinophilic GI disease as increasingly common endoscopic diagnoses. Time-based trends in paediatric GI endoscopy do point towards more IBD and gastroesophageal reflux disease-related complications being diagnosed, with a declining incidence of GI bleeding. However, the real-world diagnostic value of endoscopy in Asia must be contextualised to the region-specific prevalence of paediatric GI diseases. <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection, particularly that of multidrug-resistant strains, remains a highly prevalent problem in specific regions. Paediatric functional GI disorders still account for the majority of childhood GI complaints in most centres, hence the diagnostic yield of endoscopy should be critically evaluated in the absence of alarm symptoms. GI therapeutic endoscopy is also occasionally required for children with ingested foreign bodies, intestinal polyposis or oesophageal strictures requiring dilation. Endoscopic haemostasis is a potentially life-saving skill in cases of massive GI bleeding typically from varices or peptic ulcers. Advanced endoscopic techniques such as capsule endoscopy and balloon-assisted enteroscopy have found traction, particularly in East Asian centres, as invaluable diagnostic and therapeutic tools in the management of IBD, obscure GI bleeding and intestinal polyposis. State of the art endoscopic diagnostics and therapeutics, including the use of artificial intelligence-aided endoscopy algorithms, real-time confocal laser endomicroscopy and peroral endoscopic myotomy, are expected to gain more utility in paediatrics. As paediatric gastroenterology matures as a subspecialty in Asia, it is essential current paediatric endoscopists and future trainees adhere to minimum practice standards, and keep abreast of the evolving trends in the diagnostic and therapeutic value of endoscopy. This review discusses the available published literature on the utility of paediatric GI endoscopy in Asia Pacific, with the relevant clinical outcomes.",Huang JG; Tanpowpong P,World journal of gastroenterology,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37274071/,1,0,0,0,0,0

As such, they have revolutionized healthcare, including in the liver pathology field. The present study aims to provide a systematic review of applications and performances provided by DNN algorithms in liver pathology throughout the Pubmed and Embase databases up to December 2022, for tumoral, metabolic and inflammatory fields. 42 articles were selected and fully reviewed. Each article was evaluated through the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool, highlighting their risks of bias. DNN-based models are well represented in the field of liver pathology, and their applications are diverse. Most studies, however, presented at least one domain with a high risk of bias according to the QUADAS-2 tool. Hence, DNN models in liver pathology present future opportunities and persistent limitations. To our knowledge, this review is the first one solely focused on DNN-based applications in liver pathology, and to evaluate their bias through the lens of the QUADAS2 tool.",Allaume P; Rabilloud N; Turlin B; Bardou-Jacquet E; Loréal O; Calderaro J; Khene ZE; Acosta O; De Crevoisier R; Rioux-Leclercq N; Pecot T; Kammerer-Jacquet SF,"Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37238283/,1,0,0,0,0,0

However, while dietary sciences have been rapidly evolving to meet these challenges, validation and translation of experimental results into clinical practice remain limited for multiple reasons, including inherent ethnic, gender, and cultural interindividual variability, among other methodological, dietary reporting-related, and analytical issues. Recently, large clinical cohorts with artificial intelligence analytics have introduced new precision and personalized nutrition concepts that enable one to successfully bridge these gaps in a real-life setting. In this review, we highlight selected examples of case studies at the intersection between diet-disease research and artificial intelligence.

37174380,Advances in the Potential Application of 3D Food Printing to Enhance Elderly Nutritional Dietary Intake.,"The contradiction between the growing demand from consumers for ""nutrition & personalized"" food and traditional industrialized food production has consistently been a problem in the elderly diet that researchers face and discuss. Three-dimensional (3D) food printing could potentially offer a solution to this problem. This article reviews the recent research on 3D food printing, mainly including the use of different sources of protein to improve the performance of food ink printing, high internal phase emulsion or oleogels as a fat replacement and nutrition delivery system, and functional active ingredients and the nutrition delivery system. In our opinion, 3D food printing is crucial for improving the appetite and dietary intake of the elderly. The critical obstacles of 3D-printed food for the elderly regarding energy supplements, nutrition balance, and even the customization of the recipe in a meal are discussed in this paper. By combining big data and artificial intelligence technology with 3D food printing, comprehensive, personalized, and customized geriatric foods, according to the individual traits of each elderly consumer, will be realized via food raw materials-appearance-processing methods.

37173876,Artificial Intelligence in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Pancreatic Cystic Lesions and Adenocarcinoma.,"Pancreatic cancer is projected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States by 2030. This is in part due to the paucity of reliable screening and diagnostic options for early detection. Amongst known pre-malignant pancreatic lesions, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are the most prevalent. The current standard of care for the diagnosis and classification of pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) involves cross-sectional imaging studies and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and, when indicated, EUS-guided fine needle aspiration and cyst fluid analysis. However, this is suboptimal for the identification and risk stratification of PCLs, with accuracy of only 65-75% for detecting mucinous PCLs. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a promising tool that has been applied to improve accuracy in screening for solid tumors, including breast, lung, cervical, and colon cancer. More recently, it has shown promise in diagnosing pancreatic cancer by identifying high-risk populations, risk-stratifying premalignant lesions, and predicting the progression of IPMNs to adenocarcinoma. This review summarizes the available literature on artificial intelligence in the screening and prognostication of precancerous lesions in the pancreas, and streamlining the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.",Jiang J; Chao WL; Culp S; Krishna SG,Cancers,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37173876/,1,0,0,0,0,0

37145858,Feasibility and Acceptability of Chatbots for Nutrition and Physical Activity Health Promotion Among Adolescents: Systematic Scoping Review With Adolescent Consultation.,"Reducing lifestyle risk behaviors among adolescents depends on access to age-appropriate health promotion information. Chatbots-computer programs designed to simulate conversations with human users-have the potential to deliver health information to adolescents to improve their lifestyle behaviors and support behavior change, but research on the feasibility and acceptability of chatbots in the adolescent population is unknown. This systematic scoping review aims to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of chatbots in nutrition and physical activity interventions among adolescents. A secondary aim is to consult adolescents to identify features of chatbots that are acceptable and feasible. We searched 6 electronic databases from March to April 2022 (MEDLINE, Embase, Joanna Briggs Institute, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, the Association for Computing Machinery library, and the IT database Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers). Peer-reviewed studies were included that were conducted in the adolescent population (10-19 years old) without any chronic disease, except obesity or type 2 diabetes, and assessed chatbots used nutrition or physical activity interventions or both that encouraged individuals to meet dietary or physical activity guidelines and support positive behavior change. Studies were screened by 2 independent reviewers, with any queries resolved by a third reviewer. Data were extracted into tables and collated in a narrative summary. Gray literature searches were also undertaken. Results of the scoping review were presented to a diverse youth advisory group (N=16, 13-18 years old) to gain insights into this topic beyond what is published in the literature. The search identified 5558 papers, with 5 (0.1%) studies describing 5 chatbots meeting the inclusion criteria. The 5 chatbots were supported by mobile apps using a combination of the following features: personalized feedback, conversational agents, gamification, and monitoring of behavior change. Of the 5 studies, 2 (40.0%) studies focused on nutrition, 2 (40.0%) studies focused on physical activity, and 1 (20.0%) focused on both nutrition and physical activity. Feasibility and acceptability varied across the 5 studies, with usage rates above 50% in 3 (60.0%) studies. In addition, 3 (60.0%) studies reported health-related outcomes, with only 1 (20.0%) study showing promising effects of the intervention. Adolescents presented novel concerns around the use of chatbots in nutrition and physical activity interventions, including ethical concerns and the use of false or misleading information. Limited research is available on chatbots in adolescent nutrition and physical activity interventions, finding insufficient evidence on the acceptability and feasibility of chatbots in the adolescent population. Similarly, adolescent consultation identified issues in the design features that have not been mentioned in the published literature. Therefore, chatbot codesign with adolescents may help ensure that such technology is feasible and acceptable to an adolescent population.",Han R; Todd A; Wardak S; Partridge SR; Raeside R,JMIR human factors,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37145858/,0,0,0,0,0,0
37140973,"Quality, Usability, and Effectiveness of mHealth Apps and the Role of Artificial Intelligence: Current Scenario and Challenges.","The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data in medicine has increased in recent years. Indeed, the use of AI in mobile health (mHealth) apps could considerably assist both individuals and health care professionals in the prevention and management of chronic diseases, in a person-centered manner. Nonetheless, there are several challenges that must be overcome to provide high-quality, usable, and effective mHealth apps. Here, we review the rationale and guidelines for the implementation of mHealth apps and the challenges regarding quality, usability, and user engagement and behavior change, with a special focus on the prevention and management of noncommunicable diseases. We suggest that a cocreation-based framework is the best method to address these challenges. Finally, we describe the current and future roles of AI in improving personalized medicine and provide recommendations for developing AI-based mHealth apps. We conclude that the implementation of AI and mHealth apps for routine clinical practice and remote health care will not be feasible until we overcome the main challenges regarding data privacy and security, quality assessment, and the reproducibility and uncertainty of AI results. Moreover, there is a lack of both standardized methods to measure the clinical outcomes of mHealth apps and techniques to encourage user engagement and behavior changes in the long term. We expect that in the near future, these obstacles will be overcome and that the ongoing European project, Watching the risk factors (WARIFA), will provide considerable advances in the implementation of AI-based mHealth apps for disease prevention and health promotion.",Deniz-Garcia A; Fabelo H; Rodriguez-Almeida AJ; Zamora-Zamorano G; Castro-Fernandez M; Alberiche Ruano MDP; Solvoll T; Granja C; Schopf TR; Callico GM; Soguero-Ruiz C; Wägner AM,Journal of medical Internet research,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37140973/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We aimed to evaluate the performance and quality of AI algorithms that use radiomics features in predicting EGFR mutation status in patient with NSCLC. We searched PubMed (Medline), EMBASE, Web of Science, and IEEExplore for studies published up to February 28, 2022. Studies utilizing an AI algorithm (either conventional machine learning [cML] and deep learning [DL]) for predicting EGFR mutations in patients with NSLCL were included. We extracted binary diagnostic accuracy data and constructed a bivariate random-effects model to obtain pooled sensitivity, specificity, and 95% confidence interval. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021278738. Our search identified 460 studies, of which 42 were included. Thirty-five studies were included in the meta-analysis. The AI algorithms exhibited an overall area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.789 and pooled sensitivity and specificity levels of 72.2% and 73.3%, respectively. The DL algorithms outperformed cML in terms of AUC (0.822 vs. 0.775) and sensitivity (80.1% vs. 71.1%), but had lower specificity (70.0% vs. 73.8%, p-value < 0.001) compared to cML. Subgroup analysis revealed that the use of positron-emission tomography/computed tomography, additional clinical information, deep feature extraction, and manual segmentation can improve diagnostic performance. DL algorithms can serve as a novel method for increasing predictive accuracy and thus have considerable potential for use in predicting EGFR mutation status in patient with NSCLC. We also suggest that guidelines on using AI algorithms in medical image analysis should be developed with a focus on oncologic radiomics.",Nguyen HS; Ho DKN; Nguyen NN; Tran HM; Tam KW; Le NQK,Academic radiology,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37120403/,0,1,0,1,0,0
37107615,Human Genes Involved in the Interaction between Host and Gut Microbiome: Regulation and Pathogenic Mechanisms.,"The umbrella term ""human gut microbiota"" describes the complex ecosystem harboring our gut. It includes bacteria, viruses, protozoa, archaea, fungi, and yeasts. This taxonomic classification does not describe its functions, which encompass nutrients digestion and absorption, immune system regulation, and host metabolism. ""Gut microbiome"" indicates instead the genome belonging to these ""microbes"" actively involved in these functions. However, the interaction between the host genome and the microbial ones determines the fine functioning of our organism. We reviewed the data available in the scientific literature on the definition of gut microbiota, gut microbiome, and the data on human genes involved in the interaction with the latter. We consulted the main medical databases using the following keywords, acronyms, and their associations: gut microbiota, gut microbiome, human genes, immune function, and metabolism. Candidate human genes encoding enzymes, inflammatory cytokines, and proteins show similarity with those included in the gut microbiome. These findings have become available through newer artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms allowing big data analysis. From an evolutionary point of view, these pieces of evidence explain the strict and sophisticated interaction at the basis of human metabolism and immunity regulation in humans. They unravel more and more physiopathologic pathways included in human health and disease. Several lines of evidence also obtained through big data analysis support the bi-directional role of gut microbiome and human genome in host metabolism and immune system regulation.",Boccuto L; Tack J; Ianiro G; Abenavoli L; Scarpellini E,Genes,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37107615/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Adopting a data-driven perspective, risk-assessment methods for cold food chains are summarized based on qualitative risk assessment, quantitative risk assessment, and comprehensive qualitative and quantitative risk assessment. The advantages and disadvantages of each are summarized. Finally, the problems and challenges in current cold food chain risk-assessment research are summarized in three aspects: the data credibility of cold food chain traceability systems, cold-chain food safety audit methods, and nontraditional cold food chain risk assessment. Suggestions are given for strengthening the cold food chain risk-assessment system to provide a decision-making reference to help regulatory authorities take risk prevention and control measures.",Wang Q; Zhao Z; Wang Z,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37107471/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37102791,Data-Driven Elucidation of Flavor Chemistry.,"Flavor molecules are commonly used in the food industry to enhance product quality and consumer experiences but are associated with potential human health risks, highlighting the need for safer alternatives. To address these health-associated challenges and promote reasonable application, several databases for flavor molecules have been constructed. However, no existing studies have comprehensively summarized these data resources according to quality, focused fields, and potential gaps. Here, we systematically summarized 25 flavor molecule databases published within the last 20 years and revealed that data inaccessibility, untimely updates, and nonstandard flavor descriptions are the main limitations of current studies. We examined the development of computational approaches (e.g., machine learning and molecular simulation) for the identification of novel flavor molecules and discussed their major challenges regarding throughput, model interpretability, and the lack of gold-standard data sets for equitable model evaluation. Additionally, we discussed future strategies for the mining and designing of novel flavor molecules based on multi-omics and artificial intelligence to provide a new foundation for flavor science research.",Kou X; Shi P; Gao C; Ma P; Xing H; Ke Q; Zhang D,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37102791/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37100955,Apoptotic cell death in disease-Current understanding of the NCCD 2023.,"Apoptosis is a form of regulated cell death (RCD) that involves proteases of the caspase family. Pharmacological and genetic strategies that experimentally inhibit or delay apoptosis in mammalian systems have elucidated the key contribution of this process not only to (post-)embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis, but also to the etiology of multiple human disorders. Consistent with this notion, while defects in the molecular machinery for apoptotic cell death impair organismal development and promote oncogenesis, the unwarranted activation of apoptosis promotes cell loss and tissue damage in the context of various neurological, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, infectious, neoplastic and inflammatory conditions. Here, the Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death (NCCD) gathered to critically summarize an abundant pre-clinical literature mechanistically linking the core apoptotic apparatus to organismal homeostasis in the context of disease.",Vitale I; Pietrocola F; Guilbaud E; Aaronson SA; Abrams JM; Adam D; Agostini M; Agostinis P; Alnemri ES; Altucci L; Amelio I; Andrews DW; Aqeilan RI; Arama E; Baehrecke EH; Balachandran S; Bano D; Barlev NA; Bartek J; Bazan NG; Becker C; Bernassola F; Bertrand MJM; Bianchi ME; Blagosklonny MV; Blander JM; Blandino G; Blomgren K; Borner C; Bortner CD; Bove P; Boya P; Brenner C; Broz P; Brunner T; Damgaard RB; Calin GA; Campanella M; Candi E; Carbone M; Carmona-Gutierrez D; Cecconi F; Chan FK; Chen GQ; Chen Q; Chen YH; Cheng EH; Chipuk JE; Cidlowski JA; Ciechanover A; Ciliberto G; Conrad M; Cubillos-Ruiz JR; Czabotar PE; D'Angiolella V; Daugaard M; Dawson TM; Dawson VL; De Maria R; De Strooper B; Debatin KM; Deberardinis RJ; Degterev A; Del Sal G; Deshmukh M; Di Virgilio F; Diederich M; Dixon SJ; Dynlacht BD; El-Deiry WS; Elrod JW; Engeland K; Fimia GM; Galassi C; Ganini C; Garcia-Saez AJ; Garg AD; Garrido C; Gavathiotis E; Gerlic M; Ghosh S; Green DR; Greene LA; Gronemeyer H; Häcker G; Hajnóczky G; Hardwick JM; Haupt Y; He S; Heery DM; Hengartner MO; Hetz C; Hildeman DA; Ichijo H; Inoue S; Jäättelä M; Janic A; Joseph B; Jost PJ; Kanneganti TD; Karin M; Kashkar H; Kaufmann T; Kelly GL; Kepp O; Kimchi A; Kitsis RN; Klionsky DJ; Kluck R; Krysko DV; Kulms D; Kumar S; Lavandero S; Lavrik IN; Lemasters JJ; Liccardi G; Linkermann A; Lipton SA; Lockshin RA; López-Otín C; Luedde T; MacFarlane M; Madeo F; Malorni W; Manic G; Mantovani R; Marchi S; Marine JC; Martin SJ; Martinou JC; Mastroberardino PG; Medema JP; Mehlen P; Meier P; Melino G; Melino S; Miao EA; Moll UM; Muñoz-Pinedo C; Murphy DJ; Niklison-Chirou MV; Novelli F; Núñez G; Oberst A; Ofengeim D; Opferman JT; Oren M; Pagano M; Panaretakis T; Pasparakis M; Penninger JM; Pentimalli F; Pereira DM; Pervaiz S; Peter ME; Pinton P; Porta G; Prehn JHM; Puthalakath H; Rabinovich GA; Rajalingam K; Ravichandran KS; Rehm M; Ricci JE; Rizzuto R; Robinson N; Rodrigues CMP; Rotblat B; Rothlin CV; Rubinsztein DC; Rudel T; Rufini A; Ryan KM; Sarosiek KA; Sawa A; Sayan E; Schroder K; Scorrano L; Sesti F; Shao F; Shi Y; Sica GS; Silke J; Simon HU; Sistigu A; Stephanou A; Stockwell BR; Strapazzon F; Strasser A; Sun L; Sun E; Sun Q; Szabadkai G; Tait SWG; Tang D; Tavernarakis N; Troy CM; Turk B; Urbano N; Vandenabeele P; Vanden Berghe T; Vander Heiden MG; Vanderluit JL; Verkhratsky A; Villunger A; von Karstedt S; Voss AK; Vousden KH; Vucic D; Vuri D; Wagner EF; Walczak H; Wallach D; Wang R; Wang Y; Weber A; Wood W; Yamazaki T; Yang HT; Zakeri Z; Zawacka-Pankau JE; Zhang L; Zhang H; Zhivotovsky B; Zhou W; Piacentini M; Kroemer G; Galluzzi L,Cell death and differentiation,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37100955/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37096495,Fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile (Clostridium difficile).,"Clostridioides difficile (formerly known as Clostridium difficile) is a bacterium that can cause potentially life-threatening diarrheal illness in individuals with an unhealthy mixture of gut bacteria, known as dysbiosis, and can cause recurrent infections in nearly a third of infected individuals. The traditional treatment of recurrent C difficile infection (rCDI) includes antibiotics, which may further exacerbate dysbiosis. There is growing interest in correcting the underlying dysbiosis in rCDI using of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT); and there is a need to establish the benefits and harms of FMT for the treatment of rCDI based on data from randomized controlled trials. To evaluate the benefits and harms of donor-based fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection in immunocompetent people. We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 31 March 2022. We considered randomized trials of adults or children with rCDI for inclusion. Eligible interventions must have met the definition of FMT, which is the administration of fecal material containing distal gut microbiota from a healthy donor to the gastrointestinal tract of a person with rCDI. The comparison group included participants who did not receive FMT and were given placebo, autologous FMT, no intervention, or antibiotics with activity against C difficile. We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. proportion of participants with resolution of rCDI and 2. serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 3. treatment failure, 4. all-cause mortality, 5. withdrawal from study, 6. rate of new CDI infection after a successful FMT, 7. any adverse event, 8. quality of life, and 9. colectomy. We used the GRADE criteria to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome. We included six studies with 320 participants. Two studies were conducted in Denmark, and one each in the Netherlands, Canada, Italy, and the US. Four were single-center and two were multicenter studies. All studies included only adults. Five studies excluded people who were severely immunocompromised, with only one study including 10 participants who were receiving immunosuppressive therapy out of the 64 enrolled; these were similarly distributed between the FMT arm (4/24 or 17%) and comparison arms (6/40 or 15%). The route of administration was the upper gastrointestinal tract via a nasoduodenal tube in one study, two studies used enema only, two used colonoscopic only delivery, and one used either nasojejunal or colonoscopic delivery, depending on a clinical determination of whether the recipient could tolerate a colonoscopy. Five studies had at least one comparison group that received vancomycin. The risk of bias (RoB 2) assessments did not find an overall high risk of bias for any outcome. All six studies assessed the efficacy and safety of FMT for the treatment of rCDI. Pooled results from six studies showed that the use of FMT in immunocompetent participants with rCDI likely leads to a large increase in resolution of rCDI in the FMT group compared to control (risk ratio (RR) 1.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36 to 2.71; P = 0.02, I<sup>2</sup> = 63%; 6 studies, 320 participants; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 3; moderate-certainty evidence). Fecal microbiota transplantation probably results in a slight reduction in serious adverse events; however, the CIs around the summary estimate were wide (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.41; P = 0.24, I² = 26%; 6 studies, 320 participants; NNTB 12; moderate-certainty evidence). Fecal microbiota transplantation may result in a reduction in all-cause mortality; however, the number of events was small, and the CIs of the summary estimate were wide (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.45; P = 0.48, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 6 studies, 320 participants; NNTB 20; low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported colectomy rates. In immunocompetent adults with rCDI, FMT likely leads to a large increase in the resolution of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection compared to alternative treatments such as antibiotics. There was no conclusive evidence regarding the safety of FMT for the treatment of rCDI as the number of events was small for serious adverse events and all-cause mortality. Additional data from large national registry databases might be required to assess any short-term or long-term risks with using FMT for the treatment of rCDI. Elimination of the single study that included some immunocompromised people did not alter these conclusions. Due to the low number of immunocompromised participants enrolled, conclusions cannot be drawn about the risks or benefits of FMT for rCDI in the immunocompromised population.",Minkoff NZ; Aslam S; Medina M; Tanner-Smith EE; Zackular JP; Acra S; Nicholson MR; Imdad A,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37096495/,0,1,0,0,0,0
37094914,Nutritional intervention in the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.,"Lifestyle modification is the primary intervention to control NAFLD progression, but despite evidence-based effectiveness it is difficult to distinguish the benefits of nutrition from physical activity and the optimal diet composition is not established. Macronutrients as saturated fatty acids, sugars and animal proteins are harmful in NAFLD and the Mediterranean Diet reducing sugar, red meat and refined carbohydrates and increasing unsaturated-fatty-acids was reported to be beneficial. However one size cannot fit all since NAFLD is a multifaceted syndrome encompassing many diseases of unknown etiologies, different clinical severity and outcomes. Studies of the intestinal metagenome, provided new insights into the physio-pathological interplay between intestinal microbiota and NAFLD. How much the microbiota heterogeneity can influence response to diet remains unknown. New knowledge indicates that AI guided personalized nutrition based on clinic-pathologic and genetic data combined with pre/post nutritional intervention gut metagenomics/metabolomics will be part of the future management of NAFLD.",Brunetto MR; Salvati A; Petralli G; Bonino F,Best practice & research.

37094824,Fecal transplantation for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, relapsing disease of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract that is thought to be associated with a complex interplay between the immune system, the GI tract lining, the environment, and the gut microbiome, leading to an abnormal inflammatory response in genetically susceptible individuals. An altered composition of the gut's native microbiota, known as dysbiosis, may have a major role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD), two subtypes of IBD. There is growing interest in the correction of this underlying dysbiosis using fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). To evaluate the benefits and safety profile of FMT for treatment of IBD in adults and children versus autologous FMT, placebo, standard medication, or no intervention. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two clinical trial registries, and the reference sections of published trials through 22 December 2022. We included randomized controlled trials that studied adults and children with UC or CD. Eligible intervention arms used FMT, defined as the delivery of healthy donor stool containing gut microbiota to a recipient's GI tract, to treat UC or CD. Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion. Our primary outcomes were: 1. induction of clinical remission, 2. maintenance of clinical remission, and 3. serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4. any adverse events, 5. endoscopic remission, 6. quality of life, 7. clinical response, 8. endoscopic response, 9. withdrawals, 10. inflammatory markers, and 11. microbiome outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. We included 12 studies with 550 participants. Three studies were conducted in Australia; two in Canada; and one in each of the following: China, the Czech Republic, France, India, the Netherlands, and the USA. One study was conducted in both Israel and Italy. FMT was administered in the form of capsules or suspensions and delivered by mouth, nasoduodenal tube, enema, or colonoscopy. One study delivered FMT by both oral capsules and colonoscopy. Six studies were at overall low risk of bias, while the others had either unclear or high risk of bias. Ten studies with 468 participants, of which nine studies focused on adults and one focused on children, reported induction of clinical remission in people with UC at longest follow-up (range 6 to 12 weeks) and showed that FMT may increase rates of induction of clinical remission in UC compared to control (risk ratio (RR) 1.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 2.84; low-certainty evidence). Five studies showed that FMT may increase rates of induction of endoscopic remission in UC at longest follow-up (range 8 to 12 weeks); however, the CIs around the summary estimate were wide and included a possible null effect (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.29; low-certainty evidence). Nine studies with 417 participants showed that FMT may result in little to no difference in rates of any adverse events (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16; low-certainty evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.77, 95% CI 0.88 to 3.55; very low-certainty evidence) and improvement in quality of life (mean difference (MD) 15.34, 95% CI -3.84 to 34.52; very low-certainty evidence) when FMT was used to induce remission in UC. Two studies, of which one also contributed data for induction of remission in active UC, assessed maintenance of remission in people with controlled UC at longest follow-up (range 48 to 56 weeks). The evidence was very uncertain about the use of FMT for maintenance of clinical remission (RR 2.97, 95% CI 0.26 to 34.42; very low-certainty evidence) and endoscopic remission (RR 3.28, 95% CI 0.73 to 14.74; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence was also very uncertain about the risk of serious adverse events, risk of any adverse events, and improvement in quality of life when FMT was used to maintain remission in UC. None of the included studies assessed use of FMT for induction of remission in people with CD. One study with 21 participants reported data on FMT for maintenance of remission in people with CD. The evidence was very uncertain about the use of FMT for maintenance of clinical remission in CD at 24 weeks (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.36 to 4.14; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence was also very uncertain about the risk of serious or any adverse events when FMT was used to maintain remission in CD. None of the studies reported data on use of FMT for maintenance of endoscopic remission or improvement in quality of life in people with CD. FMT may increase the proportion of people with active UC who achieve clinical and endoscopic remission. The evidence was very uncertain about whether use of FMT in people with active UC impacted the risk of serious adverse events or improvement in quality of life. The evidence was also very uncertain about the use of FMT for maintenance of remission in people with UC, as well as induction and maintenance of remission in people with CD, and no conclusive statements could be made in this regard. Further studies are needed to address the beneficial effects and safety profile of FMT in adults and children with active UC and CD, as well as its potential to promote longer-term maintenance of remission in UC and CD.",Imdad A; Pandit NG; Zaman M; Minkoff NZ; Tanner-Smith EE; Gomez-Duarte OG; Acra S; Nicholson MR,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37094824/,1,0,0,0,0,1
37084008,Genetic and Molecular Contributors in Eosinophilic Esophagitis.,"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an allergic inflammatory esophageal disorder with a complex underlying genetic and molecular etiology. The interest of the scientific community in EoE has grown considerably over the past three decades, and the understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms involved in this disease has greatly increased. In this article, we aim to provide both historic aspects and updates on the recent genetic and molecular advances in the understanding of EoE. Although EoE is a relatively newly described disorder, much progress has been made toward identifying the genetic and molecular factors contributing to the disease pathogenesis by a variety of approaches with next-generation sequencing technologies, including genome-wide association study, whole exome sequencing, and bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing. This review highlights the multifaceted impacts of various findings that have shaped the current molecular and genetic landscape of EoE, providing insights that facilitate further understanding of the disease process.",Sato H; Osonoi K; Sharlin CS; Shoda T,Current allergy and asthma reports,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37084008/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37020647,Role of human milk oligosaccharide metabolizing bacteria in the development of atopic dermatitis/eczema.,"Despite affecting up to 20% of infants in the United States, there is no cure for atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as eczema. Atopy usually manifests during the first six months of an infant's life and is one predictor of later allergic health problems. A diet of human milk may offer protection against developing atopic dermatitis. One milk component, human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), plays an important role as a prebiotic in establishing the infant gut microbiome and has immunomodulatory effects on the infant immune system. The purpose of this review is to summarize the available information about bacterial members of the intestinal microbiota capable of metabolizing HMOs, the bacterial genes or metabolic products present in the intestinal tract during early life, and the relationship of these genes and metabolic products to the development of AD/eczema in infants. We find that specific HMO metabolism gene sets and the metabolites produced by HMO metabolizing bacteria may enable the protective role of human milk against the development of atopy because of interactions with the immune system. We also identify areas for additional research to further elucidate the relationship between the human milk metabolizing bacteria and atopy. Detailed metagenomic studies of the infant gut microbiota and its associated metabolomes are essential for characterizing the potential impact of human milk-feeding on the development of atopic dermatitis.",Rahman T; Sarwar PF; Potter C; Comstock SS; Klepac-Ceraj V,Frontiers in pediatrics,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37020647/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Current screening methods include endoscopy based and biomarker based approaches. This guideline is a joint official statement of the Asian Pacific Association of Gastroenterology (APAGE) and the Asian Pacific Society of Digestive Endoscopy (APSDE), developed in response to the increasing use of, and accumulating supportive evidence for the role of, non-invasive biomarkers for the diagnosis of CRC and its precursor lesions. A systematic review of 678 publications and a two stage Delphi consensus process involving 16 clinicians in various disciplines was undertaken to develop 32 evidence based and expert opinion based recommendations for the use of faecal immunochemical tests, faecal based tumour biomarkers or microbial biomarkers, and blood based tumour biomarkers for the detection of CRC and adenoma. Comprehensive up-to-date guidance is provided on indications, patient selection and strengths and limitations of each screening tool. Future research to inform clinical applications are discussed alongside objective measurement of research priorities. This joint APAGE-APSDE practice guideline is intended to provide an up-to-date guide to assist clinicians worldwide in utilising non-invasive biomarkers for CRC screening; it has particular salience for clinicians in the Asia-Pacific region.",Chan FKL; Wong MCS; Chan AT; East JE; Chiu HM; Makharia GK; Weller D; Ooi CJ; Limsrivilai J; Saito Y; Hang DV; Emery JD; Makmun D; Wu K; Ali RAR; Ng SC,Gut,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37019620/,0,1,0,0,0,0
37000154,Anticancer Activity of Region B Capsaicin Analogs.,"The heterocyclic vanilloid compound capsaicin is responsible for the spicy and pungent flavor of chili peppers. Several convergent studies have shown that capsaicin suppresses the growth of multiple human cancers. Apart from capsaicin, natural and synthetic capsaicin-like compounds display growth suppressive activity in human cancers. The pharmacophore of capsaicin is comprised of three regions, namely region A (the aromatic ring), region B (the amide bond), and region C (the side chain). The present manuscript describes the isolation and synthesis of capsaicin analogs which have structural modifications in region B of the molecule. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic properties, anticancer activity of region B capsaicin analogs, as well as the signaling pathways (underlying the growth-inhibitory effects of region B capsaicin analogs) have also been described. The discovery of novel, second-generation region B capsaicin analogs may foster the hope of innovative nutrition-based combination therapies in human cancers.",Brown KC; Modi KJ; Light RS; Cox AJ; Long TE; Gadepalli RS; Rimoldi JM; Miles SL; Rankin G; Valentovic M; Denning KL; Tirona MT; Finch PT; Hess JA; Dasgupta P,Journal of medicinal chemistry,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37000154/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36988898,In Vitro Human Gastrointestinal Tract Simulation Systems: A Panoramic Review.,"Simulated human gastrointestinal (GI) tract systems are important for their applications in the fields of probiotics, nutrition and health. To date, various in vitro gut systems have been available to study GI tract dynamics and its association with health. In contrast to in vivo investigations, which are constrained by ethical considerations, in vitro models have several benefits despite the challenges involved in mimicking the GI environment. These in vitro models can be used for a range of research, from simple to dynamic, with one compartment to several compartments. In this review, we present a panoramic development of in vitro GI models for the first time through an evolutionary timeline. We tried to provide insight on designing an in vitro gut model, especially for novices. Latest developments and scope for improvement based on the limitations of the existing models were highlighted. In conclusion, designing an in vitro GI model suitable for a particular application is a multifaceted task. The bio-mimicking of the GI tract specific to geometrical, anatomical and mechanical features remains a challenge for the development of effective in vitro GI models. Advances in computer technology, artificial intelligence and nanotechnology are going to be revolutionary for further development. Besides this, in silico high-throughput technologies and miniaturisation are key players in the success of making in vitro modelling cost-effective and reducing the burden of in vivo studies.",Dixit Y; Kanojiya K; Bhingardeve N; Ahire JJ; Saroj D,Probiotics and antimicrobial proteins,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36988898/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36986050,Nutritional and Behavioral Countermeasures as Medication Approaches to Relieve Motion Sickness: A Comprehensive Review.,"The mismatch in signals perceived by the vestibular and visual systems to the brain, also referred to as motion sickness syndrome, has been diagnosed as a challenging condition with no clear mechanism. Motion sickness causes undesirable symptoms during travel and in virtual environments that affect people negatively. Treatments are directed toward reducing conflicting sensory inputs, accelerating the process of adaptation, and controlling nausea and vomiting. The long-term use of current medications is often hindered by their various side effects. Hence, this review aims to identify non-pharmacological strategies that can be employed to reduce or prevent motion sickness in both real and virtual environments. Research suggests that activation of the parasympathetic nervous system using pleasant music and diaphragmatic breathing can help alleviate symptoms of motion sickness. Certain micronutrients such as hesperidin, menthol, vitamin C, and gingerol were shown to have a positive impact on alleviating motion sickness. However, the effects of macronutrients are more complex and can be influenced by factors such as the food matrix and composition. Herbal dietary formulations such as Tianxian and Tamzin were shown to be as effective as medications. Therefore, nutritional interventions along with behavioral countermeasures could be considered as inexpensive and simple approaches to mitigate motion sickness. Finally, we discussed possible mechanisms underlying these interventions, the most significant limitations, research gaps, and future research directions for motion sickness.",Rahimzadeh G; Tay A; Travica N; Lacy K; Mohamed S; Nahavandi D; Pławiak P; Qazani MC; Asadi H,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36986050/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36981168,Artificial Intelligence in Food Safety: A Decade Review and Bibliometric Analysis.,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have been powerful solutions used to improve food yield, quality, and nutrition, increase safety and traceability while decreasing resource consumption, and eliminate food waste. Compared with several qualitative reviews on AI in food safety, we conducted an in-depth quantitative and systematic review based on the Core Collection database of WoS (Web of Science). To discover the historical trajectory and identify future trends, we analysed the literature concerning AI technologies in food safety from 2012 to 2022 by CiteSpace. In this review, we used bibliometric methods to describe the development of AI in food safety, including performance analysis, science mapping, and network analysis by CiteSpace. Among the 1855 selected articles, China and the United States contributed the most literature, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences released the largest number of relevant articles. Among all the journals in this field, <i>PLoS ONE</i> and <i>Computers and Electronics in Agriculture</i> ranked first and second in terms of annual publications and co-citation frequency. The present character, hot spots, and future research trends of AI technologies in food safety research were determined. Furthermore, based on our analyses, we provide researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with the big picture of research on AI in food safety across the whole process, from precision agriculture to precision nutrition, through 28 enlightening articles.",Liu Z; Wang S; Zhang Y; Feng Y; Liu J; Zhu H,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36981168/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36973716,Digital behaviour change interventions to increase vegetable intake in adults: a systematic review.,"Digital interventions may help address low vegetable intake in adults, however there is limited understanding of the features that make them effective. We systematically reviewed digital interventions to increase vegetable intake to 1) describe the effectiveness of the interventions; 2) examine links between effectiveness and use of co-design, personalisation, behavioural theories, and/or a policy framework; and 3) identify other features that contribute to effectiveness. A systematic search strategy was used to identify eligible studies from MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, INFORMIT, IEEE Xplore and Clinical Trial Registries, published between January 2000 and August 2022. Digital interventions to increase vegetable intake were included, with effective interventions identified based on statistically significant improvement in vegetable intake. To identify policy-action gaps, studies were mapped across the three domains of the NOURISHING framework (i.e., behaviour change communication, food environment, and food system). Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane tools for randomized, cluster randomized and non-randomized trials. Of the 1,347 records identified, 30 studies were included. Risk of bias was high or serious in most studies (n = 25/30; 83%). Approximately one quarter of the included interventions (n = 8) were effective at improving vegetable intake. While the features of effective and ineffective interventions were similar, embedding of behaviour change theories (89% vs 61%) and inclusion of stakeholders in the design of the intervention (50% vs 38%) were more common among effective interventions. Only one (ineffective) intervention used true co-design. Although fewer effective interventions included personalisation (67% vs 81%), the degree of personalisation varied considerably between studies. All interventions mapped across the NOURISHING framework behaviour change communication domain, with one ineffective intervention also mapping across the food environment domain. Few digital interventions identified in this review were effective for increasing vegetable intake. Embedding behaviour change theories and involving stakeholders in intervention design may increase the likelihood of success. The under-utilisation of comprehensive co-design methods presents an opportunity to ensure that personalisation approaches better meet the needs of target populations. Moreover, future digital interventions should address both behaviour change and food environment influences on vegetable intake.",Livingstone KM; Rawstorn JC; Partridge SR; Godrich SL; McNaughton SA; Hendrie GA; Blekkenhorst LC; Maddison R; Zhang Y; Barnett S; Mathers JC; Packard M; Alston L,The international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36973716/,0,1,0,0,0,0

The majority of preclinical studies have been undertaken in adults, with the greatest progress being made in the context of colorectal cancer screening and surveillance. This development has only been possible with advances in deep learning, like the convolutional neural network model, which has enabled real-time detection of pathology. Comparatively, the majority of deep learning systems developed in inflammatory bowel disease have focused on predicting disease severity and were developed using still images rather than videos. The application of AI to pediatric endoscopy is in its infancy, thus providing an opportunity to develop clinically meaningful and fair systems that do not perpetuate societal biases.

This report provides a summary of the proceedings from the workshop. The goals of the workshop were to forge connections and identify gaps in knowledge that could guide future research directions. Presentations were segregated into six major theme areas, including 1) pancreas anatomy and physiology, 2) diabetes in the setting of exocrine disease, 3) metabolic influences on the exocrine pancreas, 4) genetic drivers of pancreatic diseases, 5) tools for integrated pancreatic analysis, and 6) implications of exocrine-endocrine cross talk. For each theme, multiple presentations were followed by panel discussions on specific topics relevant to each area of research; these are summarized here. Significantly, the discussions resulted in the identification of research gaps and opportunities for the field to address. In general, it was concluded that as a pancreas research community, we must more thoughtfully integrate our current knowledge of normal physiology as well as the disease mechanisms that underlie endocrine and exocrine disorders so that there is a better understanding of the interplay between these compartments.",Mastracci TL; Apte M; Amundadottir LT; Alvarsson A; Artandi S; Bellin MD; Bernal-Mizrachi E; Caicedo A; Campbell-Thompson M; Cruz-Monserrate Z; El Ouaamari A; Gaulton KJ; Geisz A; Goodarzi MO; Hara M; Hull-Meichle RL; Kleger A; Klein AP; Kopp JL; Kulkarni RN; Muzumdar MD; Naren AP; Oakes SA; Olesen SS; Phelps EA; Powers AC; Stabler CL; Tirkes T; Whitcomb DC; Yadav D; Yong J; Zaghloul NA; Pandol SJ; Sander M,Diabetes,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36940317/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36933603,Development of a Practical Guide to Implement and Monitor Diet Therapy for Eosinophilic Esophagitis.,"Dietary therapy for short- and long-term management of eosinophilic esophagitis is an effective yet poorly understood and underutilized treatment strategy. Despite several prospective trials demonstrating the efficacy of dietary therapies, successful clinical implementation is hampered by the need for a multidisciplinary approach including dietitian support and provider expertise. The availability of these resources is not readily available to most gastroenterologists. Without standardized guidance on starting or completing the diet for gastrointestinal providers and/or consulting dietitians, provider attitudes toward dietary therapy vary greatly depending on familiarity and knowledge gaps in using diet therapy. This review aims to summarize evidence in support of dietary therapy in eosinophilic esophagitis while providing guidance on initiation and implementation of dietary therapy for providers.",Chang JW; Kliewer K; Haller E; Lynett A; Doerfler B; Katzka DA; Peterson KA; Dellon ES; Gonsalves N,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36933603/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36906905,Human genetic and immunological determinants of SARS-CoV-2 and Epstein-Barr virus diseases in childhood: Insightful contrasts.,"There is growing evidence to suggest that severe disease in children infected with common viruses that are typically benign in other children can result from inborn errors of immunity or their phenocopies. Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a cytolytic respiratory RNA virus, can lead to acute hypoxemic COVID-19 pneumonia in children with inborn errors of type I interferon (IFN) immunity or autoantibodies against IFNs. These patients do not appear to be prone to severe disease during infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a leukocyte-tropic DNA virus that can establish latency. By contrast, various forms of severe EBV disease, ranging from acute hemophagocytosis to chronic or long-term illnesses, such as agammaglobulinemia and lymphoma, can manifest in children with inborn errors disrupting specific molecular bridges involved in the control of EBV-infected B cells by cytotoxic T cells. The patients with these disorders do not seem to be prone to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. These experiments of nature reveal surprising levels of redundancy of two different arms of immunity, with type I IFN being essential for host defense against SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory epithelial cells, and certain surface molecules on cytotoxic T cells essential for host defense against EBV in B lymphocytes.",Pan-Hammarström Q; Casanova JL,Journal of internal medicine,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36906905/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36900487,A Comprehensive Review of Pesticide Residues in Peppers.,"Pesticides are chemicals that are used to control pests such as insects, fungi, and weeds. Pesticide residues can remain on crops after application. Peppers are popular and versatile foods that are valued for their flavor, nutrition, and medicinal properties. The consumption of raw or fresh peppers (bell and chili) can have important health benefits due to their high levels of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Therefore, it is crucial to consider factors such as pesticide use and preparation methods to fully realize these benefits. Ensuring that the levels of pesticide residues in peppers are not harmful to human health requires rigorous and continuous monitoring. Several analytical methods, such as gas chromatography (GC), liquid chromatography (LC), mass spectrometry (MS), infrared spectroscopy (IR), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), can detect and quantify pesticide residues in peppers. The choice of analytical method depends on the specific pesticide, that is being tested for and the type of sample being analyzed. The sample preparation method usually involves several processes. This includes extraction, which is used to separate the pesticides from the pepper matrix, and cleanup, which removes any interfering substances that could affect the accuracy of the analysis. Regulatory agencies or food safety organizations typically monitor pesticide residues in peppers by stipulating maximum residue limits (MRLs). Herein, we discuss various sample preparation, cleanup, and analytical techniques, as well as the dissipation patterns and application of monitoring strategies for analyzing pesticides in peppers to help safeguard against potential human health risks. From the authors' perspective, several challenges and limitations exist in the analytical approach to monitoring pesticide residues in peppers. These include the complexity of the matrix, the limited sensitivity of some analytical methods, cost and time, a lack of standard methods, and limited sample size. Furthermore, developing new analytical methods, using machine learning and artificial intelligence, promoting sustainable and organic growing practices, improving sample preparation methods, and increasing standardization could assist efficiently in analyzing pesticide residues in peppers.",Shim JH; Eun JB; Zaky AA; Hussein AS; Hacimüftüoğlu A; Abd El-Aty AM,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36900487/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36900104,Application of Artificial Intelligence in Measuring Novel pH-Impedance Metrics for Optimal Diagnosis of GERD.,"Novel metrics extracted from pH-impedance monitoring can augment the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Artificial intelligence (AI) is being widely used to improve the diagnostic capabilities of various diseases. In this review, we update the current literature regarding applications of artificial intelligence in measuring novel pH-impedance metrics. AI demonstrates high performance in the measurement of impedance metrics, including numbers of reflux episodes and post-reflux swallow-induced peristaltic wave index and, furthermore, extracts baseline impedance from the entire pH-impedance study. AI is expected to play a reliable role in facilitating measuring novel impedance metrics in patients with GERD in the near future.",Wong MW; Rogers BD; Liu MX; Lei WY; Liu TT; Yi CH; Hung JS; Liang SW; Tseng CW; Wang JH; Wu PA; Chen CL,"Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36900104/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36899696,Goose Meat as a Source of Dietary Manganese-A Systematic Review.,"Manganese is a trace element with essential physiological functions that should be supplied to animals and humans through diet. Goose meat is prevalent in many regions of the world. Therefore, the aim of the study was a systematic review (PRISMA statement, 1980-2022) of the content of Mn in raw and cooked goose meat and their relation to the recommended intake at the level of adequate intake (AI) and the nutrient reference values-requirements (NRV-R). The literature analysis shows that the content of Mn in goose meat depends on the breed, type of muscles, the presence of skin, and the cooking method used. AI level recommendations for Mn intake range from 0.003 to 5.50 mg/day, depending on the country, age, and gender. Consumption by adults (regardless of sex) of 100 g of domestic or wild goose meat covers the daily AI per Mn in various percentages, depending on the type of muscles (more Mn in leg muscles), presence of skin (more Mn in skinless muscles), and thermal treatment (pan fried with oil, grilled, and cooked meat contains more). Placing information on the Mn content in goose meat and the percentage of NRV-R on the packaging may be valuable information for the consumer in making food choices to diversify the diet. There are few studies on the content of Mn in goose meat. Therefore, it is reasonable to conduct research in this area.",Goluch Z; Haraf G,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36899696/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36873390,Paraoxonase 1 and atherosclerosis.,"Paraoxonase 1 (PON1), residing almost exclusively on HDL, was discovered because of its hydrolytic activity towards organophosphates. Subsequently, it was also found to hydrolyse a wide range of substrates, including lactones and lipid hydroperoxides. PON1 is critical for the capacity of HDL to protect LDL and outer cell membranes against harmful oxidative modification, but this activity depends on its location within the hydrophobic lipid domains of HDL. It does not prevent conjugated diene formation, but directs lipid peroxidation products derived from these to become harmless carboxylic acids rather than aldehydes which might adduct to apolipoprotein B. Serum PON1 is inversely related to the incidence of new atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events, particularly in diabetes and established ASCVD. Its serum activity is frequently discordant with that of HDL cholesterol. PON1 activity is diminished in dyslipidaemia, diabetes, and inflammatory disease. Polymorphisms, most notably Q192R, can affect activity towards some substrates, but not towards phenyl acetate. Gene ablation or over-expression of human <i>PON1</i> in rodent models is associated with increased and decreased atherosclerosis susceptibility respectively. PON1 antioxidant activity is enhanced by apolipoprotein AI and lecithin:cholesterol acyl transferase and diminished by apolipoprotein AII, serum amyloid A, and myeloperoxidase. PON1 loses this activity when separated from its lipid environment. Information about its structure has been obtained from water soluble mutants created by directed evolution. Such recombinant PON1 may, however, lose the capacity to hydrolyse non-polar substrates. Whilst nutrition and pre-existing lipid modifying drugs can influence PON1 activity there is a cogent need for more specific PON1-raising medication to be developed.",Durrington PN; Bashir B; Soran H,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36873390/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36851683,Targeting <i>Aedes aegypti</i> Metabolism with Next-Generation Insecticides.,"<i>Aedes aegypti</i> is the primary vector of dengue virus (DENV), zika virus (ZIKV), and other emerging infectious diseases of concern. A key disease mitigation strategy is vector control, which relies heavily on the use of insecticides. The development of insecticide resistance poses a major threat to public health worldwide. Unfortunately, there is a limited number of chemical compounds available for vector control, and these chemicals can have off-target effects that harm invertebrate and vertebrate species. Fundamental basic science research is needed to identify novel molecular targets that can be exploited for vector control. Next-generation insecticides will have unique mechanisms of action that can be used in combination to limit selection of insecticide resistance. Further, molecular targets will be species-specific and limit off-target effects. Studies have shown that mosquitoes rely on key nutrients during multiple life cycle stages. Targeting metabolic pathways is a promising direction that can deprive mosquitoes of nutrition and interfere with development. Metabolic pathways are also important for the virus life cycle. Here, we review studies that reveal the importance of dietary and stored nutrients during mosquito development and infection and suggest strategies to identify next-generation insecticides with a focus on trehalase inhibitors.",Conway MJ; Haslitt DP; Swarts BM,Viruses,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36851683/,1,0,0,0,0,0

36849195,"Oral iron supplementation and anaemia in children according to schedule, duration, dose and cosupplementation: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 129 randomised trials.","WHO guidelines on iron supplementation among children call for further research to identify the optimal schedule, duration, dose and cosupplementation regimen. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials was undertaken. Randomised controlled trials providing ≥30 days of oral iron supplementation versus placebo or control to children and adolescents aged <20 years were eligible. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to summarise the potential benefits and harms of iron supplementation. Meta-regression was used to estimate iron effect heterogeneity. 129 trials with 201 intervention arms randomised 34 564 children. Frequent (3-7/week) and intermittent (1-2/week) iron regimens were similarly effective at decreasing anaemia, iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia (p heterogeneity >0.05), although serum ferritin levels and (after adjustment for baseline anaemia) haemoglobin levels increased more with frequent supplementation. Shorter (1-3 months) versus longer (7+ months) durations of supplementation generally showed similar benefits after controlling for baseline anaemia status, except for ferritin which increased more with longer duration of supplementation (p=0.04). Moderate-dose and high-dose supplements were more effective than low-dose supplements at improving haemoglobin (p=0.004), ferritin (p=0.008) and iron deficiency anaemia (p=0.02), but had similar effects to low-dose supplements for overall anaemia. Iron supplementation provided similar benefits when administered alone or in combination with zinc or vitamin A, except for an attenuated effect on overall anaemia when iron was cosupplemented with zinc (p=0.048). Weekly and shorter duration iron supplementation at moderate or high doses might be optimal approaches for children and adolescents at risk of deficiency.

36845306,Barriers to and solutions for representative inclusion across the lifespan and in life course research: The need for structural competency highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Exclusion of special populations (older adults; pregnant women, children, and adolescents; individuals of lower socioeconomic status and/or who live in rural communities; people from racial and ethnic minority groups; individuals from sexual or gender minority groups; and individuals with disabilities) in research is a pervasive problem, despite efforts and policy changes by the National Institutes of Health and other organizations. These populations are adversely impacted by social determinants of health (SDOH) that reduce access and ability to participate in biomedical research. In March 2020, the Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute hosted the ""Lifespan and Life Course Research: integrating strategies"" ""Un-Meeting"" to discuss barriers and solutions to underrepresentation of special populations in biomedical research. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted how exclusion of representative populations in research can increase health inequities. We applied findings of this meeting to perform a literature review of barriers and solutions to recruitment and retention of representative populations in research and to discuss how findings are important to research conducted during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We highlight the role of SDOH, review barriers and solutions to underrepresentation, and discuss the importance of a structural competency framework to improve research participation and retention among special populations.",LeCroy MN; Potter LN; Bandeen-Roche K; Bianco ME; Cappola AR; Carter EB; Dayan PS; Eckstrom E; Edwards DF; Farabi SS; Fisher SD; Giordano J; Hanson HA; Jenkins E; Juhn Y; Kaskel F; Stake CE; Reeds DN; Schleiss MR; Wafford QE; McColley SA,Journal of clinical and translational science,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36845306/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36840867,Prognostic models in COVID-19 infection that predict severity: a systematic review.,"Current evidence on COVID-19 prognostic models is inconsistent and clinical applicability remains controversial. We performed a systematic review to summarize and critically appraise the available studies that have developed, assessed and/or validated prognostic models of COVID-19 predicting health outcomes. We searched six bibliographic databases to identify published articles that investigated univariable and multivariable prognostic models predicting adverse outcomes in adult COVID-19 patients, including intensive care unit (ICU) admission, intubation, high-flow nasal therapy (HFNT), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and mortality. We identified and assessed 314 eligible articles from more than 40 countries, with 152 of these studies presenting mortality, 66 progression to severe or critical illness, 35 mortality and ICU admission combined, 17 ICU admission only, while the remaining 44 studies reported prediction models for mechanical ventilation (MV) or a combination of multiple outcomes. The sample size of included studies varied from 11 to 7,704,171 participants, with a mean age ranging from 18 to 93 years. There were 353 prognostic models investigated, with area under the curve (AUC) ranging from 0.44 to 0.99. A great proportion of studies (61.5%, 193 out of 314) performed internal or external validation or replication. In 312 (99.4%) studies, prognostic models were reported to be at high risk of bias due to uncertainties and challenges surrounding methodological rigor, sampling, handling of missing data, failure to deal with overfitting and heterogeneous definitions of COVID-19 and severity outcomes. While several clinical prognostic models for COVID-19 have been described in the literature, they are limited in generalizability and/or applicability due to deficiencies in addressing fundamental statistical and methodological concerns. Future large, multi-centric and well-designed prognostic prospective studies are needed to clarify remaining uncertainties.",Buttia C; Llanaj E; Raeisi-Dehkordi H; Kastrati L; Amiri M; Meçani R; Taneri PE; Ochoa SAG; Raguindin PF; Wehrli F; Khatami F; Espínola OP; Rojas LZ; de Mortanges AP; Macharia-Nimietz EF; Alijla F; Minder B; Leichtle AB; Lüthi N; Ehrhard S; Que YA; Fernandes LK; Hautz W; Muka T,European journal of epidemiology,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36840867/,0,1,0,0,0,0
36839269,Nuts and Cardiovascular Disease Outcomes: A Review of the Evidence and Future Directions.,"Nuts are nutrient-rich foods that contain many bioactive compounds that are beneficial for cardiovascular health. Higher consumption of nuts has been associated with a reduced risk of several cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in prospective cohort studies, including a 19% and 25% lower risk of CVD incidence and mortality, respectively, and a 24% and 27% lower risk of coronary heart disease incidence and mortality, respectively. An 18% lower risk of stroke mortality, a 15% lower risk of atrial fibrillation, and a 19% lower risk of total mortality have also been observed. The role of nuts in stroke incidence, stroke subtypes, peripheral arterial disease and heart failure has been less consistent. This narrative review summarizes recommendations for nuts by clinical practice guidelines and governmental organizations, epidemiological evidence for nuts and CVD outcomes, nut-containing dietary patterns, potential mechanisms of nuts and CVD risk reduction, and future research directions, such as the use of biomarkers to help better assess nut intake. Although there are still some uncertainties around nuts and CVD prevention which require further research, as summarized in this review, there is a substantial amount of evidence that supports that consuming nuts will have a positive impact on primary and secondary prevention of CVD.",Glenn AJ; Aune D; Freisling H; Mohammadifard N; Kendall CWC; Salas-Salvadó J; Jenkins DJA; Hu FB; Sievenpiper JL,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36839269/,1,0,0,0,0,1

Consumption of nuts and their inclusion in dietary patterns has been associated with a range of beneficial health outcomes. Diabetes guidelines recommend dietary patterns that incorporate nuts; however, specific recommendations related to nuts have been limited. This review considers the epidemiological and clinical evidence to date for the role of nut consumption as a dietary strategy for the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and related complications. Findings suggest nut consumption may have a potential role in the prevention and management of T2D, with mechanistic studies assessing nuts and individual nut-related nutritional constituents supporting this possibility. However, limited definitive evidence is available to date, and future studies are needed to elucidate better the impact of nuts on the prevention and management of T2D.",Nishi SK; Viguiliouk E; Kendall CWC; Jenkins DJA; Hu FB; Sievenpiper JL; Atzeni A; Misra A; Salas-Salvadó J,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36839236/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36828163,Current trends in natural products for the treatment and management of dementia: Computational to clinical studies.,"The number of preclinical and clinical studies evaluating natural products-based management of dementia has gradually increased, with an exponential rise in 2020 and 2021. Keeping this in mind, we examined current trends from 2016 to 2021 in order to assess the growth potential of natural products in the treatment of dementia. Publicly available literature was collected from various databases like PubMed and Google Scholar. Oxidative stress-related targets, NF-κB pathway, anti-tau aggregation, anti-AChE, and A-β aggregation were found to be common targets and pathways. A retrospective analysis of 33 antidementia natural compounds identified 125 sustainable resources distributed among 65 families, 39 orders, and 7 classes. We found that families such as Berberidaceae, Zingiberaceae, and Fabaceae, as well as orders such as Lamiales, Sapindales, and Myrtales, appear to be important and should be researched further for antidementia compounds. Moreover, some natural products, such as quercetin, curcumin, icariside II, berberine, and resveratrol, have a wide range of applications. Clinical studies and patents support the importance of dietary supplements and natural products, which we will also discuss.

The aim of this paper is to determine areas of consensus and disagreement among guidance and to understand current gaps in research. Overall, studied guidances showed consensus regarding patient empowerment and engagement, promoting independence, autonomy and liberty through; establishing person-centered care plans, providing ongoing care assessment, resources and support to individuals and their family/carers. Consensus was also seen in most end-of-life care issues; re-assessing care plans, rationalizing medication, and most importantly carer support and well-being. Disagreement could be found in criteria relating to decision-making after losing capacity, i.e. through appointment of case managers or a power of attorney, reducing barriers to equitable access of care, stigma and discrimination for minority and disadvantaged groups - including younger people with dementia, medicalized care strategies such as alternatives to hospitalization, covert administration, and assisted hydration and nutrition, and also in identifying an active dying phase.

36778129,An Overview: The Diversified Role of Mitochondria in Cancer Metabolism.,"Mitochondria are intracellular organelles involved in energy production, cell metabolism and cell signaling. They are essential not only in the process of ATP synthesis, lipid metabolism and nucleic acid metabolism, but also in tumor development and metastasis. Mutations in mtDNA are commonly found in cancer cells to promote the rewiring of bioenergetics and biosynthesis, various metabolites especially oncometabolites in mitochondria regulate tumor metabolism and progression. And mutation of enzymes in the TCA cycle leads to the unusual accumulation of certain metabolites and oncometabolites. Mitochondria have been demonstrated as the target for cancer treatment. Cancer cells rely on two main energy resources: oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis. By manipulating OXPHOS genes or adjusting the metabolites production in mitochondria, tumor growth can be restrained. For example, enhanced complex I activity increases NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH to prevent metastasis and progression of cancers. In this review, we discussed mitochondrial function in cancer cell metabolism and specially explored the unique role of mitochondria in cancer stem cells and the tumor microenvironment. Targeting the OXPHOS pathway and mitochondria-related metabolism emerging as a potential therapeutic strategy for various cancers.",Liu Y; Sun Y; Guo Y; Shi X; Chen X; Feng W; Wu LL; Zhang J; Yu S; Wang Y; Shi Y,International journal of biological sciences,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36778129/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36768637,Overview of Cellular and Soluble Mediators in Systemic Inflammation Associated with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently the most prevalent chronic liver disease in Western countries, affecting approximately 25% of the adult population. This condition encompasses a spectrum of liver diseases characterized by abnormal accumulation of fat in liver tissue (non-alcoholic fatty liver, NAFL) that can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), characterized by the presence of liver inflammation and damage. The latter form often coexists with liver fibrosis which, in turn, may progress to a state of cirrhosis and, potentially, hepatocarcinoma, both irreversible processes that often lead to the patient's death and/or the need for liver transplantation. Along with the high associated economic burden, the high mortality rate among NAFLD patients raises interest, not only in the search for novel therapeutic approaches, but also in early diagnosis and prevention to reduce the incidence of NAFLD-related complications. In this line, an exhaustive characterization of the immune status of patients with NAFLD is mandatory. Herein, we attempted to gather and compare the current and relevant scientific evidence on this matter, mainly on human reports. We addressed the current knowledge related to circulating cellular and soluble mediators, particularly platelets, different leukocyte subsets and relevant inflammatory soluble mediators.",Marques P; Francisco V; Martínez-Arenas L; Carvalho-Gomes Â; Domingo E; Piqueras L; Berenguer M; Sanz MJ,International journal of molecular sciences,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36768637/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36766784,Deciphering Interactions between Phosphorus Status and Toxic Metal Exposure in Plants and Rhizospheres to Improve Crops Reared on Acid Soil.,"Acid soils are characterized by deficiencies in essential nutrient elements, oftentimes phosphorus (P), along with toxicities of metal elements, such as aluminum (Al), manganese (Mn), and cadmium (Cd), each of which significantly limits crop production. In recent years, impressive progress has been made in revealing mechanisms underlying tolerance to high concentrations of Al, Mn, and Cd. Phosphorus is an essential nutrient element that can alleviate exposure to potentially toxic levels of Al, Mn, and Cd. In this review, recent advances in elucidating the genes responsible for the uptake, translocation, and redistribution of Al, Mn, and Cd in plants are first summarized, as are descriptions of the mechanisms conferring resistance to these toxicities. Then, literature highlights information on interactions of P nutrition with Al, Mn, and Cd toxicities, particularly possible mechanisms driving P alleviation of these toxicities, along with potential applications for crop improvement on acid soils. The roles of plant phosphate (Pi) signaling and associated gene regulatory networks relevant for coping with Al, Mn, and Cd toxicities, are also discussed. To develop varieties adapted to acid soils, future work needs to further decipher involved signaling pathways and key regulatory elements, including roles fulfilled by intracellular Pi signaling. The development of new strategies for remediation of acid soils should integrate the mechanisms of these interactions between limiting factors in acid soils.",Wang X; Ai S; Liao H,Cells,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36766784/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We aimed to describe the clinical, laboratory, and genetic features of six patients from four Mexican families. We performed exome sequencing in patients of four families with suspected actinopathy, collected their data from medical records, and reviewed the literature for reports of other patients with actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 1B deficiency. Six patients from four families were included. All had recurrent infections, mainly bacterial pneumonia, and cellulitis. A total of 67% had eczema whereas 50% had food allergies, failure to thrive, hepatomegaly, and bleeding. Eosinophilia was found in all; 84% had thrombocytopenia, 67% had abnormal-size platelets and anemia. Serum levels of IgG, IgA, and IgE were highly increased in most; IgM was normal or low. T cells were decreased in 67% of patients, whereas B and NK cells were increased in half of patients. Two of the four probands had compound heterozygous variants. One patient was successfully transplanted. We identified 28 other patients whose most prevalent features were eczema, recurrent infections, failure to thrive, bleeding, diarrhea, allergies, vasculitis, eosinophilia, platelet abnormalities, high IgE/IgA, low T cells, and high B cells.

Neglecting implant design and other technical errors in this scenario, unmonitored circumstances, and lack of post-surgery monitoring may ultimately lead to the implant system's failure and leave us with the only option of high-risk revision surgery. Preventive maintenance seems to be a good choice to identify the onset of an irreversible prosthesis failure. Considering all these aspects for hip implant monitoring, this paper explores existing studies linking ML models and intelligent systems for hip implant diagnosis. This paper explores the feasibility of an alternative continuous monitoring technique for post-surgery implant monitoring backed by an in vitro ML case study. Tribocorrosion and acoustic emission (AE) data are considered based on their efficacy in determining irreversible alteration of implant material to prevent total failures. This study also facilitates the relevance of developing an artificially intelligent implant monitoring methodology that can function with daily patient activities and how it can influence the digital orthopedic diagnosis.

36700903,Context Matters: A Qualitative Synthesis of Adherence Literature for People on Hemodialysis.,"Patients with ESKD treated with hemodialysis in the United States have persistently higher rates of nonadherence compared with patients in other developed countries. Nonadherence is associated with an increased risk of death and higher medical expenditure. There is an urgent need to address it with feasible, effective interventions as the prevalence of patients on hemodialysis in the United States continues to grow. However, published adherence interventions demonstrate limited long-term efficacy. We conducted a synthesis of qualitative studies on adherence to hemodialysis treatment, medications, and fluid and dietary restrictions to identify gaps in published adherence interventions, searching PubMed, CINAHL, PsychInfo, Embase, and Web of Science databases. We analyzed qualitative data with a priori codes derived from the World Health Organization's adherence framework and subsequent codes from thematic analysis. We screened 1775 articles and extracted qualitative data from 12. The qualitative data revealed 20 factors unique to hemodialysis across the World Health Organization's five dimensions of adherence. In addition, two overarching themes emerged from the data: (1) adherence in the context of patients' whole lives and (2) dialysis treatment as a double-edged sword. Patient-level factors reflected in the qualitative data extended beyond knowledge about hemodialysis treatment or motivation to adhere to treatment. Patients described a profound grieving process over the loss of their ""old self"" that impacted adherence. They also navigated complex challenges that could be exacerbated by social determinants of health as they balanced treatment, life tasks, and social roles. This review adds to the growing evidence that one-size-fits-all approaches to improving adherence among patients on hemodialysis are inadequate. Adherence may improve when routine care incorporates patient context and provides ongoing support to patients and families as they navigate the logistical, physical, and psychological hardships of living with dialysis. New research is urgently needed to guide a change in course.",Taylor KS; Umeukeje EM; Santos SR; McNabb KC; Crews DC; Hladek MD,Kidney360,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36700903/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36697862,Questioning the fetal microbiome illustrates pitfalls of low-biomass microbial studies.,"Whether the human fetus and the prenatal intrauterine environment (amniotic fluid and placenta) are stably colonized by microbial communities in a healthy pregnancy remains a subject of debate. Here we evaluate recent studies that characterized microbial populations in human fetuses from the perspectives of reproductive biology, microbial ecology, bioinformatics, immunology, clinical microbiology and gnotobiology, and assess possible mechanisms by which the fetus might interact with microorganisms. Our analysis indicates that the detected microbial signals are likely the result of contamination during the clinical procedures to obtain fetal samples or during DNA extraction and DNA sequencing. Furthermore, the existence of live and replicating microbial populations in healthy fetal tissues is not compatible with fundamental concepts of immunology, clinical microbiology and the derivation of germ-free mammals. These conclusions are important to our understanding of human immune development and illustrate common pitfalls in the microbial analyses of many other low-biomass environments. The pursuit of a fetal microbiome serves as a cautionary example of the challenges of sequence-based microbiome studies when biomass is low or absent, and emphasizes the need for a trans-disciplinary approach that goes beyond contamination controls by also incorporating biological, ecological and mechanistic concepts.",Kennedy KM; de Goffau MC; Perez-Muñoz ME; Arrieta MC; Bäckhed F; Bork P; Braun T; Bushman FD; Dore J; de Vos WM; Earl AM; Eisen JA; Elovitz MA; Ganal-Vonarburg SC; Gänzle MG; Garrett WS; Hall LJ; Hornef MW; Huttenhower C; Konnikova L; Lebeer S; Macpherson AJ; Massey RC; McHardy AC; Koren O; Lawley TD; Ley RE; O'Mahony L; O'Toole PW; Pamer EG; Parkhill J; Raes J; Rattei T; Salonen A; Segal E; Segata N; Shanahan F; Sloboda DM; Smith GCS; Sokol H; Spector TD; Surette MG; Tannock GW; Walker AW; Yassour M; Walter J,Nature,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36697862/,1,0,0,0,0,0

In order to monitor open science practices, they first need to be well defined and operationalized. To reach consensus on what open science practices to monitor at biomedical research institutions, we conducted a modified 3-round Delphi study. Participants were research administrators, researchers, specialists in dedicated open science roles, and librarians. In rounds 1 and 2, participants completed an online survey evaluating a set of potential open science practices, and for round 3, we hosted two half-day virtual meetings to discuss and vote on items that had not reached consensus. Ultimately, participants reached consensus on 19 open science practices.

Beginning with genome surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the development of omics technologies brought a clearer understanding of the complex SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. Here, we reviewed how omics, including genomics, proteomics, single-cell multi-omics, and clinical phenomics, play roles in answering biological and clinical questions about COVID-19. Large-scale sequencing and advanced analysis methods facilitate COVID-19 discovery from virus evolution and severity risk prediction to potential treatment identification. Omics would indicate precise and globalized prevention and medicine for the COVID-19 pandemic under the utilization of big data capability and phenotypes refinement.

Many of the current advances aim to improve the accuracy of differentiation between benign biliary strictures and cholangiocarcinoma, which include endoscopic techniques, devices, image processing, and the use of genomic sequencing in acquired specimens. In this review, the authors explore the historical timeline of changes leading to modern management of cholangiocarcinoma, with special emphasis on endoscopic modalities and novel therapeutic interventions. The authors also expand on the strengths and shortcomings of endoscopic diagnostics and techniques in biliary drainage and finally discuss potential areas to focus for future research and development. Despite the advances in diagnosis and management of cholangiocarcinoma, there remain multiple tasks that are still awaiting to be completed. Next-generation sequencing in the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma needs to be further tested, validated, and easily obtainable.

The computing field has allowed for the development of artificial intelligence (AI), which can mimic the neural network of the human brain. One use of this technology has been to help researchers capture hidden, high-dimensional images of brain tumors. These images can provide new insights into the nature of brain tumors and help to improve treatment options. AI and precision medicine (PM) are converging to revolutionize healthcare. AI has the potential to improve cancer imaging interpretation in several ways, including more accurate tumor genotyping, more precise delineation of tumor volume, and better prediction of clinical outcomes. AI-assisted brain surgery can be an effective and safe option for treating brain tumors. This review discusses various AI and PM techniques that can be used in brain tumor treatment. These new techniques for the treatment of brain tumors, i.e., genomic profiling, microRNA panels, quantitative imaging, and radiomics, hold great promise for the future. However, there are challenges that must be overcome for these technologies to reach their full potential and improve healthcare.",Philip AK; Samuel BA; Bhatia S; Khalifa SAM; El-Seedi HR,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36675973/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36646475,"Adverse maternal, fetal, and newborn outcomes among pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection: an individual participant data meta-analysis.","Despite a growing body of research on the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, there is continued controversy given heterogeneity in the quality and design of published studies. We screened ongoing studies in our sequential, prospective meta-analysis. We pooled individual participant data to estimate the absolute and relative risk (RR) of adverse outcomes among pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared with confirmed negative pregnancies. We evaluated the risk of bias using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We screened 137 studies and included 12 studies in 12 countries involving 13 136 pregnant women.Pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection-as compared with uninfected pregnant women-were at significantly increased risk of maternal mortality (10 studies; n=1490; RR 7.68, 95% CI 1.70 to 34.61); admission to intensive care unit (8 studies; n=6660; RR 3.81, 95% CI 2.03 to 7.17); receiving mechanical ventilation (7 studies; n=4887; RR 15.23, 95% CI 4.32 to 53.71); receiving any critical care (7 studies; n=4735; RR 5.48, 95% CI 2.57 to 11.72); and being diagnosed with pneumonia (6 studies; n=4573; RR 23.46, 95% CI 3.03 to 181.39) and thromboembolic disease (8 studies; n=5146; RR 5.50, 95% CI 1.12 to 27.12).Neonates born to women with SARS-CoV-2 infection were more likely to be admitted to a neonatal care unit after birth (7 studies; n=7637; RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.08); be born preterm (7 studies; n=6233; RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.29) or moderately preterm (7 studies; n=6071; RR 2.92, 95% CI 1.88 to 4.54); and to be born low birth weight (12 studies; n=11 930; RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.40). Infection was not linked to stillbirth. Studies were generally at low or moderate risk of bias.

Machine learning (ML) has proven to be very useful in the scientific community, especially in the health sector. With the aim of providing useful tools to help nutritionists and dieticians, research focused on the development of ML and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms and models is searched in the literature. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol has been used, a very common technique applied to carry out revisions. In our proposal, 17 articles have been filtered in which ML and DL are applied in the prediction of diseases, in the delineation of treatment strategies, in the improvement of personalized nutrition and more. Despite expecting better results with the use of DL, according to the selected investigations, the traditional methods are still the most used and the yields in both cases fluctuate around positive values, conditioned by the databases (transformed in each case) to a greater extent than by the artificial intelligence paradigm used.

Electronic databases and grey literature were searched for articles reporting the assessment of DALY and its components. We considered studies in which researchers performed DALY calculations using primary epidemiological data input sources. We screened 3053 studies of which 2948 were excluded and 105 studies met our inclusion criteria. Of these studies, 22 were multi-country and 83 were single-country studies, of which 46 were from the Netherlands. Food- and water-borne diseases were the most frequently studied infectious diseases. Between 2015 and 2022, the number of burden of infectious disease studies was 1.6 times higher compared to that published between 2000 and 2014. Almost all studies (97%) estimated DALYs based on the incidence- and pathogen-based approach and without social weighting functions; however, there was less methodological consensus with regards to the disability weights and life tables that were applied. The number of burden of infectious disease studies undertaken across Europe has increased over time.

Navigating and managing FA permeates across multiple facets of childhood. In this article, we review research on social disparities in feeding practices, managing meals, and selecting childcare and schools. Key highlights include the following: (1) although preference for breast-feeding or formula feeding does not reduce FA risk, there are disparities in access to formula that may affect children with FA; (2) disparities likely exist in the early introduction to allergenic foods, though additional research is needed to identify barriers to following the most recent consensus guidelines on early introduction; (3) families with limited income face challenges in providing safe meals for their children; (4) disparities exist in early childcare options for preschool-age children, though there is a lack of research on FA practices in these settings; and (5) there is evidence that schools with different student demographics implement different types of FA policies.

36598418,Association between seafood intake and the risk of thyroid cancer.,"<b></b><i>Background:</i> Previous observational epidemiological studies such as case-control studies and cohort studies have reported inconsistent results regarding the associations between seafood intake and the risk of thyroid cancer. <i>Materials and methods:</i> We searched PubMed and EMBASE in August 2021 using keywords related to seafood intake and thyroid cancer. A pooled odds ratio (OR) or relative risk (RR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. <i>Results:</i> We included 17 observational studies with 13 case-control studies and 4 cohort studies, which included 4,309 thyroid cancer patients among 599,161 participants. In the random effects model meta-analysis of all 17 studies, we found that there was no significant association between seafood intake (highest vs. lowest intake) and the risk of thyroid cancer (OR or RR, 1.01; 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.19; I<sup>2</sup>=51.4%). Although the associations were not statistically significant, subgroup meta-analyses by study design showed opposite findings: seafood intake decreased the risk of thyroid cancer in case-control studies (OR or RR, 0.94; 95% CI: 0.74 to 1.19; I<sup>2</sup>=60.6%; n=13) but increased in cohort studies (OR or RR, 1.14; 95% CI: 0.97 to 1.35; I<sup>2</sup>=0.0%; n=4). <i>Conclusion:</i> The current meta-analysis of observational epidemiological studies found that that overall, there was no significant association between seafood intake and the risk of thyroid cancer.

CompTox provides toxicity screening methods for drug discovery in the early stages. CompTox also contributes to fostering the application of the principles of the 3Rs in toxicity testing by expanding non-animal test methods. The mechanism of toxicity is complex and varied, and drug discovery modalities are becoming more diverse. Consequently, the research is considered necessary to predict toxicity using not only chemical structures but experimental data as well. Additionally, various perspectives, such as interpretation of toxicity mechanisms and species differences, must be considered in risk assessment and management in drug safety research. Therefore, it is important to construct a comprehensive CompTox system that not only presents toxicity prediction results but also provides much information related to the relationship between drug candidate substances and living organisms. In this review paper, CompTox is positioned as a discipline of toxicology that applies computer-based technology, including AI (artificial intelligence). I also introduce toxicity prediction systems based on experimental data and an ontology system that supports the interpretation of toxicity prediction results as examples of research on constructing the foundation of a comprehensive CompTox system.",Yamada H,Nihon yakurigaku zasshi.

In this Review, we discuss advances in our understanding of EED, intestinal adaptation and the gut microbiome over the 'first 1,000 days' of life, spanning pregnancy and early childhood. Data on maternal EED are emerging, and they mirror earlier findings of increased risks for preterm birth and fetal growth restriction in mothers with either active inflammatory bowel disease or coeliac disease. The intense metabolic demands of pregnancy and lactation drive gut adaptation, including dramatic changes in the composition, function and mother-to-child transmission of the gut microbiota.

To tackle malnutrition and related conditions in Malaysia, research in the new and evolving field of nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics is essential. As part of the Gene-Nutrient Interactions (GeNuIne) Collaboration, the Nutrigenetics and Nutrigenomics Research and Training Unit (N<sup>2</sup>RTU) aims to solve the malnutrition paradox. This review discusses and presents a conceptual framework that shows the pathway to implementing and strengthening precision nutrition strategies in Malaysia. The framework is divided into: (1) Research and (2) Training and Resource Development.

36498053,Exploring the Role of Sclerostin as a Biomarker of Cardiovascular Disease and Mortality: A Scoping Review.,"Sclerostin is most recognized for its role in controlling bone formation; however, it is also expressed in the heart, aorta, coronary, and peripheral arteries. Human studies have associated high circulating sclerostin levels with the presence of different cardiovascular diseases (CVD), surrogate CVD markers, and a high risk of cardiovascular events in some populations. However, this is still a matter of scientific debate, as the results have been very heterogeneous among studies. In the present review, the association between serum sclerostin levels and CVD and/or cardiovascular mortality was analyzed. For this purpose, a scoping review was performed in which articles measuring serum sclerostin levels and cardiovascular risk in patients were selected. Eleven articles answered the research question; of these articles, 8/11 evaluated the association between sclerostin and CVD, of which 4/8 found a positive association, 2/8 found a negative association, and 2/8 found no association between variables. Five (5/11) of the articles included in the study evaluated cardiovascular mortality, of which 3/5 found a positive association, 1/5 found a negative association, and 1/5 found no association between variables. In conclusion, we did not find sufficient results to be able to demonstrate an association between elevated sclerostin levels and the development of CVD and/or cardiovascular mortality in the general population due to heterogeneity in the results. However, there seems to be a tendency to consider increased sclerostin levels as a risk factor for both the development of cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality in specific populations. Further studies in this field will help to solve some of the inconsistencies found during this scoping review and allow for the future use of sclerostin measurement as a strategy in the prevention and diagnosis of CVD and/or cardiovascular mortality.",Sanabria-de la Torre R; González-Salvatierra S; García-Fontana C; Andújar-Vera F; García-Fontana B; Muñoz-Torres M; Riquelme-Gallego B,International journal of environmental research and public health,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36498053/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36461323,Exploring the role of green and Industry 4.0 technologies in achieving sustainable development goals in food sectors.,"In recent years, the rapid increase in the global population, the challenges associated with climate change, and the emergence of new pandemics have all become major threats to food security worldwide. Consequently, innovative solutions are urgently needed to address the current challenges and enhance food sustainability. Green technologies have gained significant attention for many food applications, while the technologies of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) are reshaping different production and consumption sectors, such as food and agriculture. In this review, a general overview of green and Industry 4.0 technologies from a food perspective will be provided. Connections between green food technologies (e.g., green preservation, processing, extraction, and analysis) and Industry 4.0 enablers (e.g., artificial intelligence, big data, smart sensors, robotics, blockchain, and the Internet of Things) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be identified and explained. Green and Industry 4.0 technologies are both rapidly becoming a valuable part of meeting the SDGs. These technologies demonstrate high potential to foster ecological and digital transitions of food systems, delivering societal, economic, and environmental outcomes. A range of green technologies has already provided innovative solutions for major food system transformations, while the application of digital technologies and other Industry 4.0 technological innovations is still limited in the food sector. It is therefore expected that more green and digital solutions will be adopted in the coming years, harnessing their full potential to achieve a healthier, smarter, more sustainable and more resilient food future.",Hassoun A; Prieto MA; Carpena M; Bouzembrak Y; Marvin HJP; Pallarés N; Barba FJ; Punia Bangar S; Chaudhary V; Ibrahim S; Bono G,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36461323/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36458297,The promise of the metaverse in mental health: the new era of MEDverse.,"Since Mark Zuckerberg's announcement about the development of new three-dimensional virtual worlds for social communication, a great debate has been raised about the promise of such a technology. The metaverse, a term formed by combining meta and universe, could open a new era in mental health, mainly in psychological disorders, where the creation of a full-body illusion <i>via digital avatar</i> could promote healthcare and personal well-being. Patients affected by body dysmorphism symptoms (i.e., eating disorders), social deficits (i.e. autism) could greatly benefit from this kind of technology. However, it is not clear which advantage the metaverse would have in treating psychological disorders with respect to the well-known and effective virtual reality (VR) exposure therapy. Indeed, in the last twenty years, a plethora of studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of VR technology in reducing symptoms of pain, anxiety, stress, as well as, in improving cognitive and social skills. We hypothesize that the metaverse will offer more opportunities, such as a more complex, virtual realm where sensory inputs, and recurrent feedback, mediated by a ""federation"" of multiple technologies - e.g., artificial intelligence, tangible interfaces, Internet of Things and blockchain, can be reinterpreted for facilitating a new kind of communication overcoming self-body representation. However, nowadays a clear starting point does not exist. For this reason, it is worth defining a theoretical framework for applying this new kind of technology in a social neuroscience context for developing accurate solutions to mental health in the future.",Cerasa A; Gaggioli A; Marino F; Riva G; Pioggia G,Heliyon,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36458297/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36446275,A perfect fit: Bacteriophage receptor-binding proteins for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.,"Bacteriophages are the most abundant biological entity on earth, acting as the predators and evolutionary drivers of bacteria. Owing to their inherent ability to specifically infect and kill bacteria, phages and their encoded endolysins and receptor-binding proteins (RBPs) have enormous potential for development into precision antimicrobials for treatment of bacterial infections and microbial disbalances; or as biocontrol agents to tackle bacterial contaminations during various biotechnological processes. The extraordinary binding specificity of phages and RBPs can be exploited in various areas of bacterial diagnostics and monitoring, from food production to health care. We review and describe the distinctive features of phage RBPs, explain why they are attractive candidates for use as therapeutics and in diagnostics, discuss recent applications using RBPs, and finally provide our perspective on how synthetic technology and artificial intelligence-driven approaches will revolutionize how we use these tools in the future.",Klumpp J; Dunne M; Loessner MJ,Current opinion in microbiology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36446275/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36437004,Timing of Food/Nutrient Intake and Its Health Benefits.,"Growing evidence from animal and human research indicates the importance of homeostatic regulation of the circadian clock in the body. Dysfunction of the circadian clock caused by jet lag or night-shift work increases the risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Thus, it is important to consider the circadian clock function for prevention of these diseases. Chrono-nutrition is a recently established research field that examines the relationship between the timing of food/nutrition and health. It is well known that breakfast skipping and late-night meals are independent risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Chrono-nutrition also advocates research on nutrition and the biological clock and the social implementation of the research. Breakfast can advance the phase of the peripheral clock, but late dinner can delay it. Moreover, many functional foods and nutrients, such as caffeine and polyphenols, regulate the circadian clock. In this review, we discuss how diet/nutrition entrains the peripheral clock and the relationship between meal timing and health outcomes. In addition, the effects of time-restricted feeding/eating on metabolism and related diseases are discussed. Lastly, we introduce ""personalized chrono-nutrition,"" that uses recent progress of technology such as sensors and the artificial intelligence/internet of things (AI/IOT) to promote personalized chrono-nutritional suggestions and health systems.",Takahashi M; Tahara Y,Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36437004/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36432533,Capturing Eating Behavior from Video Analysis: A Systematic Review.,"Current methods to detect eating behavior events (i.e., bites, chews, and swallows) lack objective measurements, standard procedures, and automation. The video recordings of eating episodes provide a non-invasive and scalable source for automation. Here, we reviewed the current methods to automatically detect eating behavior events from video recordings. According to PRISMA guidelines, publications from 2010-2021 in PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar were screened through title and abstract, leading to the identification of 277 publications. We screened the full text of 52 publications and included 13 for analysis. We classified the methods in five distinct categories based on their similarities and analyzed their accuracy. Facial landmarks can count bites, chews, and food liking automatically (accuracy: 90%, 60%, 25%). Deep neural networks can detect bites and gesture intake (accuracy: 91%, 86%). The active appearance model can detect chewing (accuracy: 93%), and optical flow can count chews (accuracy: 88%). Video fluoroscopy can track swallows but is currently not suitable beyond clinical settings. The optimal method for automated counts of bites and chews is facial landmarks, although further improvements are required. Future methods should accurately predict bites, chews, and swallows using inexpensive hardware and limited computational capacity. Automatic eating behavior analysis will allow the study of eating behavior and real-time interventions to promote healthy eating behaviors.",Tufano M; Lasschuijt M; Chauhan A; Feskens EJM; Camps G,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36432533/,0,1,0,0,0,0
36432497,"Prediction, Discovery, and Characterization of Plant- and Food-Derived Health-Beneficial Bioactive Peptides.","Nature may have the answer to many of our questions about human, animal, and environmental health. Natural bioactives, especially when harvested from sustainable plant and food sources, provide a plethora of molecular solutions to nutritionally actionable, chronic conditions. The spectrum of these conditions, such as metabolic, immune, and gastrointestinal disorders, has changed with prolonged human life span, which should be matched with an appropriately extended health span, which would in turn favour more sustainable health care: ""adding years to life and adding life to years"". To date, bioactive peptides have been undervalued and underexploited as food ingredients and drugs. The future of translational science on bioactive peptides-and natural bioactives in general-is being built on (a) systems-level rather than reductionist strategies for understanding their interdependent, and at times synergistic, functions; and (b) the leverage of artificial intelligence for prediction and discovery, thereby significantly reducing the time from idea and concept to finished solutions for consumers and patients.

36428686,Artificial Intelligence for Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment of Prostate Cancer.,"As medical science and technology progress towards the era of ""big data"", a multi-dimensional dataset pertaining to medical diagnosis and treatment is becoming accessible for mathematical modelling. However, these datasets are frequently inconsistent, noisy, and often characterized by a significant degree of redundancy. Thus, extensive data processing is widely advised to clean the dataset before feeding it into the mathematical model. In this context, Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) and their types, are being used to produce a precise and cross-sectional illustration of clinical data. For prostate cancer patients, datasets derived from the prostate-specific antigen (PSA), MRI-guided biopsies, genetic biomarkers, and the Gleason grading are primarily used for diagnosis, risk stratification, and patient monitoring. However, recording diagnoses and further stratifying risks based on such diagnostic data frequently involves much subjectivity. Thus, implementing an AI algorithm on a PC's diagnostic data can reduce the subjectivity of the process and assist in decision making. In addition, AI is used to cut down the processing time and help with early detection, which provides a superior outcome in critical cases of prostate cancer. Furthermore, this also facilitates offering the service at a lower cost by reducing the amount of human labor. Herein, the prime objective of this review is to provide a deep analysis encompassing the existing AI algorithms that are being deployed in the field of prostate cancer (PC) for diagnosis and treatment. Based on the available literature, AI-powered technology has the potential for extensive growth and penetration in PC diagnosis and treatment to ease and expedite the existing medical process.",Rabaan AA; Bakhrebah MA; AlSaihati H; Alhumaid S; Alsubki RA; Turkistani SA; Al-Abdulhadi S; Aldawood Y; Alsaleh AA; Alhashem YN; Almatouq JA; Alqatari AA; Alahmed HE; Sharbini DA; Alahmadi AF; Alsalman F; Alsayyah A; Mutair AA,Cancers,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36428686/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36425597,Emerging trends in the agri-food sector: Digitalisation and shift to plant-based diets.,"Our planet is currently facing unprecedented interconnected environmental, societal, and economic dilemmas due to climate change, the outbreak of pandemics and wars, among others. These global challenges pose direct threats to food security and safety and clearly show the urgent need for innovative scientific solutions and technological approaches. Backed by the current alarming situation, many food-related trends have emerged in recent years in response to these global issues. This review looks at two megatrends in agriculture and the food industry; the shift to vegetable diets and the digital transformation in food production and consumption patterns. On one side, several innovative technologies and protein sources have been associated with more sustainable food systems and enhanced nutritional quality and safety. On the other side, many digital advanced technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, big data, the Internet of Things, blockchain, and 3D printing) have been increasingly applied in smart farms and smart food factories to improve food system outcomes. Increasing adoption of vegetal innovations and harnessing Industry 4.0 technologies along the food supply chain have the potential to enable efficient digital and ecological transitions.",Hassoun A; Boukid F; Pasqualone A; Bryant CJ; García GG; Parra-López C; Jagtap S; Trollman H; Cropotova J; Barba FJ,Current research in food science,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36425597/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36424825,Cardiovascular Effects of Environmental Metal Antimony: Redox Dyshomeostasis as the Key Pathogenic Driver.,"<b><i>Significance:</i></b> Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide, which may be due to sedentary lifestyles with less physical activity and over nutrition as well as an increase in the aging population; however, the contribution of pollutants, environmental chemicals, and nonessential metals to the increased and persistent CVDs needs more attention and investigation. Among environmental contaminant nonessential metals, antimony has been less addressed. <b><i>Recent Advances:</i></b> Among environmental contaminant nonessential metals, several metals such as lead, arsenic, and cadmium have been associated with the increased risk of CVDs. Antimony has been less addressed, but its potential link to CVDs is being gradually recognized. <b><i>Critical Issues:</i></b> Several epidemiological studies have revealed the significant deleterious effects of antimony on the cardiovascular system in the absence or presence of other nonessential metals. There has been less focus on whether antimony alone can contribute to the pathogenesis of CVDs and the proposed mechanisms of such possible effects. This review addresses this gap in knowledge by presenting the current available evidence that highlights the potential role of antimony in the pathogenesis of CVDs, most likely <i>via</i> antimony-mediated redox dyshomeostasis. <b><i>Future Directions:</i></b> More direct evidence from preclinical and mechanistic studies is urgently needed to evaluate the possible roles of antimony in mitochondrial dysfunction and epigenetic regulation in CVDs. <i>Antioxid.

36409321,Chardonnay Marc as a New Model for Upcycled Co-products in the Food Industry: Concentration of Diverse Natural Products Chemistry for Consumer Health and Sensory Benefits.,"Research continues to provide compelling insights into potential health benefits associated with diets rich in plant-based natural products (PBNPs). Coupled with evidence from dietary intervention trials, dietary recommendations increasingly include higher intakes of PBNPs. In addition to health benefits, PBNPs can drive flavor and sensory perceptions in foods and beverages. Chardonnay marc (pomace) is a byproduct of winemaking obtained after fruit pressing that has not undergone fermentation. Recent research has revealed that PBNP diversity within Chardonnay marc has potential relevance to human health and desirable sensory attributes in food and beverage products. This review explores the potential of Chardonnay marc as a valuable new PBNP ingredient in the food system by combining health, sensory, and environmental sustainability benefits that serves as a model for development of future ingredients within a sustainable circular bioeconomy. This includes a discussion on the potential role of computational methods, including artificial intelligence (AI), in accelerating research and development required to discover and commercialize this new source of PBNPs.",Holt RR; Barile D; Wang SC; Munafo JP; Arvik T; Li X; Lee F; Keen CL; Tagkopoulos I; Schmitz HH,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36409321/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36408681,When a birth cohort grows up: challenges and opportunities in longitudinal developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) research.,"High-quality evidence from prospective longitudinal studies in humans is essential to testing hypotheses related to the developmental origins of health and disease. In this paper, the authors draw upon their own experiences leading birth cohorts with longitudinal follow-up into adulthood to describe specific challenges and lessons learned. Challenges are substantial and grow over time. Long-term funding is essential for study operations and critical to retaining study staff, who develop relationships with participants and hold important institutional knowledge and technical skill sets. To maintain contact, we recommend that cohorts apply multiple strategies for tracking and obtain as much high-quality contact information as possible before the child's 18<sup>th</sup> birthday. To maximize engagement, we suggest that cohorts offer flexibility in visit timing, length, location, frequency, and type. Data collection may entail multiple modalities, even at a single collection timepoint, including measures that are self-reported, research-measured, and administrative with a mix of remote and in-person collection. Many topics highly relevant for adolescent and young adult health and well-being are considered to be private in nature, and their assessment requires sensitivity. To motivate ongoing participation, cohorts must work to understand participant barriers and motivators, share scientific findings, and provide appropriate compensation for participation. It is essential for cohorts to strive for broad representation including individuals from higher risk populations, not only among the participants but also the staff. Successful longitudinal follow-up of a study population ultimately requires flexibility, adaptability, appropriate incentives, and opportunities for feedback from participants.",Oken E; Bastain TM; Bornkamp N; Breton CV; Fry RC; Gold DR; Hivert MF; Howland S; Jackson DJ; Johnson CC; Jones K; Killingbeck M; O'Shea TM; Ortega M; Ownby D; Perera F; Rollins JV; Herbstman JB,Journal of developmental origins of health and disease,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36408681/,1,0,0,0,0,1
36377578,A systematic review of breast milk microbiota composition and the evidence for transfer to and colonisation of the infant gut.,"The intestinal microbiota plays a major role in infant health and development. However, the role of the breastmilk microbiota in infant gut colonisation remains unclear. A systematic review was performed to evaluate the composition of the breastmilk microbiota and evidence for transfer to/colonisation of the infant gut. Searches were performed using PUBMED, OVID, LILACS and PROQUEST from inception until 18th March 2020 with a PUBMED update to December 2021. 88 full texts were evaluated before final critique based on study power, sample contamination avoidance, storage, purification process, DNA extraction/analysis, and consideration of maternal health and other potential confounders. Risk of skin contamination was reduced mainly by breast cleaning and rejecting the first milk drops. Sample storage, DNA extraction and bioinformatics varied. Several studies stored samples under conditions that may selectively impact bacterial DNA preservation, others used preculture reducing reliability. Only 15 studies, with acceptable sample size, handling, extraction, and bacterial analysis, considered transfer of bacteria to the infant. Three reported bacterial transfer from infant to breastmilk. Despite consistent evidence for the breastmilk microbiota, and recent studies using improved methods to investigate factors affecting its composition, few studies adequately considered transfer to the infant gut providing very little evidence for effective impact on gut colonisation.",Edwards CA; Van Loo-Bouwman CA; Van Diepen JA; Schoemaker MH; Ozanne SE; Venema K; Stanton C; Marinello V; Rueda R; Flourakis M; Gil A; Van der Beek EM,Beneficial microbes,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36377578/,0,1,0,0,0,0
36364922,Novel Therapeutic Approaches for Mitigating Complications in Short Bowel Syndrome.,"Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a particularly serious condition in which the small intestine does not absorb sufficient nutrients for biological needs, resulting in severe illness and potentially death if not treated. Given the important role of the gut in many signaling cascades throughout the body, SBS results in disruption of many pathways and imbalances in various hormones. Due to the inability to meet sufficient nutritional needs, an intravenous form of nutrition, total parental nutrition (TPN), is administered. However, TPN presents difficulties such as severe liver injury and altered signaling secondary to the continued lack of luminal contents. This manuscript aims to summarize relevant studies into the systemic effects of TPN on systems such as the gut-brain, gut-lung, and gut-liver axis, as well as present novel therapeutics currently under use or investigation as mitigation strategies for TPN induced injury.",Bettag J; Po L; Cunningham C; Tallam R; Kurashima K; Nagarapu A; Hutchinson C; Morfin S; Nazzal M; Lin CJ; Mathur A; Aurora R; Jain AK,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36364922/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36359807,The Adverse Outcome Pathway Framework Applied to Neurological Symptoms of COVID-19.,"Several reports have shown that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has the potential to also be neurotropic. However, the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 induces neurologic injury, including neurological and/or psychological symptoms, remain unclear. In this review, the available knowledge on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying COVID-19 was organized using the AOP framework. Four AOPs leading to neurological adverse outcomes (AO), anosmia, encephalitis, stroke, and seizure, were developed. Biological key events (KEs) identified to induce these AOs included binding to ACE2, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, hypoxia, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. The modularity of AOPs allows the construction of AOP networks to visualize core pathways and recognize neuroinflammation and BBB disruption as shared mechanisms. Furthermore, the impact on the neurological AOPs of COVID-19 by modulating and multiscale factors such as age, psychological stress, nutrition, poverty, and food insecurity was discussed. Organizing the existing knowledge along an AOP framework can represent a valuable tool to understand disease mechanisms and identify data gaps and potentially contribute to treatment, and prevention. This AOP-aligned approach also facilitates synergy between experts from different backgrounds, while the fast-evolving and disruptive nature of COVID-19 emphasizes the need for interdisciplinarity and cross-community research.",Hogberg HT; Lam A; Ohayon E; Shahbaz MA; Clerbaux LA; Bal-Price A; Coecke S; Concha R; De Bernardi F; Edrosa E; Hargreaves AJ; Kanninen KM; Munoz A; Pistollato F; Saravanan S; Garcia-Reyero N; Wittwehr C; Sachana M,Cells,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36359807/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36353677,Single-cell technologies: From research to application.,"In recent years, more and more single-cell technologies have been developed. A vast amount of single-cell omics data has been generated by large projects, such as the Human Cell Atlas, the Mouse Cell Atlas, the Mouse RNA Atlas, the Mouse ATAC Atlas, and the Plant Cell Atlas. Based on these single-cell big data, thousands of bioinformatics algorithms for quality control, clustering, cell-type annotation, developmental inference, cell-cell transition, cell-cell interaction, and spatial analysis are developed. With powerful experimental single-cell technology and state-of-the-art big data analysis methods based on artificial intelligence, the molecular landscape at the single-cell level can be revealed. With spatial transcriptomics and single-cell multi-omics, even the spatial dynamic multi-level regulatory mechanisms can be deciphered. Such single-cell technologies have many successful applications in oncology, assisted reproduction, embryonic development, and plant breeding. We not only review the experimental and bioinformatics methods for single-cell research, but also discuss their applications in various fields and forecast the future directions for single-cell technologies. We believe that spatial transcriptomics and single-cell multi-omics will become the next booming business for mechanism research and commercial industry.",Wen L; Li G; Huang T; Geng W; Pei H; Yang J; Zhu M; Zhang P; Hou R; Tian G; Su W; Chen J; Zhang D; Zhu P; Zhang W; Zhang X; Zhang N; Zhao Y; Cao X; Peng G; Ren X; Jiang N; Tian C; Chen ZJ,Innovation (Cambridge (Mass.)),2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36353677/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36350048,Effect of computer-aided colonoscopy on adenoma miss rates and polyp detection: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Multiple computer-aided techniques utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) have been created to improve the detection of polyps during colonoscopy and thereby reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer. While adenoma detection rates (ADR) and polyp detection rates (PDR) are important colonoscopy quality indicators, adenoma miss rates (AMR) may better quantify missed lesions, which can ultimately lead to interval colorectal cancer. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the efficacy of computer-aided colonoscopy (CAC) with respect to AMR, ADR, and PDR in randomized controlled trials. A comprehensive, systematic literature search was performed across multiple databases in September of 2022 to identify randomized, controlled trials that compared CAC with traditional colonoscopy. Primary outcomes were AMR, ADR, and PDR. Fourteen studies totaling 10 928 patients were included in the final analysis. There was a 65% reduction in the adenoma miss rate with CAC (OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.25-0.49, P < 0.001, I<sup>2</sup>  = 50%). There was a 78% reduction in the sessile serrated lesion miss rate with CAC (OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.08-0.65, P < 0.01, I<sup>2</sup>  = 0%). There was a 52% increase in ADR in the CAC group compared with the control group (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.39-1.67, P = 0.04, I<sup>2</sup>  = 47%). There was 93% increase in the number of adenomas > 10 mm detected per colonoscopy with CAC (OR 1.93; 95% CI, 1.18-3.16, P < 0.01, I<sup>2</sup>  = 0%). The results of the present study demonstrate the promise of CAC in improving AMR, ADR, PDR across a spectrum of size and morphological lesion characteristics.",Shah S; Park N; Chehade NEH; Chahine A; Monachese M; Tiritilli A; Moosvi Z; Ortizo R; Samarasena J,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36350048/,0,1,0,1,0,0
36328668,Temporal deep learning framework for retinopathy prediction in patients with type 1 diabetes.,"The adoption of electronic health records in hospitals has ensured the availability of large datasets that can be used to predict medical complications. The trajectories of patients in real-world settings are highly variable, making longitudinal data modeling challenging. In recent years, significant progress has been made in the study of deep learning models applied to time series; however, the application of these models to irregular medical time series (IMTS) remains limited. To address this issue, we developed a generic deep-learning-based framework for modeling IMTS that facilitates the comparative studies of sequential neural networks (transformers and long short-term memory) and irregular time representation techniques. A validation study to predict retinopathy complications was conducted on 1207 patients with type 1 diabetes in a French database using their historical glycosylated hemoglobin measurements, without any data aggregation or imputation. The transformer-based model combined with the soft one-hot representation of time gaps achieved the highest score: an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 88.65%, specificity of 85.56%, sensitivity of 83.33% and an improvement of 11.7% over the same architecture without time information. This is the first attempt to predict retinopathy complications in patients with type 1 diabetes using deep learning and longitudinal data collected from patient visits. This study highlighted the significance of modeling time gaps between medical records to improve prediction performance and the utility of a generic framework for conducting extensive comparative studies.",Rabhi S; Blanchard F; Diallo AM; Zeghlache D; Lukas C; Berot A; Delemer B; Barraud S,Artificial intelligence in medicine,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36328668/,1,0,0,0,0,1
36326993,Crohn's disease related strictures in cross-sectional imaging: More than meets the eye?,"Strictures in Crohn's disease (CD) are a hallmark of long-standing intestinal damage, brought about by inflammatory and non-inflammatory pathways. Understanding the complex pathophysiology related to inflammatory infiltrates, extracellular matrix deposition, as well as muscular hyperplasia is crucial to produce high-quality scoring indices for assessing CD strictures. In addition, cross-sectional imaging modalities are the primary tool for diagnosis and follow-up of strictures, especially with the initiation of anti-fibrotic therapy clinical trials. This in turn requires such modalities to both diagnose strictures with high accuracy, as well as be able to delineate the impact of each histomorphologic component on the individual stricture. We discuss the current knowledge on cross-sectional imaging modalities used for stricturing CD, with an emphasis on histomorphologic correlates, novel imaging parameters which may improve segregation between inflammatory, muscular, and fibrotic stricture components, as well as a future outlook on the role of artificial intelligence in this field of gastroenterology.",Sleiman J; Chirra P; Gandhi NS; Baker ME; Lu C; Gordon IO; Viswanath SE; Rieder F,United European gastroenterology journal,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36326993/,1,0,0,0,0,1
36321132,Non-coding RNAs and glioma: Focus on cancer stem cells.,"Glioblastoma and gliomas can have a wide range of histopathologic subtypes. These heterogeneous histologic phenotypes originate from tumor cells with the distinct functions of tumorigenesis and self-renewal, called glioma stem cells (GSCs). GSCs are characterized based on multi-layered epigenetic mechanisms, which control the expression of many genes. This epigenetic regulatory mechanism is often based on functional non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). ncRNAs have become increasingly important in the pathogenesis of human cancer and work as oncogenes or tumor suppressors to regulate carcinogenesis and progression. These RNAs by being involved in chromatin remodeling and modification, transcriptional regulation, and alternative splicing of pre-mRNA, as well as mRNA stability and protein translation, play a key role in tumor development and progression. Numerous studies have been performed to try to understand the dysregulation pattern of these ncRNAs in tumors and cancer stem cells (CSCs), which show robust differentiation and self-regeneration capacity. This review provides recent findings on the role of ncRNAs in glioma development and progression, particularly their effects on CSCs, thus accelerating the clinical implementation of ncRNAs as promising tumor biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",Rajabi A; Kayedi M; Rahimi S; Dashti F; Mirazimi SMA; Homayoonfal M; Mahdian SMA; Hamblin MR; Tamtaji OR; Afrasiabi A; Jafari A; Mirzaei H,Molecular therapy oncolytics,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36321132/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36297084,Proteomics Characterization of Food-Derived Bioactive Peptides with Anti-Allergic and Anti-Inflammatory Properties.,"Bioactive peptides are found in foods and dietary supplements and are responsible for health benefits with applications in human and animal medicine. The health benefits include antihypertensive, antimicrobial, antithrombotic, immunomodulatory, opioid, antioxidant, anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory functions. Bioactive peptides can be obtained by microbial action, mainly by the gastrointestinal microbiota from proteins present in food, originating from either vegetable or animal matter or by the action of different gastrointestinal proteases. Proteomics can play an important role in the identification of bioactive peptides. High-resolution mass spectrometry is the principal technique used to detect and identify different types of analytes present in complex mixtures, even when available at low concentrations. Moreover, proteomics may provide the characterization of epitopes to develop new food allergy vaccines and the use of immunomodulating peptides to induce oral tolerance toward offending food allergens or even to prevent allergic sensitization. In addition, food-derived bioactive peptides have been investigated for their anti-inflammatory properties to provide safer alternatives to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). All these bioactive peptides can be a potential source of novel drugs and ingredients in food and pharmaceuticals. The following review is focused on food-derived bioactive peptides with antiallergic and anti-inflammatory properties and summarizes the new insights into the use of proteomics for their identification and quantification.",Abril AG; Pazos M; Villa TG; Calo-Mata P; Barros-Velázquez J; Carrera M,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36297084/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36296388,"Advances in Fungal Phenaloenones-Natural Metabolites with Great Promise: Biosynthesis, Bioactivities, and an In Silico Evaluation of Their Potential as Human Glucose Transporter 1 Inhibitors.","Phenaloenones are structurally unique aromatic polyketides that have been reported in both microbial and plant sources. They possess a hydroxy perinaphthenone three-fused-ring system and exhibit diverse bioactivities, such as cytotoxic, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-HIV properties, and tyrosinase, α-glucosidase, lipase, AchE (acetylcholinesterase), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1, angiotensin-I-converting enzyme, and tyrosine phosphatase inhibition. Moreover, they have a rich nucleophilic nucleus that has inspired many chemists and biologists to synthesize more of these related derivatives. The current review provides an overview of the reported phenalenones with a fungal origin, including their structures, sources, biosynthesis, and bioactivities. Moreover, more than 135 metabolites have been listed, and 71 references have been cited. SuperPred, an artificial intelligence (AI) webserver, was used to predict the potential targets for selected phenalenones. Among these targets, we chose human glucose transporter 1 (hGLUT1) for an extensive in silico study, as it shows high probability and model accuracy. Among them, aspergillussanones C (60) and G (60) possessed the highest negative docking scores of -15.082 and -14.829 kcal/mol, respectively, compared to the native inhibitor of 5RE (score: -11.206 kcal/mol). The MD (molecular dynamics) simulation revealed their stability in complexes with GLUT1 at 100 ns. The virtual screening study results open up a new therapeutic approach by using some phenalenones as hGLUT1 inhibitors, which might be a potential target for cancer therapy.",Ibrahim SRM; Omar AM; Muhammad YA; Alqarni AA; Alshehri AM; Mohamed SGA; Abdallah HM; Elfaky MA; Mohamed GA; Xiao J,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36296388/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36295946,Role of Drone Technology Helping in Alleviating the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a new coronavirus, has affected economic and social standards as governments and healthcare regulatory agencies throughout the world expressed worry and explored harsh preventative measures to counteract the disease's spread and intensity. Several academics and experts are primarily concerned with halting the continuous spread of the unique virus. Social separation, the closing of borders, the avoidance of big gatherings, contactless transit, and quarantine are important methods. Multiple nations employ autonomous, digital, wireless, and other promising technologies to tackle this coronary pneumonia. This research examines a number of potential technologies, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, deep learning (DL), the Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing, and virtual reality (VR), in an effort to mitigate the danger of COVID-19. Due to their ability to transport food and medical supplies to a specific location, UAVs are currently being utilized as an innovative method to combat this illness. This research intends to examine the possibilities of UAVs in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic from several angles. UAVs offer intriguing options for delivering medical supplies, spraying disinfectants, broadcasting communications, conducting surveillance, inspecting, and screening patients for infection. This article examines the use of drones in healthcare as well as the advantages and disadvantages of strict adoption. Finally, challenges, opportunities, and future work are discussed to assist in adopting drone technology to tackle COVID-19-like diseases.",Mohsan SAH; Zahra QUA; Khan MA; Alsharif MH; Elhaty IA; Jahid A,Micromachines,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36295946/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Different from virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), the metaverse has a service-oriented solid model with an emphasis on social and content dimensions. It has widely been demonstrated that motor or cognitive deficits can be more effectively treated using VR/AR tools, but there are several issues that limit the real potential of immersive technologies applied to neurological patients. In this scoping review, we propose future research directions for applying technologies extracted from the metaverse in clinical neurorehabilitation. The multisensorial properties of the metaverse will boost the embodied cognition experience, thus influencing the internal body representations as well as learning strategies. Moreover, the immersive social environment shared with other patients will contribute to recovering social and psychoemotional abilities. In addition to the many potential pros, we will also discuss the cons, providing readers with the available information to better understand the complexity and limitations of the metaverse, which could be considered the future of neurorehabilitation.",Calabrò RS; Cerasa A; Ciancarelli I; Pignolo L; Tonin P; Iosa M; Morone G,Biomedicines,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36289862/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36270290,Multiple Facets of Cellular Homeostasis and Regeneration of the Mammalian Liver.,"Liver regeneration occurs in response to diverse injuries and is capable of functionally reestablishing the lost parenchyma. This phenomenon has been known since antiquity, encapsulated in the Greek myth where Prometheus was to be punished by Zeus for sharing the gift of fire with humanity by having an eagle eat his liver daily, only to have the liver regrow back, thus ensuring eternal suffering and punishment. Today, this process is actively leveraged clinically during living donor liver transplantation whereby up to a two-thirds hepatectomy (resection or removal of part of the liver) on a donor is used for transplant to a recipient. The donor liver rapidly regenerates to recover the lost parenchymal mass to form a functional tissue. This astonishing regenerative process and unique capacity of the liver are examined in further detail in this review.",Huppert SS; Schwartz RE,Annual review of physiology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36270290/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36249249,On AI Approaches for Promoting Maternal and Neonatal Health in Low Resource Settings: A Review.,"A significant challenge for hospitals and medical practitioners in low- and middle-income nations is the lack of sufficient health care facilities for timely medical diagnosis of chronic and deadly diseases. Particularly, maternal and neonatal morbidity due to various non-communicable and nutrition related diseases is a serious public health issue that leads to several deaths every year. These diseases affecting either mother or child can be hospital-acquired, contracted during pregnancy or delivery, postpartum and even during child growth and development. Many of these conditions are challenging to detect at their early stages, which puts the patient at risk of developing severe conditions over time. Therefore, there is a need for early screening, detection and diagnosis, which could reduce maternal and neonatal mortality. With the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI), digital technologies have emerged as practical assistive tools in different healthcare sectors but are still in their nascent stages when applied to maternal and neonatal health. This review article presents an in-depth examination of digital solutions proposed for maternal and neonatal healthcare in low resource settings and discusses the open problems as well as future research directions.",Khan M; Khurshid M; Vatsa M; Singh R; Duggal M; Singh K,Frontiers in public health,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36249249/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36240095,Contribution of Common Genetic Variants to Risk of Early-Onset Ischemic Stroke.,"Current genome-wide association studies of ischemic stroke have focused primarily on late-onset disease. As a complement to these studies, we sought to identify the contribution of common genetic variants to risk of early-onset ischemic stroke. We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of early-onset stroke (EOS), ages 18-59 years, using individual-level data or summary statistics in 16,730 cases and 599,237 nonstroke controls obtained across 48 different studies. We further compared effect sizes at associated loci between EOS and late-onset stroke (LOS) and compared polygenic risk scores (PRS) for venous thromboembolism (VTE) between EOS and LOS. We observed genome-wide significant associations of EOS with 2 variants in <i>ABO</i>, a known stroke locus. These variants tag blood subgroups O1 and A1, and the effect sizes of both variants were significantly larger in EOS compared with LOS. The odds ratio (OR) for rs529565, tagging O1, was 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-0.91) in EOS vs 0.96 (95% CI: 0.92-1.00) in LOS, and the OR for rs635634, tagging A1, was 1.16 (1.11-1.21) for EOS vs 1.05 (0.99-1.11) in LOS; <i>p</i>-values for interaction = 0.001 and 0.005, respectively. Using PRSs, we observed that greater genetic risk for VTE, another prothrombotic condition, was more strongly associated with EOS compared with LOS (<i>p</i> = 0.008). The <i>ABO</i> locus, genetically predicted blood group A, and higher genetic propensity for venous thrombosis are more strongly associated with EOS than with LOS, supporting a stronger role of prothrombotic factors in EOS.",Jaworek T; Xu H; Gaynor BJ; Cole JW; Rannikmae K; Stanne TM; Tomppo L; Abedi V; Amouyel P; Armstrong ND; Attia J; Bell S; Benavente OR; Boncoraglio GB; Butterworth A; Carcel-Marquez J; Chen Z; Chong M; Cruchaga C; Cushman M; Danesh J; Debette S; Duggan DJ; Durda JP; Engstrom G; Enzinger C; Faul JD; Fecteau NS; Fernandez-Cadenas I; Gieger C; Giese AK; Grewal RP; Grittner U; Havulinna AS; Heitsch L; Hochberg MC; Holliday E; Hu J; Ilinca A; Irvin MR; Jackson RD; Jacob MA; Rabionet R; Jimenez-Conde J; Johnson JA; Kamatani Y; Kardia SLR; Koido M; Kubo M; Lange L; Lee JM; Lemmens R; Levi CR; Li J; Li L; Lin K; Lopez H; Luke S; Maguire J; McArdle PF; McDonough CW; Meschia JF; Metso T; Müller-Nurasyid M; O'Connor TD; O'Donnell M; Peddareddygari LR; Pera J; Perry JA; Peters A; Putaala J; Ray D; Rexrode K; Ribases M; Rosand J; Rothwell PM; Rundek T; Ryan KA; Sacco RL; Salomaa V; Sanchez-Mora C; Schmidt R; Sharma P; Slowik A; Smith JA; Smith NL; Wassertheil-Smoller S; Söderholm M; Stine OC; Strbian D; Sudlow CLM; Tatlisumak T; Terao C; Thijs V; Torres-Aguila NP; Trégouët DA; Tuladhar AM; Veldink JH; Walters RG; Weir DR; Woo D; Worrall BB; Hong CC; Ross OA; Zand R; Leeuw FE; Lindgren AG; Pare G; Anderson CD; Markus HS; Jern C; Malik R; Dichgans M; Mitchell BD; Kittner SJ,Neurology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36240095/,0,0,0,1,0,0
36235639,Effect of Important Food Sources of Fructose-Containing Sugars on Inflammatory Biomarkers: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Controlled Feeding Trials.,"Fructose-containing sugars as sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) may increase inflammatory biomarkers. Whether this effect is mediated by the food matrix at different levels of energy is unknown. To investigate the role of food source and energy, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials on the effect of different food sources of fructose-containing sugars on inflammatory markers at different levels of energy control. MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched through March 2022 for controlled feeding trials ≥ 7 days. Four trial designs were prespecified by energy control: substitution (energy matched replacement of sugars); addition (excess energy from sugars added to diets); subtraction (energy from sugars subtracted from diets); and ad libitum (energy from sugars freely replaced). The primary outcome was <i>C</i>-reactive protein (CRP). Secondary outcomes were tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Independent reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. GRADE assessed certainty of evidence. We identified 64 controlled trials (91 trial comparisons, <i>n</i> = 4094) assessing 12 food sources (SSB; sweetened dairy; sweetened dairy alternative [soy]; 100% fruit juice; fruit; dried fruit; mixed fruit forms; sweetened cereal grains and bars; sweets and desserts; added nutritive [caloric] sweetener; mixed sources [with SSBs]; and mixed sources [without SSBs]) at 4 levels of energy control over a median 6-weeks in predominantly healthy mixed weight or overweight/obese adults. Total fructose-containing sugars decreased CRP in addition trials and had no effect in substitution, subtraction or ad libitum trials. No effect was observed on other outcomes at any level of energy control. There was evidence of interaction/influence by food source: substitution trials (sweetened dairy alternative (soy) and 100% fruit juice decreased, and mixed sources (with SSBs) increased CRP); and addition trials (fruit decreased CRP and TNF-α; sweets and desserts (dark chocolate) decreased IL-6). The certainty of evidence was moderate-to-low for the majority of analyses. Food source appears to mediate the effect of fructose-containing sugars on inflammatory markers over the short-to-medium term. The evidence provides good indication that mixed sources that contain SSBs increase CRP, while most other food sources have no effect with some sources (fruit, 100% fruit juice, sweetened soy beverage or dark chocolate) showing decreases, which may be dependent on energy control. gov: (NCT02716870).",Qi X; Chiavaroli L; Lee D; Ayoub-Charette S; Khan TA; Au-Yeung F; Ahmed A; Cheung A; Liu Q; Blanco Mejia S; Choo VL; de Souza RJ; Wolever TMS; Leiter LA; Kendall CWC; Jenkins DJA; Sievenpiper JL,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36235639/,0,1,0,1,0,0
36231053,Gut Microbiota in Nutrition and Health with a Special Focus on Specific Bacterial Clusters.,"Health is influenced by how the gut microbiome develops as a result of external and internal factors, such as nutrition, the environment, medication use, age, sex, and genetics. Alpha and beta diversity metrics and (enterotype) clustering methods are commonly employed to perform population studies and to analyse the effects of various treatments, yet, with the continuous development of (new) sequencing technologies, and as various omics fields as a result become more accessible for investigation, increasingly sophisticated methodologies are needed and indeed being developed in order to disentangle the complex ways in which the gut microbiome and health are intertwined. Diseases of affluence, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), are commonly linked to species associated with the <i>Bacteroides</i> enterotype(s) and a decline of various (beneficial) complex microbial trophic networks, which are in turn linked to the aforementioned factors. In this review, we (1) explore the effects that some of the most common internal and external factors have on the gut microbiome composition and how these in turn relate to T2D and CVD, and (2) discuss research opportunities enabled by and the limitations of some of the latest technical developments in the microbiome sector, including the use of artificial intelligence (AI), strain tracking, and peak to trough ratios.",Bresser LRF; de Goffau MC; Levin E; Nieuwdorp M,Cells,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36231053/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36219217,Morphometric features and performances of Black Bengal goat in Bangladesh.,"Black Bengal goat (BBG) is the most adaptable, widely distributed, and prominent goat breed in Bangladesh, well known in the world for its high prolificacy, low demand of feed, tolerance to harsh weather conditions, and disease resistance with remarkably good quality red meat and skin. A large number of indiscriminate research reports on BBG have been published; however, the review on the productive and reproductive performances with different physiological features of BBG in Bangladesh is scarce. This review was conducted to investigate and summarize the available research reports on BBGs to highlight the gaps and provide coherent recommendations for the future research plan for sustainable BBG production in Bangladesh. It covers research works in morphometric features, feeding and nutrition, reproduction, diseases and health management, husbandry practices, and production performances of BBG under local conditions. Due to the contemporary increased demand for animal protein (meat and milk), the scope of small ruminants, especially goat farming, increases with other large ruminants farming. The key constraints of BBG production in Bangladesh include higher disease prevalence with low or no management practices, kid mortality, inadequate feeds and fodder supply, and poor marketing channel with some other stumpy genetic potentialities (slower body weight gain, low milk production) of this goat. Future research would be required to assess the contribution of BBG to household economies and food securities throughout the year and evaluate the constraints, adaptation and extension of artificial insemination (AI), and genetic improvement of economically important traits using molecular techniques and the selective breeding program.",Rakib MRH; Ahmed S; Desha NH; Akther S; Rahman MH; Pasha MMH; Dhakal A; Sultana N; Hemayet MA,Tropical animal health and production,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36219217/,1,0,0,0,0,0

To inform dietary guidance, we synthesised the evidence on white rice and brown rice with T2D risk. Systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched through November 2021. Prospective cohort studies of white and brown rice intake on T2D risk (≥1 year), and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing brown rice with white rice on cardiometabolic risk factors (≥2 weeks). Data were extracted by the primary reviewer and two additional reviewers. Meta-analyses were conducted using random-effects models and reporting followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale for prospective cohort studies and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for RCTs. Strength of the meta-evidence was assessed using NutriGrade. Nineteen articles were included: 8 cohort studies providing 18 estimates (white rice: 15 estimates, 25 956 cases, n=5 77 426; brown rice: 3 estimates, 10 507 cases, n=1 97 228) and 11 RCTs (n=1034). In cohort studies, white rice was associated with higher risk of T2D (pooled RR, 1.16; 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.32) comparing extreme categories. At intakes above ~300 g/day, a dose-response was observed (each 158 g/day serving was associated with 13% (11%-15%) higher risk of T2D). Intake of brown rice was associated with lower risk of T2D (pooled RR, 0.89; 95% CI: 0.81 to 0.97) comparing extreme categories.

The present analysis was designed to systematically review effective evidence of nutrition supplement on rehabilitation for patients with stroke. A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science up to August 1, 2021 was performed to find relevant studies that analyzed the effect of nutrition supplement on rehabilitation of patients with stroke. The primary outcome was functional outcomes and activities of daily living (ADL). The secondary outcomes included disability, all-cause mortality, infections, pneumonia, walking ability, stroke recurrence, and laboratory results indicating nutrition status of patients. All statistical analyses were performed using standard statistical procedures with Review Manager 5.2. Ultimately, 16 studies including 7547 patients were identified. Our pooled results found no significant difference in total, cognitive and motor FIM score between nutrition supplement and placebo groups, with pooled MDs of 7.64 (95% CI - 1.67 to 16.94; P = .11), 0.74 (95% CI - 1.33 to 2.81; P = .48), 1.11 (95% CI - 1.68 to 3.90; P = .44), respectively. However, our result showed that nutritional interventions had significant effect on ADL for patients with stroke (MD 3.26; 95% CI 0.59 to 5.93; P = .02). In addition, nutrition supplement reduced the incidence of infections for patients with stroke, with a pooled RR of 0.65 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.84; P = .0008). No significant results were found in disabilities, complication and laboratory outcomes. The present meta-analysis indicated no statistically significant effect of nutrition supplement on functional outcomes as well as disabilities, complication and laboratory outcomes for patients with stroke. However, it increased ADL and reduced the incidence of infections.",Liu J; Dong J; Guo J,Medicine,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36123946/,0,0,0,1,0,0
36118748,Precision nutrition: Maintaining scientific integrity while realizing market potential.,"Precision Nutrition (PN) is an approach to developing comprehensive and dynamic nutritional recommendations based on individual variables, including genetics, microbiome, metabolic profile, health status, physical activity, dietary pattern, food environment as well as socioeconomic and psychosocial characteristics. PN can help answer the question ""What should I eat to be healthy?"", recognizing that what is healthful for one individual may not be the same for another, and understanding that health and responses to diet change over time. The growth of the PN market has been driven by increasing consumer interest in individualized products and services coupled with advances in technology, analytics, and omic sciences. However, important concerns are evident regarding the adequacy of scientific substantiation supporting claims for current products and services. An additional limitation to accessing PN is the current cost of diagnostic tests and wearable devices. Despite these challenges, PN holds great promise as a tool to improve healthspan and reduce healthcare costs. Accelerating advancement in PN will require: (a) investment in multidisciplinary collaborations to enable the development of user-friendly tools applying technological advances in omics, sensors, artificial intelligence, big data management, and analytics; (b) engagement of healthcare professionals and payers to support equitable and broader adoption of PN as medicine shifts toward preventive and personalized approaches; and (c) system-wide collaboration between stakeholders to advocate for continued support for evidence-based PN, develop a regulatory framework to maintain consumer trust and engagement, and allow PN to reach its full potential.",Berciano S; Figueiredo J; Brisbois TD; Alford S; Koecher K; Eckhouse S; Ciati R; Kussmann M; Ordovas JM; Stebbins K; Blumberg JB,Frontiers in nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36118748/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36102317,Machine-Learning-Based Predictions of Polymer and Postconsumer Recycled Polymer Properties: A Comprehensive Review.,"There has been a tremendous increase in demand for virgin and postconsumer recycled (PCR) polymers due to their wide range of chemical and physical characteristics. Despite the numerous potential benefits of using a data-driven approach to polymer design, major hurdles exist in the development of polymer informatics due to the complicated hierarchical polymer structures. In this review, a brief introduction on virgin polymer structure, PCR polymers, compatibilization of polymers to be recycled, and their characterization using sensor array technologies as well as factors affecting the polymer properties are provided. Machine-learning (ML) algorithms are gaining attention as cost-effective scalable solutions to exploit the physical and chemical structures of polymers. The basic steps for applying ML in polymer science such as fingerprinting, algorithms, open-source databases, representations, and polymer design are detailed in this review. Further, a state-of-the-art review of the prediction of various polymer material properties using ML is reviewed. Finally, we discuss open-ended research questions on ML application to PCR polymers as well as potential challenges in the prediction of their properties using artificial intelligence for more efficient and targeted PCR polymer discovery and development.",Andraju N; Curtzwiler GW; Ji Y; Kozliak E; Ranganathan P,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36102317/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36080901,Thought on Food: A Systematic Review of Current Approaches and Challenges for Food Intake Detection.,"Nowadays, individuals have very stressful lifestyles, affecting their nutritional habits. In the early stages of life, teenagers begin to exhibit bad habits and inadequate nutrition. Likewise, other people with dementia, Alzheimer's disease, or other conditions may not take food or medicine regularly. Therefore, the ability to monitor could be beneficial for them and for the doctors that can analyze the patterns of eating habits and their correlation with overall health. Many sensors help accurately detect food intake episodes, including electrogastrography, cameras, microphones, and inertial sensors. Accurate detection may provide better control to enable healthy nutrition habits. This paper presents a systematic review of the use of technology for food intake detection, focusing on the different sensors and methodologies used. The search was performed with a Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework that helps screen irrelevant studies while following the PRISMA methodology. It automatically searched and filtered the research studies in different databases, including PubMed, Springer, ACM, IEEE Xplore, MDPI, and Elsevier. Then, the manual analysis selected 30 papers based on the results of the framework for further analysis, which support the interest in using sensors for food intake detection and nutrition assessment. The mainly used sensors are cameras, inertial, and acoustic sensors that handle the recognition of food intake episodes with artificial intelligence techniques. This research identifies the most used sensors and data processing methodologies to detect food intake.",Neves PA; Simões J; Costa R; Pimenta L; Gonçalves NJ; Albuquerque C; Cunha C; Zdravevski E; Lameski P; Garcia NM; Pires IM,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36080901/,0,1,0,0,0,0
36071172,Genome-wide association analyses of physical activity and sedentary behavior provide insights into underlying mechanisms and roles in disease prevention.,"Although physical activity and sedentary behavior are moderately heritable, little is known about the mechanisms that influence these traits. Combining data for up to 703,901 individuals from 51 studies in a multi-ancestry meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies yields 99 loci that associate with self-reported moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity during leisure time (MVPA), leisure screen time (LST) and/or sedentary behavior at work. Loci associated with LST are enriched for genes whose expression in skeletal muscle is altered by resistance training. A missense variant in ACTN3 makes the alpha-actinin-3 filaments more flexible, resulting in lower maximal force in isolated type II<sub>A</sub> muscle fibers, and possibly protection from exercise-induced muscle damage. Finally, Mendelian randomization analyses show that beneficial effects of lower LST and higher MVPA on several risk factors and diseases are mediated or confounded by body mass index (BMI). Our results provide insights into physical activity mechanisms and its role in disease prevention.",Wang Z; Emmerich A; Pillon NJ; Moore T; Hemerich D; Cornelis MC; Mazzaferro E; Broos S; Ahluwalia TS; Bartz TM; Bentley AR; Bielak LF; Chong M; Chu AY; Berry D; Dorajoo R; Dueker ND; Kasbohm E; Feenstra B; Feitosa MF; Gieger C; Graff M; Hall LM; Haller T; Hartwig FP; Hillis DA; Huikari V; Heard-Costa N; Holzapfel C; Jackson AU; Johansson Å; Jørgensen AM; Kaakinen MA; Karlsson R; Kerr KF; Kim B; Koolhaas CM; Kutalik Z; Lagou V; Lind PA; Lorentzon M; Lyytikäinen LP; Mangino M; Metzendorf C; Monroe KR; Pacolet A; Pérusse L; Pool R; Richmond RC; Rivera NV; Robiou-du-Pont S; Schraut KE; Schulz CA; Stringham HM; Tanaka T; Teumer A; Turman C; van der Most PJ; Vanmunster M; van Rooij FJA; van Vliet-Ostaptchouk JV; Zhang X; Zhao JH; Zhao W; Balkhiyarova Z; Balslev-Harder MN; Baumeister SE; Beilby J; Blangero J; Boomsma DI; Brage S; Braund PS; Brody JA; Bruinenberg M; Ekelund U; Liu CT; Cole JW; Collins FS; Cupples LA; Esko T; Enroth S; Faul JD; Fernandez-Rhodes L; Fohner AE; Franco OH; Galesloot TE; Gordon SD; Grarup N; Hartman CA; Heiss G; Hui J; Illig T; Jago R; James A; Joshi PK; Jung T; Kähönen M; Kilpeläinen TO; Koh WP; Kolcic I; Kraft PP; Kuusisto J; Launer LJ; Li A; Linneberg A; Luan J; Vidal PM; Medland SE; Milaneschi Y; Moscati A; Musk B; Nelson CP; Nolte IM; Pedersen NL; Peters A; Peyser PA; Power C; Raitakari OT; Reedik M; Reiner AP; Ridker PM; Rudan I; Ryan K; Sarzynski MA; Scott LJ; Scott RA; Sidney S; Siggeirsdottir K; Smith AV; Smith JA; Sonestedt E; Strøm M; Tai ES; Teo KK; Thorand B; Tönjes A; Tremblay A; Uitterlinden AG; Vangipurapu J; van Schoor N; Völker U; Willemsen G; Williams K; Wong Q; Xu H; Young KL; Yuan JM; Zillikens MC; Zonderman AB; Ameur A; Bandinelli S; Bis JC; Boehnke M; Bouchard C; Chasman DI; Smith GD; de Geus EJC; Deldicque L; Dörr M; Evans MK; Ferrucci L; Fornage M; Fox C; Garland T; Gudnason V; Gyllensten U; Hansen T; Hayward C; Horta BL; Hyppönen E; Jarvelin MR; Johnson WC; Kardia SLR; Kiemeney LA; Laakso M; Langenberg C; Lehtimäki T; Marchand LL; Magnusson PKE; Martin NG; Melbye M; Metspalu A; Meyre D; North KE; Ohlsson C; Oldehinkel AJ; Orho-Melander M; Pare G; Park T; Pedersen O; Penninx BWJH; Pers TH; Polasek O; Prokopenko I; Rotimi CN; Samani NJ; Sim X; Snieder H; Sørensen TIA; Spector TD; Timpson NJ; van Dam RM; van der Velde N; van Duijn CM; Vollenweider P; Völzke H; Voortman T; Waeber G; Wareham NJ; Weir DR; Wichmann HE; Wilson JF; Hevener AL; Krook A; Zierath JR; Thomis MAI; Loos RJF; Hoed MD,Nature genetics,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36071172/,0,0,0,1,0,0
36063397,Infectious Diseases Society of America Guidelines on the Treatment and Management of Patients With COVID-19 (September 2022).,"There are many pharmacologic therapies that are being used or considered for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with rapidly changing efficacy and safety evidence from trials. The objective was to develop evidence-based, rapid, living guidelines intended to support patients, clinicians, and other healthcare professionals in their decisions about treatment and management of patients with COVID-19. In March 2020, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel of infectious disease clinicians, pharmacists, and methodologists with varied areas of expertise to regularly review the evidence and make recommendations about the treatment and management of persons with COVID-19. The process used a living guideline approach and followed a rapid recommendation development checklist. The panel prioritized questions and outcomes. A systematic review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted at regular intervals. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make recommendations. Based on the most recent search conducted on 31 May 2022, the IDSA guideline panel has made 32 recommendations for the treatment and management of the following groups/populations: pre- and postexposure prophylaxis, ambulatory with mild-to-moderate disease, and hospitalized with mild-to-moderate, severe but not critical, and critical disease. As these are living guidelines, the most recent recommendations can be found online at: https://idsociety.org/COVID19guidelines. At the inception of its work, the panel has expressed the overarching goal that patients be recruited into ongoing trials. Since then, many trials were conducted that provided much-needed evidence for COVID-19 therapies. There still remain many unanswered questions as the pandemic evolved, which we hope future trials can answer.",Bhimraj A; Morgan RL; Shumaker AH; Baden LR; Cheng VC; Edwards KM; Gallagher JC; Gandhi RT; Muller WJ; Nakamura MM; O'Horo JC; Shafer RW; Shoham S; Murad MH; Mustafa RA; Sultan S; Falck-Ytter Y,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36063397/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36027953,"Clinical risk factors of adverse outcomes among women with COVID-19 in the pregnancy and postpartum period: a sequential, prospective meta-analysis.","This sequential, prospective meta-analysis sought to identify risk factors among pregnant and postpartum women with COVID-19 for adverse outcomes related to disease severity, maternal morbidities, neonatal mortality and morbidity, and adverse birth outcomes. We prospectively invited study investigators to join the sequential, prospective meta-analysis via professional research networks beginning in March 2020. Eligible studies included those recruiting at least 25 consecutive cases of COVID-19 in pregnancy within a defined catchment area. We included individual patient data from 21 participating studies. Data quality was assessed, and harmonized variables for risk factors and outcomes were constructed. Duplicate cases were removed. Pooled estimates for the absolute and relative risk of adverse outcomes comparing those with and without each risk factor were generated using a 2-stage meta-analysis. We collected data from 33 countries and territories, including 21,977 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy or postpartum. We found that women with comorbidities (preexisting diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease) vs those without were at higher risk for COVID-19 severity and adverse pregnancy outcomes (fetal death, preterm birth, low birthweight). Participants with COVID-19 and HIV were 1.74 times (95% confidence interval, 1.12-2.71) more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit. Pregnant women who were underweight before pregnancy were at higher risk of intensive care unit admission (relative risk, 5.53; 95% confidence interval, 2.27-13.44), ventilation (relative risk, 9.36; 95% confidence interval, 3.87-22.63), and pregnancy-related death (relative risk, 14.10; 95% confidence interval, 2.83-70.36). Prepregnancy obesity was also a risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes including intensive care unit admission (relative risk, 1.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-2.60), ventilation (relative risk, 2.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-3.51), any critical care (relative risk, 1.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-2.77), and pneumonia (relative risk, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-2.33). Anemic pregnant women with COVID-19 also had increased risk of intensive care unit admission (relative risk, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-2.11) and death (relative risk, 2.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-4.81). We found that pregnant women with comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease were at increased risk for severe COVID-19-related outcomes, maternal morbidities, and adverse birth outcomes. We also identified several less commonly known risk factors, including HIV infection, prepregnancy underweight, and anemia. Although pregnant women are already considered a high-risk population, special priority for prevention and treatment should be given to pregnant women with these additional risk factors.",Smith ER; Oakley E; Grandner GW; Rukundo G; Farooq F; Ferguson K; Baumann S; Adams Waldorf KM; Afshar Y; Ahlberg M; Ahmadzia H; Akelo V; Aldrovandi G; Bevilacqua E; Bracero N; Brandt JS; Broutet N; Carrillo J; Conry J; Cosmi E; Crispi F; Crovetto F; Del Mar Gil M; Delgado-López C; Divakar H; Driscoll AJ; Favre G; Fernandez Buhigas I; Flaherman V; Gale C; Godwin CL; Gottlieb S; Gratacós E; He S; Hernandez O; Jones S; Joshi S; Kalafat E; Khagayi S; Knight M; Kotloff KL; Lanzone A; Laurita Longo V; Le Doare K; Lees C; Litman E; Lokken EM; Madhi SA; Magee LA; Martinez-Portilla RJ; Metz TD; Miller ES; Money D; Moungmaithong S; Mullins E; Nachega JB; Nunes MC; Onyango D; Panchaud A; Poon LC; Raiten D; Regan L; Sahota D; Sakowicz A; Sanin-Blair J; Stephansson O; Temmerman M; Thorson A; Thwin SS; Tippett Barr BA; Tolosa JE; Tug N; Valencia-Prado M; Visentin S; von Dadelszen P; Whitehead C; Wood M; Yang H; Zavala R; Tielsch JM,American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36027953/,1,0,0,1,0,0
35995048,Obesity Dysregulates the Immune Response to Influenza Infection and Vaccination Through Metabolic and Inflammatory Mechanisms.,"The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates that obesity alone, independent of comorbidities, is a significant risk factor for severe outcomes from infection. This susceptibility mirrors a similar pattern with influenza infection; that is, obesity is a unique risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is critical to understand how obesity contributes to a reduced ability to respond to respiratory viral infections. Herein, we discuss human and animal studies with influenza infection and vaccination that show obesity impairs immunity. We cover several key mechanisms for the dysfunction. These mechanisms include systemic and cellular level changes that dysregulate immune cell metabolism and function in addition to how obesity promotes deficiencies in metabolites that control the resolution of inflammation and infection. Finally, we discuss major gaps in knowledge, particularly as they pertain to diet and mechanisms, which will drive future efforts to improve outcomes in response to respiratory viral infections in an increasingly obese population.",Shaikh SR; MacIver NJ; Beck MA,Annual review of nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35995048/,1,0,0,0,0,0

35955432,Pharmacological Probes to Validate Biomarkers for Analgesic Drug Development.,"There is an urgent need for analgesics with improved efficacy, especially in neuropathic and other chronic pain conditions. Unfortunately, in recent decades, many candidate analgesics have failed in clinical phase II or III trials despite promising preclinical results. Translational assessment tools to verify engagement of pharmacological targets and actions on compartments of the nociceptive system are missing in both rodents and humans. Through the Innovative Medicines Initiative of the European Union and EFPIA, a consortium of researchers from academia and the pharmaceutical industry was established to identify and validate a set of functional biomarkers to assess drug-induced effects on nociceptive processing at peripheral, spinal and supraspinal levels using electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging techniques. Here, we report the results of a systematic literature search for pharmacological probes that allow for validation of these biomarkers. Of 26 candidate substances, only 7 met the inclusion criteria: evidence for nociceptive system modulation, tolerability, availability in oral form for human use and absence of active metabolites. Based on pharmacokinetic characteristics, three were selected for a set of crossover studies in rodents and healthy humans. All currently available probes act on more than one compartment of the nociceptive system. Once validated, biomarkers of nociceptive signal processing, combined with a pharmacometric modelling, will enable a more rational approach to selecting dose ranges and verifying target engagement. Combined with advances in classification of chronic pain conditions, these biomarkers are expected to accelerate analgesic drug development.",van Niel J; Bloms-Funke P; Caspani O; Cendros JM; Garcia-Larrea L; Truini A; Tracey I; Chapman SC; Marco-Ariño N; Troconiz IF; Phillips K; Finnerup NB; Mouraux A; Treede RD,International journal of molecular sciences,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35955432/,0,1,0,0,0,0

The foremost challenge facing the scientific community is to explore the growth and transmission capability of the virus. Use of artificial intelligence (AI), such as deep learning, in (i) rapid disease detection from x-ray or computed tomography (CT) or high-resolution CT (HRCT) images, (ii) accurate prediction of the epidemic patterns and their saturation throughout the globe, (iii) forecasting the disease and psychological impact on the population from social networking data, and (iv) prediction of drug-protein interactions for repurposing the drugs, has attracted much attention. In the present study, we describe the role of various AI-based technologies for rapid and efficient detection from CT images complementing quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunodiagnostic assays. AI-based technologies to anticipate the current pandemic pattern, prevent the spread of disease, and face mask detection are also discussed.

35928834,A Narrative Review of Recent Advances in Rapid Assessment of Anthocyanins in Agricultural and Food Products.,"Anthocyanins (ACNs) are plant polyphenols that have received increased attention recently mainly due to their potential health benefits and applications as functional food ingredients. This has also created an interest in the development and validation of several non-destructive techniques of ACN assessments in several food samples. Non-destructive and conventional techniques play an important role in the assessment of ACNs in agricultural and food products. Although conventional methods appear to be more accurate and specific in their analysis, they are also associated with higher costs, the destruction of samples, time-consuming, and require specialized laboratory equipment. In this review article, we present the latest findings relating to the use of several spectroscopic techniques (fluorescence, Raman, Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and near-infrared spectroscopy), hyperspectral imaging, chemometric-based machine learning, and artificial intelligence applications for assessing the ACN content in agricultural and food products.

35906306,"Using machine learning to impact on long-term clinical care: principles, challenges, and practicalities.","The rise of machine learning in healthcare has significant implications for paediatrics. Long-term conditions with significant disease heterogeneity comprise large portions of the routine work performed by paediatricians. Improving outcomes through discovery of disease and treatment prediction models, alongside novel subgroup clustering of patients, are some of the areas in which machine learning holds significant promise. While artificial intelligence has percolated into routine use in our day to day lives through advertising algorithms, song or movie selections and sifting of spam emails, the ability of machine learning to utilise highly complex and dimensional data has not yet reached its full potential in healthcare. In this review article, we discuss some of the foundations of machine learning, including some of the basic algorithms. We emphasise the importance of correct utilisation of machine learning, including adequate data preparation and external validation. Using nutrition in preterm infants and paediatric inflammatory bowel disease as examples, we discuss the evidence and potential utility of machine learning in paediatrics. Finally, we review some of the future applications, alongside challenges and ethical considerations related to application of artificial intelligence. IMPACT: Machine learning is a widely used term; however, understanding of the process and application to healthcare is lacking.

35898564,A glance into the future of diagnosis and treatment of spondyloarthritis.,"The last two decades have seen major developments in the field of spondyloarthritis (SpA), but there are still important unmet needs to address. In the future, we envisage important advances in the diagnosis and treatment of SpA. In the diagnosis of SpA, the use of online and social media tools will increase awareness of the disease and facilitate the referral of patients to rheumatology clinics. In addition, more specific diagnostic tests will be available, especially advanced imaging methods and new biomarkers. This will allow most patients to be diagnosed at an early stage of the disease. In the treatment of SpA, an increasing number of novel treatment targets can be expected, most of which will be directed against intracellular enzymes. We hope to see more strategy trials shaping treatment pathways in SpA and accommodating principals of precision medicine. Approved treatment options will be available for both axial and peripheral SpA. We also hope to intervene not only at the inflammation level but also at the level of underlying immunological processes that might be associated with a higher probability of long-standing remission if not a cure. Finally, artificial intelligence techniques will allow for the analysis of large-scale data to answer relevant research questions for the diagnosis and management of patients with SpA.",Navarro-Compán V; Ermann J; Poddubnyy D,Therapeutic advances in musculoskeletal disease,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35898564/,1,0,0,0,0,0

35889803,Important Food Sources of Fructose-Containing Sugars and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Controlled Trials.,"Background: Fructose providing excess calories in the form of sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) increases markers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Whether this effect holds for other important food sources of fructose-containing sugars is unclear. To investigate the role of food source and energy, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials of the effect of fructose-containing sugars by food source at different levels of energy control on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) markers. Methods and Findings: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched through 7 January 2022 for controlled trials ≥7-days. Four trial designs were prespecified: substitution (energy-matched substitution of sugars for other macronutrients); addition (excess energy from sugars added to diets); subtraction (excess energy from sugars subtracted from diets); and ad libitum (energy from sugars freely replaced by other macronutrients). The primary outcome was intrahepatocellular lipid (IHCL). Secondary outcomes were alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Independent reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. The certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE. We included 51 trials (75 trial comparisons, n = 2059) of 10 food sources (sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs); sweetened dairy alternative; 100% fruit juice; fruit; dried fruit; mixed fruit sources; sweets and desserts; added nutritive sweetener; honey; and mixed sources (with SSBs)) in predominantly healthy mixed weight or overweight/obese younger adults. Total fructose-containing sugars increased IHCL (standardized mean difference = 1.72 [95% CI, 1.08 to 2.36], p < 0.001) in addition trials and decreased AST in subtraction trials with no effect on any outcome in substitution or ad libitum trials. There was evidence of influence by food source with SSBs increasing IHCL and ALT in addition trials and mixed sources (with SSBs) decreasing AST in subtraction trials. The certainty of evidence was high for the effect on IHCL and moderate for the effect on ALT for SSBs in addition trials, low for the effect on AST for the removal of energy from mixed sources (with SSBs) in subtraction trials, and generally low to moderate for all other comparisons. Conclusions: Energy control and food source appear to mediate the effect of fructose-containing sugars on NAFLD markers. The evidence provides a good indication that the addition of excess energy from SSBs leads to large increases in liver fat and small important increases in ALT while there is less of an indication that the removal of energy from mixed sources (with SSBs) leads to moderate reductions in AST. Varying uncertainty remains for the lack of effect of other important food sources of fructose-containing sugars at different levels of energy control.",Lee D; Chiavaroli L; Ayoub-Charette S; Khan TA; Zurbau A; Au-Yeung F; Cheung A; Liu Q; Qi X; Ahmed A; Choo VL; Blanco Mejia S; Malik VS; El-Sohemy A; de Souza RJ; Wolever TMS; Leiter LA; Kendall CWC; Jenkins DJA; Sievenpiper JL,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35889803/,0,1,0,1,0,0
35841854,The application of computer vision systems in meat science and industry - A review.,"Computer vision systems (CVS) are applied to macro- and microscopic digital photographs captured using digital cameras, ultrasound scanners, computer tomography, and wide-angle imaging cameras. Diverse image acquisition devices make it technically feasible to obtain information about both the external features and internal structures of targeted objects. Attributes measured in CVS can be used to evaluate meat quality. CVS are also used in research related to assessing the composition of animal carcasses, which might help determine the impact of cross-breeding or rearing systems on the quality of meat. The results obtained by the CVS technique also contribute to assessing the impact of technological treatments on the quality of raw and cooked meat. CVS have many positive attributes including objectivity, non-invasiveness, speed, and low cost of analysis and systems are under constant development an improvement. The present review covers computer vision system techniques, stages of measurements, and possibilities for using these to assess carcass and meat quality.",Modzelewska-Kapituła M; Jun S,Meat science,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35841854/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35832629,On the road to explainable AI in drug-drug interactions prediction: A systematic review.,"Over the past decade, polypharmacy instances have been common in multi-diseases treatment. However, unwanted drug-drug interactions (DDIs) that might cause unexpected adverse drug events (ADEs) in multiple regimens therapy remain a significant issue. Since artificial intelligence (AI) is ubiquitous today, many AI prediction models have been developed to predict DDIs to support clinicians in pharmacotherapy-related decisions. However, even though DDI prediction models have great potential for assisting physicians in polypharmacy decisions, there are still concerns regarding the reliability of AI models due to their black-box nature. Building AI models with explainable mechanisms can augment their transparency to address the above issue. Explainable AI (XAI) promotes safety and clarity by showing how decisions are made in AI models, especially in critical tasks like DDI predictions. In this review, a comprehensive overview of AI-based DDI prediction, including the publicly available source for AI-DDIs studies, the methods used in data manipulation and feature preprocessing, the XAI mechanisms to promote trust of AI, especially for critical tasks as DDIs prediction, the modeling methods, is provided. Limitations and the future directions of XAI in DDIs are also discussed.",Vo TH; Nguyen NTK; Kha QH; Le NQK,Computational and structural biotechnology journal,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35832629/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35829892,Scoping Review on ACL Surgery and Registry Data.,"To present an overview of registry-based anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) research, as well as provide insight into the future of ACL registries. During the past decades, the ACL registries have had an important role in increasing our understanding of patients with ACL injuries and their treatment. The registry data has deepened our understanding of factors that have been associated with an increased risk of sustaining an ACL injury and for evaluation of treatment factors and their impact on patient-related outcomes. Recently, registry-based ACL research using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has shown potential to create clinical decision-making tools and analyzing outcomes. Thus, standardization of collected data between the registries is needed to facilitate the further collaboration between registries and to facilitate the interpretation of results and subsequently improve the possibilities for implementation of AI and ML in the registry-based research. Several studies have been based on the current ACL registries providing an insight into the epidemiology of ACL injuries as well as outcomes following ACL reconstruction. However, the current ACL registries are facing future challenges, and thus, new methods and techniques are needed to ensure further good quality and clinical applicability of study findings based on ACL registry data.",Kaarre J; Zsidai B; Narup E; Horvath A; Svantesson E; Hamrin Senorski E; Grassi A; Musahl V; Samuelsson K,Current reviews in musculoskeletal medicine,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35829892/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35815018,A Role for Data Science in Precision Nutrition and Early Brain Development.,"Multimodal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide biomarkers of early influences on neurodevelopment such as nutrition, environmental and genetic factors. As the exposure to early influences can be separated from neurodevelopmental outcomes by many months or years, MRI markers can serve as an important intermediate outcome in multivariate analyses of neurodevelopmental determinants. Key to the success of such work are recent advances in data science as well as the growth of relevant data resources. Multimodal MRI assessment of neurodevelopment can be supplemented with other biomarkers of neurodevelopment such as electroencephalograms, magnetoencephalogram, and non-imaging biomarkers. This review focuses on how maternal nutrition impacts infant brain development, with three purposes: (1) to summarize the current knowledge about how nutrition in stages of pregnancy and breastfeeding impact infant brain development; (2) to discuss multimodal MRI and other measures of early neurodevelopment; and (3) to discuss potential opportunities for data science and artificial intelligence to advance precision nutrition. We hope this review can facilitate the collaborative march toward precision nutrition during pregnancy and the first year of life.",Morton SU; Leyshon BJ; Tamilia E; Vyas R; Sisitsky M; Ladha I; Lasekan JB; Kuchan MJ; Grant PE; Ou Y,Frontiers in psychiatry,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35815018/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35805996,The Contribution of Wnt Signaling to Vascular Complications in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Vascular complications are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). These vascular abnormalities result in a chronic hyperglycemic state, which influences many signaling molecular pathways that initially lead to increased oxidative stress, increased inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction, leading to both microvascular and macrovascular complications. Endothelial dysfunction represents the initial stage in both types of vascular complications; it represents ""mandatory damage"" in the development of microvascular complications and only ""introductory damage"" in the development of macrovascular complications. Increasing scientific evidence has revealed an important role of the Wnt pathway in the pathophysiology of the vascular wall. It is well known that the Wnt pathway is altered in patients with T2DM. This review aims to be an update of the current literature related to the Wnt pathway molecules that are altered in patients with T2DM, which may also be the cause of damage to the vasculature. Both microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) and macrovascular complications (coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease) are analyzed. This review aims to concisely concentrate all the evidence to facilitate the view on the vascular involvement of the Wnt pathway and its components by highlighting the importance of exploring possible therapeutic strategy for patients with T2DM who develop vascular pathologies.",Sanabria-de la Torre R; García-Fontana C; González-Salvatierra S; Andújar-Vera F; Martínez-Heredia L; García-Fontana B; Muñoz-Torres M,International journal of molecular sciences,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35805996/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35805395,Using Artificial Intelligence to Enhance Ongoing Psychological Interventions for Emotional Problems in Real- or Close to Real-Time: A Systematic Review.,"Emotional disorders are the most common mental disorders globally. Psychological treatments have been found to be useful for a significant number of cases, but up to 40% of patients do not respond to psychotherapy as expected. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods might enhance psychotherapy by providing therapists and patients with real- or close to real-time recommendations according to the patient's response to treatment. The goal of this investigation is to systematically review the evidence on the use of AI-based methods to enhance outcomes in psychological interventions in real-time or close to real-time. The search included studies indexed in the electronic databases Scopus, Pubmed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. The terms used for the electronic search included variations of the words ""psychotherapy"", ""artificial intelligence"", and ""emotional disorders"". From the 85 full texts assessed, only 10 studies met our eligibility criteria. In these, the most frequently used AI technique was conversational AI agents, which are chatbots based on software that can be accessed online with a computer or a smartphone. Overall, the reviewed investigations indicated significant positive consequences of using AI to enhance psychotherapy and reduce clinical symptomatology. Additionally, most studies reported high satisfaction, engagement, and retention rates when implementing AI to enhance psychotherapy in real- or close to real-time. Despite the potential of AI to make interventions more flexible and tailored to patients' needs, more methodologically robust studies are needed.",Gual-Montolio P; Jaén I; Martínez-Borba V; Castilla D; Suso-Ribera C,International journal of environmental research and public health,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35805395/,0,1,0,0,0,0
35805046,Circulating Tumor DNA-Based Genomic Profiling Assays in Adult Solid Tumors for Precision Oncology: Recent Advancements and Future Challenges.,"Genomic profiling using tumor biopsies remains the standard approach for the selection of approved molecular targeted therapies. However, this is often limited by its invasiveness, feasibility, and poor sample quality. Liquid biopsies provide a less invasive approach while capturing a contemporaneous and comprehensive tumor genomic profile. Recent advancements in the detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from plasma samples at satisfactory sensitivity, specificity, and detection concordance to tumor tissues have facilitated the approval of ctDNA-based genomic profiling to be integrated into regular clinical practice. The recent approval of both single-gene and multigene assays to detect genetic biomarkers from plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as companion diagnostic tools for molecular targeted therapies has transformed the therapeutic decision-making procedure for advanced solid tumors. Despite the increasing use of cfDNA-based molecular profiling, there is an ongoing debate about a 'plasma first' or 'tissue first' approach toward genomic testing for advanced solid malignancies. Both approaches present possible advantages and disadvantages, and these factors should be carefully considered to personalize and select the most appropriate genomic assay. This review focuses on the recent advancements of cfDNA-based genomic profiling assays in advanced solid tumors while highlighting the major challenges that should be tackled to formulate evidence-based guidelines in recommending the 'right assay for the right patient at the right time'.",Chan HT; Chin YM; Low SK,Cancers,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35805046/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35803496,Applying Image-Based Food-Recognition Systems on Dietary Assessment: A Systematic Review.,"Dietary assessment can be crucial for the overall well-being of humans and, at least in some instances, for the prevention and management of chronic, life-threatening diseases. Recall and manual record-keeping methods for food-intake monitoring are available, but often inaccurate when applied for a long period of time. On the other hand, automatic record-keeping approaches that adopt mobile cameras and computer vision methods seem to simplify the process and can improve current human-centric diet-monitoring methods. Here we present an extended critical literature overview of image-based food-recognition systems (IBFRS) combining a camera of the user's mobile device with computer vision methods and publicly available food datasets (PAFDs). In brief, such systems consist of several phases, such as the segmentation of the food items on the plate, the classification of the food items in a specific food category, and the estimation phase of volume, calories, or nutrients of each food item. A total of 159 studies were screened in this systematic review of IBFRS. A detailed overview of the methods adopted in each of the 78 included studies of this systematic review of IBFRS is provided along with their performance on PAFDs. Studies that included IBFRS without presenting their performance in at least 1 of the above-mentioned phases were excluded. Among the included studies, 45 (58%) studies adopted deep learning methods and especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in at least 1 phase of the IBFRS with input PAFDs. Among the implemented techniques, CNNs outperform all other approaches on the PAFDs with a large volume of data, since the richness of these datasets provides adequate training resources for such algorithms. We also present evidence for the benefits of application of IBFRS in professional dietetic practice. Furthermore, challenges related to the IBFRS presented here are also thoroughly discussed along with future directions.",Dalakleidi KV; Papadelli M; Kapolos I; Papadimitriou K,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35803496/,0,1,0,0,0,0
35782361,Cytokines and microRNAs in SARS-CoV-2: What do we know?,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic constitutes a global health emergency. Currently, there are no completely effective therapeutic medications for the management of this outbreak. The cytokine storm is a hyperinflammatory medical condition due to excessive and uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in patients suffering from severe COVID-19, leading to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and even mortality. Understanding the pathophysiology of COVID-19 can be helpful for the treatment of patients. Evidence suggests that the levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 are dramatically different between mild and severe patients, so they may be important contributors to the cytokine storm. Several serum markers can be predictors for the cytokine storm. This review discusses the cytokines involved in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, focusing on interferons (IFNs) and ILs, and whether they can be used in COVID-19 treatment. Moreover, we highlight several microRNAs that are involved in these cytokines and their role in the cytokine storm caused by COVID-19.",Rarani FZ; Rashidi B; Jafari Najaf Abadi MH; Hamblin MR; Reza Hashemian SM; Mirzaei H,Molecular therapy.

This study also critically value the concepts of PN that are built around the new genetic avenue from both the academic and a commercial perspective and their effectiveness in causing sustained changes in diet, lifestyle, and for improving health. Despite almost 20 years of research and commercial direct-to-consumer offerings, evidence for the success of gene-based dietary recommendations is still generally lacking.

35760871,Guidelines for measuring reactive oxygen species and oxidative damage in cells and in vivo.,"Multiple roles of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their consequences for health and disease are emerging throughout biological sciences. This development has led researchers unfamiliar with the complexities of ROS and their reactions to employ commercial kits and probes to measure ROS and oxidative damage inappropriately, treating ROS (a generic abbreviation) as if it were a discrete molecular entity. Unfortunately, the application and interpretation of these measurements are fraught with challenges and limitations. This can lead to misleading claims entering the literature and impeding progress, despite a well-established body of knowledge on how best to assess individual ROS, their reactions, role as signalling molecules and the oxidative damage that they can cause. In this consensus statement we illuminate problems that can arise with many commonly used approaches for measurement of ROS and oxidative damage, and propose guidelines for best practice. We hope that these strategies will be useful to those who find their research requiring assessment of ROS, oxidative damage and redox signalling in cells and in vivo.",Murphy MP; Bayir H; Belousov V; Chang CJ; Davies KJA; Davies MJ; Dick TP; Finkel T; Forman HJ; Janssen-Heininger Y; Gems D; Kagan VE; Kalyanaraman B; Larsson NG; Milne GL; Nyström T; Poulsen HE; Radi R; Van Remmen H; Schumacker PT; Thornalley PJ; Toyokuni S; Winterbourn CC; Yin H; Halliwell B,Nature metabolism,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35760871/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35740190,Application of Artificial Intelligence in Combating High Antimicrobial Resistance Rates.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of science and engineering that focuses on the computational understanding of intelligent behavior. Many human professions, including clinical diagnosis and prognosis, are greatly useful from AI. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is among the most critical challenges facing Pakistan and the rest of the world. The rising incidence of AMR has become a significant issue, and authorities must take measures to combat the overuse and incorrect use of antibiotics in order to combat rising resistance rates. The widespread use of antibiotics in clinical practice has not only resulted in drug resistance but has also increased the threat of super-resistant bacteria emergence. As AMR rises, clinicians find it more difficult to treat many bacterial infections in a timely manner, and therapy becomes prohibitively costly for patients. To combat the rise in AMR rates, it is critical to implement an institutional antibiotic stewardship program that monitors correct antibiotic use, controls antibiotics, and generates antibiograms. Furthermore, these types of tools may aid in the treatment of patients in the event of a medical emergency in which a physician is unable to wait for bacterial culture results. AI's applications in healthcare might be unlimited, reducing the time it takes to discover new antimicrobial drugs, improving diagnostic and treatment accuracy, and lowering expenses at the same time. The majority of suggested AI solutions for AMR are meant to supplement rather than replace a doctor's prescription or opinion, but rather to serve as a valuable tool for making their work easier. When it comes to infectious diseases, AI has the potential to be a game-changer in the battle against antibiotic resistance. Finally, when selecting antibiotic therapy for infections, data from local antibiotic stewardship programs are critical to ensuring that these bacteria are treated quickly and effectively. Furthermore, organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) have underlined the necessity of selecting the appropriate antibiotic and treating for the shortest time feasible to minimize the spread of resistant and invasive resistant bacterial strains.",Rabaan AA; Alhumaid S; Mutair AA; Garout M; Abulhamayel Y; Halwani MA; Alestad JH; Bshabshe AA; Sulaiman T; AlFonaisan MK; Almusawi T; Albayat H; Alsaeed M; Alfaresi M; Alotaibi S; Alhashem YN; Temsah MH; Ali U; Ahmed N,"Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35740190/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35735595,Application of Artificial Intelligence in the Management of Pancreatic Cystic Lesions.,"The rate of incidentally detected pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) has increased over the past decade and was recently reported at 8%. These lesions pose a unique challenge, as each subtype of PCL carries a different risk of malignant transformation, ranging from 0% (pancreatic pseudocyst) to 34-68% (main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm). It is imperative to correctly risk-stratify the malignant potential of these lesions in order to provide the correct care course for the patient, ranging from monitoring to surgical intervention. Even with the multiplicity of guidelines (i.e., the American Gastroenterology Association guidelines and Fukuoka/International Consensus guidelines) and multitude of diagnostic information, risk stratification of PCLs falls short. Studies have reported that 25-64% of patients undergoing PCL resection have pancreatic cysts with no malignant potential, and up to 78% of mucin-producing cysts resected harbor no malignant potential on pathological evaluation. Clinicians are now incorporating artificial intelligence technology to aid in the management of these difficult lesions. This review article focuses on advancements in artificial intelligence within digital pathomics, radiomics, and genomics as they apply to the diagnosis and risk stratification of PCLs.",Rangwani S; Ardeshna DR; Rodgers B; Melnychuk J; Turner R; Culp S; Chao WL; Krishna SG,"Biomimetics (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35735595/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35728999,Mechanistic insights into dietary (poly)phenols and vascular dysfunction-related diseases using multi-omics and integrative approaches: Machine learning as a next challenge in nutrition research.,"Dietary (poly)phenols have been extensively studied for their vasculoprotective effects and consequently their role in preventing or delaying onsets of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Even though early studies have ascribed the vasculoprotective properties of (poly)phenols primarily on their putative free radical scavenging properties, recent data indicate that in biological systems, (poly)phenols act primarily through genomic and epigenomic mechanisms. The molecular mechanisms underlying their health properties are still not well identified, mainly due to the use of physiologically non-relevant conditions (native molecules or extracts at high concentrations, rather than circulating metabolites), but also due to the use of targeted genomic approaches aiming to evaluate the effect only on few specific genes, thus preventing to decipher detailed molecular mechanisms involved. The use of state-of-the-art untargeted analytical methods represents a significant breakthrough in nutrigenomics, as these methods enable detailed insights into the effects at each specific omics level. Moreover, the implementation of multi-omics approaches allows integration of different levels of regulation of cellular functions, to obtain a comprehensive picture of the molecular mechanisms of action of (poly)phenols. In combination with bioinformatics and the methods of machine learning, multi-omics has potential to make a huge contribution to the nutrition science. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the use of the omics, multi-omics, and integrative approaches in studying the vasculoprotective properties of dietary (poly)phenols and address the potentials for use of the machine learning in nutrigenomics.",Milenkovic D; Ruskovska T,Molecular aspects of medicine,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35728999/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Risk factors include genetics and diabetes mellitus (DM), but little is known about their interaction. We conducted genome-wide association meta-analyses for estimated GFR based on serum creatinine (eGFR), separately for individuals with or without DM (n<sub>DM</sub> = 178,691, n<sub>noDM</sub> = 1,296,113). Our genome-wide searches identified (i) seven eGFR loci with significant DM/noDM-difference, (ii) four additional novel loci with suggestive difference and (iii) 28 further novel loci (including CUBN) by allowing for potential difference. GWAS on eGFR among DM individuals identified 2 known and 27 potentially responsible loci for diabetic kidney disease. Gene prioritization highlighted 18 genes that may inform reno-protective drug development. We highlight the existence of DM-only and noDM-only effects, which can inform about the target group, if respective genes are advanced as drug targets.

35684340,The Role of Microbiome in Brain Development and Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Hundreds of billions of commensal microorganisms live in and on our bodies, most of which colonize the gut shortly after birth and stay there for the rest of our lives. In animal models, bidirectional communications between the central nervous system and gut microbiota (Gut-Brain Axis) have been extensively studied, and it is clear that changes in microbiota composition play a vital role in the pathogenesis of various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Autism Spectrum Disorder, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, anxiety, stress, and so on. The makeup of the microbiome is impacted by a variety of factors, such as genetics, health status, method of delivery, environment, nutrition, and exercise, and the present understanding of the role of gut microbiota and its metabolites in the preservation of brain functioning and the development of the aforementioned neurological illnesses is summarized in this review article. Furthermore, we discuss current breakthroughs in the use of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics to address neurological illnesses. Moreover, we also discussed the role of boron-based diet in memory, boron and microbiome relation, boron as anti-inflammatory agents, and boron in neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, in the coming years, boron reagents will play a significant role to improve dysbiosis and will open new areas for researchers.",Nandwana V; Nandwana NK; Das Y; Saito M; Panda T; Das S; Almaguel F; Hosmane NS; Das BC,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35684340/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35664698,Microfluidics for detection of exosomes and microRNAs in cancer: State of the art.,"Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles with sizes ranging from 30-150 nanometers that contain proteins, lipids, mRNAs, microRNAs, and double-stranded DNA derived from the cells of origin. Exosomes can be taken up by target cells, acting as a means of cell-to-cell communication. The discovery of these vesicles in body fluids and their participation in cell communication has led to major breakthroughs in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of several conditions (e.g., cancer). However, conventional isolation and evaluation of exosomes and their microRNA content suffers from high cost, lengthy processes, difficult standardization, low purity, and poor yield. The emergence of microfluidics devices with increased efficiency in sieving, trapping, and immunological separation of small volumes could provide improved detection and monitoring of exosomes involved in cancer. Microfluidics techniques hold promise for advances in development of diagnostic and prognostic devices. This review covers ongoing research on microfluidics devices for detection of microRNAs and exosomes as biomarkers and their translation to point-of-care and clinical applications.",Mousavi SM; Amin Mahdian SM; Ebrahimi MS; Taghizadieh M; Vosough M; Sadri Nahand J; Hosseindoost S; Vousooghi N; Javar HA; Larijani B; Hadjighassem MR; Rahimian N; Hamblin MR; Mirzaei H,Molecular therapy.

35651843,Dietary Reference Intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for Koreans.,"This paper examines the process and evidence used to create the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) for Koreans. ALA (18:3n3) is an essential fatty acid, and EPA and DHA are known to have beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease risk and reduction of triglyceride levels. Various international organizations have suggested dietary recommendations for n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including ALA, EPA, and DHA. A DRI for Koreans was established for the first time in 2020, specifically for the adequate intake (AI) of ALA and EPA + DHA. This recommendation was based on the average intake of ALA and EPA + DHA from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2013-2017. For Korean infants, the AI of ALA and DHA was based on the fatty acid composition of maternal milk. Estimated average requirement and a tolerable upper intake level have not been set for n-3 PUFA due to insufficient evidence. In addition, the intake level of n-3 PUFA for prevention of chronic disease has also not been determined. Future studies and randomized controlled trials are required to establish the UL and to define the level for disease prevention.",Park Y,Nutrition research and practice,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35651843/,1,0,0,0,0,0

35637881,A survey on computational taste predictors.,"Taste is a sensory modality crucial for nutrition and survival, since it allows the discrimination between healthy foods and toxic substances thanks to five tastes, i.e., sweet, bitter, umami, salty, and sour, associated with distinct nutritional or physiological needs. Today, taste prediction plays a key role in several fields, e.g., medical, industrial, or pharmaceutical, but the complexity of the taste perception process, its multidisciplinary nature, and the high number of potentially relevant players and features at the basis of the taste sensation make taste prediction a very complex task. In this context, the emerging capabilities of machine learning have provided fruitful insights in this field of research, allowing to consider and integrate a very large number of variables and identifying hidden correlations underlying the perception of a particular taste. This review aims at summarizing the latest advances in taste prediction, analyzing available food-related databases and taste prediction tools developed in recent years.

35630331,Preclinical Evidence for the Role of Botulinum Neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) in the Treatment of Peripheral Nerve Injury.,"Traumatic peripheral nerve injuries tend to be more common in younger, working age populations and can lead to long-lasting disability. Peripheral nerves have an impressive capacity to regenerate; however, successful recovery after injury depends on a number of factors including the mechanism and severity of the trauma, the distance from injury to the reinnervation target, connective tissue sheath integrity, and delay between injury and treatment. Even though modern surgical procedures have greatly improved the success rate, many peripheral nerve injuries still culminate in persistent neuropathic pain and incomplete functional recovery. Recent studies in animals suggest that botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) can accelerate nerve regeneration and improve functional recovery after injury to peripheral nerves. Possible mechanisms of BoNT/A action include activation or proliferation of support cells (Schwann cells, mast cells, and macrophages), increased angiogenesis, and improvement of blood flow to regenerating nerves.",Adler M; Pellett S; Sharma SK; Lebeda FJ; Dembek ZF; Mahan MA,Microorganisms,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35630331/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35627141,Macrophage Polarization in Atherosclerosis.,"The implication of the heterogeneous spectrum of pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophages (Macs) has been an important area of investigation over the last decade. The polarization of Macs alters their functional phenotype in response to their surrounding microenvironment. Macs are the major immune cells implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. A hallmark pathology of atherosclerosis is the accumulation of pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages in coronary arteries induced by pro-atherogenic stimuli; these M1-like pro-inflammatory macrophages are incapable of digesting lipids, thus resulting in foam cell formation in the atherosclerotic plaques. Recent findings suggest that the progression and stability of atherosclerotic plaques are dependent on the quantity of infiltrated Macs, the polarization state of the Macs, and the ratios of different types of Mac populations. The polarization of Macs is defined by signature markers on the cell surface, as well as by factors in intracellular and intranuclear compartments. At the same time, pro- and anti-inflammatory polarized Macs also exhibit different gene expression patterns, with differential cellular characteristics in oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. Macs are reflective of different metabolic states and various types of diseases. In this review, we discuss the major differences between M1-like Macs and M2-like Macs, their associated metabolic pathways, and their roles in atherosclerosis.",Eshghjoo S; Kim DM; Jayaraman A; Sun Y; Alaniz RC,Genes,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35627141/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35616720,"Cancer, Phase Angle and Sarcopenia: The Role of Diet in Connection with Lung Cancer Prognosis.","Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death and is associated with malnutrition and sarcopenia. The detection of sarcopenia and conduction of simple body composition measurements, such as the phase angle (PhA) deriving from bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), can help to early identify, monitor, prevent and treat malnutrition. The present review aims to clarify the relationship between PhA and sarcopenia with the pathophysiology, clinical outcomes, and therapeutic aspects of lung cancer. PhA and sarcopenia are connected to lung cancer prognosis through various mechanisms including inflammation and oxidative stress, although more research is needed to identify the critical thresholds for increased mortality risk. Moreover, emphasis is given on the role of dietary interventions (oral nutritional supplementation, and dietary counseling) to manage sarcopenia and related variables in patients with lung cancer. Oral nutritional supplements and/or those containing n - 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may have a positive effect on physical strength measures and muscle mass if administered at the beginning of chemotherapy. Data on sole dietary counseling or multimodal interventions are less promising so far. In the future, sophisticated body composition phenotypes deriving from the described methods along with artificial intelligence techniques could be used to design personalized nutrition interventions and timely treat these patients.",Detopoulou P; Voulgaridou G; Papadopoulou S,Lung,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35616720/,1,0,0,0,0,0

However, these multi-source heterogeneous food data appear as information silos, leading to difficulty in fully exploiting these food data. The knowledge graph provides a unified and standardized conceptual terminology in a structured form, and thus can effectively organize these food data to benefit various applications. In this review, we provide a brief introduction to knowledge graphs and the evolution of food knowledge organization mainly from food ontology to food knowledge graphs. We then summarize seven representative applications of food knowledge graphs, such as new recipe development, diet-disease correlation discovery, and personalized dietary recommendation. We also discuss future directions in this field, such as multimodal food knowledge graph construction and food knowledge graphs for human health.",Min W; Liu C; Xu L; Jiang S,"Patterns (New York, N.Y.)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35607620/,1,0,0,0,0,0

35589249,Breakthroughs in therapies for NASH and remaining challenges.,"Initially a condition that received limited recognition and whose clinical impact was controversial, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has become a leading cause of chronic liver disease. Although there are no approved therapies, major breakthroughs, which will be reviewed here, have paved the way for future therapeutic successes. The unmet medical need in NASH is no longer disputed, and progress in the understanding of its pathogenesis has resulted in the identification of many pharmacological targets. Key surrogate outcomes for therapeutic trials are now accepted by regulatory agencies, thus creating a path for drug registration. A set of non-invasive measurements enabled early-stage trials to be conducted expeditiously, thus providing early indications on the biological and possibly clinical actions of therapeutic candidates. This generated efficacy results for a number of highly promising compounds that are now in late-stage development. Intense research aimed at further improving the assessment of histological endpoints and in developing non-invasive predictive biomarkers is underway. This will help improve the design and feasibility of successful trials, ultimately providing patients with therapeutic options that can change the course of the disease.",Ratziu V; Francque S; Sanyal A,Journal of hepatology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35589249/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Several reviews have explored the associations of public open space attributes with physically active and sedentary behavior. However, few reviews have included studies from Asia, and no studies have focused on dense urban areas. This systematic review analyzed 18 observational studies investigating associations between public open space attributes with physical activity and sedentary behavior in dense urban areas of East Asian countries, including Japan, Taiwan, China, and Hong Kong. We found that closer distance to and a greater number of public open spaces and features within them were positively associated with leisure-time physical activity. Places near water features and corridors within public open spaces were associated with more sedentary behavior. These findings inform landscape and urban design guidelines for (re)designing public open spaces to support active lifestyles in high dense urban areas.",Motomura M; Koohsari MJ; Lin CY; Ishii K; Shibata A; Nakaya T; Kaczynski AT; Veitch J; Oka K,Health & place,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35580456/,0,1,0,0,0,0

Their production, however, impacts the environment and its capacity to sustain us. Growing knowledge across multiple disciplines improves our understanding of links between food, health and sustainability, but increases apparent complexity. Whereas past dietary guidelines placed limits on total fat intake especially saturated fats, recent studies indicate more complex links with health. Guidelines differ between regions of general poverty and malnutrition and those where obesity is a growing problem. Optimization of production to benefit health and environmental outcomes is hindered by limited data and shared societal goals. We lack a detailed overview of where fats are being produced, and their environmental impacts.

Diverse groups of fungi produce different proteins and secondary metabolites, which possess tremendous biotechnological and pharmaceutical applications. Furthermore, its use and acceptability can be accelerated by adopting multi-omics, bioinformatics, and machine learning tools that generate a huge amount of molecular data. The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning tools in the era of omics and big data has opened up a new outlook in both basic and applied researches in the area of nutraceuticals and functional food and nutrition.

35534766,Vision for Improving Pregnancy Health: Innovation and the Future of Pregnancy Research.,"Understanding, predicting, and preventing pregnancy disorders have been a major research target. Nonetheless, the lack of progress is illustrated by research results related to preeclampsia and other hypertensive pregnancy disorders. These remain a major cause of maternal and infant mortality worldwide. There is a general consensus that the rate of progress toward understanding pregnancy disorders lags behind progress in other aspects of human health. In this presentation, we advance an explanation for this failure and suggest solutions. We propose that progress has been impeded by narrowly focused research training and limited imagination and innovation, resulting in the failure to think beyond conventional research approaches and analytical strategies. Investigations have been largely limited to hypothesis-generating approaches constrained by attempts to force poorly defined complex disorders into a single ""unifying"" hypothesis. Future progress could be accelerated by rethinking this approach. We advise taking advantage of innovative approaches that will generate new research strategies for investigating pregnancy abnormalities. Studies should begin before conception, assessing pregnancy longitudinally, before, during, and after pregnancy. Pregnancy disorders should be defined by pathophysiology rather than phenotype, and state of the art agnostic assessment of data should be adopted to generate new ideas. Taking advantage of new approaches mandates emphasizing innovation, inclusion of large datasets, and use of state of the art experimental and analytical techniques. A revolution in understanding pregnancy-associated disorders will depend on networks of scientists who are driven by an intense biological curiosity, a team spirit, and the tools to make new discoveries.",Roberts JM; Heider D; Bergman L; Thornburg KL,"Reproductive sciences (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35534766/,1,0,0,0,0,1
35509425,Application of artificial intelligence in diagnosis of pancreatic malignancies by endoscopic ultrasound: a systemic review.,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly fatal malignancy with a global overall 5-year survival of under 10%. Screening of PC is not recommended outside of clinical trials. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is a very sensitive test to identify PC but lacks specificity and is operator-dependent, especially in the presence of chronic pancreatitis (CP). Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a growing field with a wide range of applications to augment the currently available modalities. This study was undertaken to study the effectiveness of AI with EUS in the diagnosis of PC. Studies from MEDLINE and EMBASE databases reporting the AI performance applied to EUS imaging for recognizing PC. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool was used to assess the quality of the included studies. A total of 11 articles reported the role of EUS in the diagnosis of PC. The overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of AI in recognizing PC were 80-97.5%, 83-100%, and 50-99%, respectively, with corresponding positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 75-99% and 57-100%, respectively. Types of AI studied were artificial neural networks (ANNs), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and support vector machine (SVM). Seven studies using other than basic ANN reported a sensitivity and specificity of 88-96% and 83-94% to differentiate PC from CP. Two studies using SVM reported a 94-96% sensitivity, 93%-99% specificity, and 94-98% accuracy to diagnose PC from CP. The reported sensitivity and specificity of detection of malignant from benign Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms (IPMNs) was 96% and 92%, respectively.

35487537,Early-life respiratory tract infections and the risk of school-age lower lung function and asthma: a meta-analysis of 150 000 European children.,"Early-life respiratory tract infections might affect chronic obstructive respiratory diseases, but conclusive studies from general populations are lacking. Our objective was to examine if children with early-life respiratory tract infections had increased risks of lower lung function and asthma at school age. We used individual participant data of 150 090 children primarily from the EU Child Cohort Network to examine the associations of upper and lower respiratory tract infections from age 6 months to 5 years with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC, forced expiratory flow at 75% of FVC (FEF<sub>75%</sub>) and asthma at a median (range) age of 7 (4-15) years. Children with early-life lower, not upper, respiratory tract infections had a lower school-age FEV<sub>1</sub>, FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC and FEF<sub>75%</sub> (z-score range: -0.09 (95% CI -0.14- -0.04) to -0.30 (95% CI -0.36- -0.24)). Children with early-life lower respiratory tract infections had a higher increased risk of school-age asthma than those with upper respiratory tract infections (OR range: 2.10 (95% CI 1.98-2.22) to 6.30 (95% CI 5.64-7.04) and 1.25 (95% CI 1.18-1.32) to 1.55 (95% CI 1.47-1.65), respectively). Adjustment for preceding respiratory tract infections slightly decreased the strength of the effects. Observed associations were similar for those with and without early-life wheezing as a proxy for early-life asthma.

35479632,Could Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning and Inclusion of Diet-Gut Microbiome Interactions Improve Disease Risk Prediction? Case Study: Coronary Artery Disease.,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the main leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, posing a huge socio-economic burden to the society and health systems. Therefore, timely and precise identification of people at high risk of CAD is urgently required. Most current CAD risk prediction approaches are based on a small number of traditional risk factors (age, sex, diabetes, LDL and HDL cholesterol, smoking, systolic blood pressure) and are incompletely predictive across all patient groups, as CAD is a multi-factorial disease with complex etiology, considered to be driven by both genetic, as well as numerous environmental/lifestyle factors. Diet is one of the modifiable factors for improving lifestyle and disease prevention. However, the current rise in obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and CVD/CAD indicates that the ""one-size-fits-all"" approach may not be efficient, due to significant variation in inter-individual responses. Recently, the gut microbiome has emerged as a potential and previously under-explored contributor to these variations. Hence, efficient integration of dietary and gut microbiome information alongside with genetic variations and clinical data holds a great promise to improve CAD risk prediction. Nevertheless, the highly complex nature of meals combined with the huge inter-individual variability of the gut microbiome poses several Big Data analytics challenges in modeling diet-gut microbiota interactions and integrating these within CAD risk prediction approaches for the development of personalized decision support systems (DSS). In this regard, the recent re-emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML) is opening intriguing perspectives, as these approaches are able to capture large and complex matrices of data, incorporating their interactions and identifying both linear and non-linear relationships. In this Mini-Review, we consider (1) the most used AI/ML approaches and their different use cases for CAD risk prediction (2) modeling of the content, choice and impact of dietary factors on CAD risk; (3) classification of individuals by their gut microbiome composition into CAD cases vs. controls and (4) modeling of the diet-gut microbiome interactions and their impact on CAD risk. Finally, we provide an outlook for putting it all together for improved CAD risk predictions.",Vilne B; Ķibilds J; Siksna I; Lazda I; Valciņa O; Krūmiņa A,Frontiers in microbiology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35479632/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35436418,Long Noncoding RNAs That Function in Nutrition: Lnc-ing Nutritional Cues to Metabolic Pathways.,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are sensitive to changing environments and play key roles in health and disease. Emerging evidence indicates that lncRNAs regulate gene expression to shape metabolic processes in response to changing nutritional cues. Here we review various lncRNAs sensitive to fasting, feeding, and high-fat diet in key metabolic tissues (liver, adipose, and muscle), highlighting regulatory mechanisms that trigger expression changes of lncRNAs themselves, and how these lncRNAs regulate gene expression of key metabolic genes in specific cell types or across tissues. Determining how lncRNAs respond to changes in nutrition is critical for our understanding of the complex downstream cascades following dietary changes and can shape how we treat metabolic disease. Furthermore, investigating sex biases that might influence lncRNA-regulated responses will likely reveal contributions toward the observed disparities between the sexes in metabolic diseases.",Lovell CD; Anguera MC,Annual review of nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35436418/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35419602,ASAS-NANP symposium: mathematical modeling in animal nutrition: limitations and potential next steps for modeling and modelers in the animal sciences.,"The field of animal science, and especially animal nutrition, relies heavily on modeling to accomplish its day-to-day objectives. New data streams (""big data"") and the exponential increase in computing power have allowed the appearance of ""new"" modeling methodologies, under the umbrella of artificial intelligence (AI). However, many of these modeling methodologies have been around for decades. According to Gartner, technological innovation follows five distinct phases: technology trigger, peak of inflated expectations, trough of disillusionment, slope of enlightenment, and plateau of productivity. The appearance of AI certainly elicited much hype within agriculture leading to overpromised plug-and-play solutions in a field heavily dependent on custom solutions. The threat of failure can become real when advertising a disruptive innovation as sustainable. This does not mean that we need to abandon AI models. What is most necessary is to demystify the field and place a lesser emphasis on the technology and more on business application. As AI becomes increasingly more powerful and applications start to diverge, new research fields are introduced, and opportunities arise to combine ""old"" and ""new"" modeling technologies into hybrids. However, sustainable application is still many years away, and companies and universities alike do well to remain at the forefront. This requires investment in hardware, software, and analytical talent. It also requires a strong connection to the outside world to test, that which does, and does not work in practice and a close view of when the field of agriculture is ready to take its next big steps. Other research fields, such as engineering and automotive, have shown that the application power of AI can be far reaching but only if a realistic view of models as whole is maintained. In this review, we share our view on the current and future limitations of modeling and potential next steps for modelers in the animal sciences. First, we discuss the inherent dependencies and limitations of modeling as a human process. Then, we highlight how models, fueled by AI, can play an enhanced sustainable role in the animal sciences ecosystem. Lastly, we provide recommendations for future animal scientists on how to support themselves, the farmers, and their field, considering the opportunities and challenges the technological innovation brings.",Jacobs M; Remus A; Gaillard C; Menendez HM; Tedeschi LO; Neethirajan S; Ellis JL,Journal of animal science,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35419602/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35365361,ESPEN micronutrient guideline.,"Trace elements and vitamins, named together micronutrients (MNs), are essential for human metabolism. Recent research has shown the importance of MNs in common pathologies, with significant deficiencies impacting the outcome. This guideline aims to provide information for daily clinical nutrition practice regarding assessment of MN status, monitoring, and prescription. It proposes a consensus terminology, since many words are used imprecisely, resulting in confusion. This is particularly true for the words ""deficiency"", ""repletion"", ""complement"", and ""supplement"". The expert group attempted to apply the 2015 standard operating procedures (SOP) for ESPEN which focuses on disease. However, this approach could not be applied due to the multiple diseases requiring clinical nutrition resulting in one text for each MN, rather than for diseases. An extensive search of the literature was conducted in the databases Medline, PubMed, Cochrane, Google Scholar, and CINAHL. The search focused on physiological data, historical evidence (published before PubMed release in 1996), and observational and/or randomized trials. For each MN, the main functions, optimal analytical methods, impact of inflammation, potential toxicity, and provision during enteral or parenteral nutrition were addressed. The SOP wording was applied for strength of recommendations. There was a limited number of interventional trials, preventing meta-analysis and leading to a low level of evidence. The recommendations underwent a consensus process, which resulted in a percentage of agreement (%): strong consensus required of >90% of votes. Altogether the guideline proposes sets of recommendations for 26 MNs, resulting in 170 single recommendations. Critical MNs were identified with deficiencies being present in numerous acute and chronic diseases. Monitoring and management strategies are proposed. This guideline should enable addressing suboptimal and deficient status of a bundle of MNs in at-risk diseases. In particular, it offers practical advice on MN provision and monitoring during nutritional support.",Berger MM; Shenkin A; Schweinlin A; Amrein K; Augsburger M; Biesalski HK; Bischoff SC; Casaer MP; Gundogan K; Lepp HL; de Man AME; Muscogiuri G; Pietka M; Pironi L; Rezzi S; Cuerda C,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35365361/,0,0,0,1,0,0
35359878,Regression of Liver Steatosis Following Phosphatidylcholine Administration: A Review of Molecular and Metabolic Pathways Involved.,"Liver steatosis is a key pathology in non-alcoholic or metabolic associated fatty liver disease. Though largely ignored for decades it is currently becoming the focus of research in hepatology. It is important to consider its origin and current opportunities in terms of pharmacotherapy. Essential phospholipids (EPLs) rich in phosphatidylcholine (PCH) is a widely used treatment option for fatty liver disease, and there is a solid amount of consistent clinical evidence for the regression of steatosis after treatment with EPLs. As knowledge of PCH (a key component of EPLs) pharmacodynamics and mode of action driving this widely observed clinical effect is currently insufficient, we aimed to explore the potential molecular and metabolic pathways involved in the positive effects of PCH on steatosis regression.",Osipova D; Kokoreva K; Lazebnik L; Golovanova E; Pavlov C; Dukhanin A; Orlova S; Starostin K,Frontiers in pharmacology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35359878/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35348398,Multimedia Data-Based Mobile Applications for Dietary Assessment.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) and obesity are chronic medical conditions associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Accurate macronutrient and energy estimation could be beneficial in attempts to manage DM and obesity, leading to improved glycemic control and weight reduction, respectively. Existing dietary assessment methods are subject to major errors in measurement, are time consuming, are costly, and do not provide real-time feedback. The increasing adoption of smartphones and artificial intelligence, along with the advances in algorithms and hardware, allowed the development of technologies executed in smartphones that use food/beverage multimedia data as an input, and output information about the nutrient content in almost real time. Scope of this review was to explore the various image-based and video-based systems designed for dietary assessment. We identified 22 different systems and divided these into three categories on the basis of their setting for evaluation: laboratory (12), preclinical (7), and clinical (3). The major findings of the review are that there is still a number of open research questions and technical challenges to be addressed and end users-including health care professionals and patients-need to be involved in the design and development of such innovative solutions. Last, there is a clear need that these systems should be validated under unconstrained real-life conditions and that they should be compared with conventional methods for dietary assessment.",Vasiloglou MF; Marcano I; Lizama S; Papathanail I; Spanakis EK; Mougiakakou S,Journal of diabetes science and technology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35348398/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35328419,Micronutrient Improvement of Epithelial Barrier Function in Various Disease States: A Case for Adjuvant Therapy.,"The published literature makes a very strong case that a wide range of disease morbidity associates with and may in part be due to epithelial barrier leak. An equally large body of published literature substantiates that a diverse group of micronutrients can reduce barrier leak across a wide array of epithelial tissue types, stemming from both cell culture as well as animal and human tissue models. Conversely, micronutrient deficiencies can exacerbate both barrier leak and morbidity. Focusing on zinc, Vitamin A and Vitamin D, this review shows that at concentrations above RDA levels but well below toxicity limits, these micronutrients can induce cell- and tissue-specific molecular-level changes in tight junctional complexes (and by other mechanisms) that reduce barrier leak. An opportunity now exists in critical care-but also medical prophylactic and therapeutic care in general-to consider implementation of select micronutrients at elevated dosages as adjuvant therapeutics in a variety of disease management. This consideration is particularly pointed amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.",DiGuilio KM; Rybakovsky E; Abdavies R; Chamoun R; Flounders CA; Shepley-McTaggart A; Harty RN; Mullin JM,International journal of molecular sciences,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35328419/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35324845,"Towards Improving the Outcomes of Multiple Ovulation and Embryo Transfer in Sheep, with Particular Focus on Donor Superovulation.","Considerable improvements in sheep multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET)protocols have been made; however, unlike for cattle, MOET is poorly developed in sheep, and thus has not been broadly applicable as a routine procedure. The tightly folded nature of the ewe cervix, the inconsistent ovarian response to various superovulatory treatments, and the requirement of labor to handle animals, particularly during large-scale production, has limited the implementation of successful MOET in sheep. Moreover, several extrinsic factors (e.g., sources, the purity of gonadotrophins and their administration) and intrinsic factors (e.g., breed, age, nutrition, reproductive status) severely limit the practicability of MOET in sheep and other domestic animals. In this review, we summarize the effects of different superovulatory protocols, and their respective ovarian responses, in terms of ovulation rate, and embryo recovery and transfer. Furthermore, various strategies, such as inhibin immunization, conventional superovulation protocols, and melatonin implants for improving the ovarian response, are discussed in detail. Other reproductive techniques and their relative advantages and disadvantages, such as artificial insemination (AI), and donor embryo recovery and transfer to the recipient through different procedures, which must be taken into consideration for achieving satisfactory results during any MOET program in sheep, are also summarized in this article.",Khan SU; Jamal MA; Su Y; Wei HJ; Qing Y; Cheng W,Veterinary sciences,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35324845/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35294044,Vitamin A supplementation for preventing morbidity and mortality in children from six months to five years of age.,"Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is a major public health problem in low- and middle-income countries, affecting 190 million children under five years of age and leading to many adverse health consequences, including death. Based on prior evidence and a previous version of this review, the World Health Organization has continued to recommend vitamin A supplementation (VAS) for children aged 6 to 59 months. The last version of this review was published in 2017, and this is an updated version of that review. To assess the effects of vitamin A supplementation (VAS) for preventing morbidity and mortality in children aged six months to five years. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, six other databases, and two trials registers up to March 2021. We also checked reference lists and contacted relevant organisations and researchers to identify additional studies. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs evaluating the effect of synthetic VAS in children aged six months to five years living in the community. We excluded studies involving children in hospital and children with disease or infection. We also excluded studies evaluating the effects of food fortification, consumption of vitamin A rich foods, or beta-carotene supplementation. For this update, two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion resolving discrepancies by discussion. We performed meta-analyses for outcomes, including all-cause and cause-specific mortality, disease, vision, and side effects. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. The updated search identified no new RCTs. We identified 47 studies, involving approximately 1,223,856 children. Studies were set in 19 countries: 30 (63%) in Asia, 16 of these in India; 8 (17%) in Africa; 7 (15%) in Latin America, and 2 (4%) in Australia. About one-third of the studies were in urban/periurban settings, and half were in rural settings; the remaining studies did not clearly report settings. Most studies included equal numbers of girls and boys and lasted about one year. The mean age of the children was about 33 months. The included studies were at variable overall risk of bias; however, evidence for the primary outcome was at low risk of bias. A meta-analysis for all-cause mortality included 19 trials (1,202,382 children). At longest follow-up, there was a 12% observed reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality for VAS compared with control using a fixed-effect model (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 0.93; high-certainty evidence). Nine trials reported mortality due to diarrhoea and showed a 12% overall reduction for VAS (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.98; 1,098,538 children; high-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference for VAS on mortality due to measles (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.11; 6 studies, 1,088,261 children; low-certainty evidence), respiratory disease (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.12; 9 studies, 1,098,538 children; low-certainty evidence), and meningitis. VAS reduced the incidence of diarrhoea (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.87; 15 studies, 77,946 children; low-certainty evidence), measles (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.69; 2 studies, 1,982 children; low-certainty evidence), Bitot's spots (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.53; 5 studies, 1,063,278 children; moderate-certainty evidence), night blindness (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.50; 2 studies, 22,972 children; moderate-certainty evidence), and VAD (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.78; 4 studies, 2262 children, moderate-certainty evidence). However, there was no evidence of a difference on incidence of respiratory disease (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.06; 11 studies, 27,540 children; low-certainty evidence) or hospitalisations due to diarrhoea or pneumonia. There was an increased risk of vomiting within the first 48 hours of VAS (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.69; 4 studies, 10,541 children; moderate-certainty evidence). This update identified no new eligible studies and the conclusions remain the same. VAS is associated with a clinically meaningful reduction in morbidity and mortality in children. Further placebo-controlled trials of VAS in children between six months and five years of age would not change the conclusions of this review, although studies that compare different doses and delivery mechanisms are needed. In populations with documented VAD, it would be unethical to conduct placebo-controlled trials.",Imdad A; Mayo-Wilson E; Haykal MR; Regan A; Sidhu J; Smith A; Bhutta ZA,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35294044/,0,1,0,1,0,1
35281070,Maternal Influences and Intervention Strategies on the Development of Food Allergy in Offspring.,"Food allergies and other immune-mediated diseases have become serious health concerns amongst infants and children in developed and developing countries. The absence of available cures limits disease management to allergen avoidance and symptomatic treatments. Research has suggested that the presence of maternal food allergies may expose the offspring to genetic predisposition, making them more susceptible to allergen sensitization. The following review has focused on epidemiologic studies regarding maternal influences of proneness to develop food allergy in offspring. The search strategy was ""food allergy OR maternal effects OR offspring OR prevention"". A systematically search from PubMed/MEDLINE, Science Direct and Google Scholar was conducted. Specifically, it discussed the effects of maternal immunity, microbiota, breastfeeding, genotype and allergy exposure on the development of food allergy in offspring. In addition, several commonly utilized prenatal and postpartum strategies to reduce food allergy proneness were presented, including early diagnosis of high-risk infants and various dietary interventions.",Jiao L; Su CW; Cao T; Zheng S; Walker WA; Shi HN,Frontiers in immunology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35281070/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35269266,Engineered Nanotechnology: An Effective Therapeutic Platform for the Chronic Cutaneous Wound.,"The healing of chronic wound infections, especially cutaneous wounds, involves a complex cascade of events demanding mutual interaction between immunity and other natural host processes. Wound infections are caused by the consortia of microbial species that keep on proliferating and produce various types of virulence factors that cause the development of chronic infections. The mono- or polymicrobial nature of surface wound infections is best characterized by its ability to form biofilm that renders antimicrobial resistance to commonly administered drugs due to poor biofilm matrix permeability. With an increasing incidence of chronic wound biofilm infections, there is an urgent need for non-conventional antimicrobial approaches, such as developing nanomaterials that have intrinsic antimicrobial-antibiofilm properties modulating the biochemical or biophysical parameters in the wound microenvironment in order to cause disruption and removal of biofilms, such as designing nanomaterials as efficient drug-delivery vehicles carrying antibiotics, bioactive compounds, growth factor antioxidants or stem cells reaching the infection sites and having a distinct mechanism of action in comparison to antibiotics-functionalized nanoparticles (NPs) for better incursion through the biofilm matrix. NPs are thought to act by modulating the microbial colonization and biofilm formation in wounds due to their differential particle size, shape, surface charge and composition through alterations in bacterial cell membrane composition, as well as their conductivity, loss of respiratory activity, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitrosation of cysteines of proteins, lipid peroxidation, DNA unwinding and modulation of metabolic pathways. For the treatment of chronic wounds, extensive research is ongoing to explore a variety of nanoplatforms, including metallic and nonmetallic NPs, nanofibers and self-accumulating nanocarriers. As the use of the magnetic nanoparticle (MNP)-entrenched pre-designed hydrogel sheet (MPS) is found to enhance wound healing, the bio-nanocomposites consisting of bacterial cellulose and magnetic nanoparticles (magnetite) are now successfully used for the healing of chronic wounds. With the objective of precise targeting, some kinds of ""intelligent"" nanoparticles are constructed to react according to the required environment, which are later incorporated in the dressings, so that the wound can be treated with nano-impregnated dressing material in situ. For the effective healing of skin wounds, high-expressing, transiently modified stem cells, controlled by nano 3D architectures, have been developed to encourage angiogenesis and tissue regeneration. In order to overcome the challenge of time and dose constraints during drug administration, the approach of combinatorial nano therapy is adopted, whereby AI will help to exploit the full potential of nanomedicine to treat chronic wounds.",Mallick S; Nag M; Lahiri D; Pandit S; Sarkar T; Pati S; Nirmal NP; Edinur HA; Kari ZA; Ahmad Mohd Zain MR; Ray RR,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35269266/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We executed a consensus-based international strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis. Four general coordinators, six field coordinators, and 12 experts participated in the study. SWOTs were provided for the following fields: neurogastroenterology, functional gastrointestinal disorders, and upper gastrointestinal diseases; inflammatory bowel disease; pancreatology and biliary diseases; endoscopy; gastrointestinal oncology; and hepatology. The GASTROSWOT analysis highlights the following in the current state of the field of gastroenterology: the incidence and complexity of several gastrointestinal diseases, including malignancies, are increasing; the COVID-19 pandemic has affected patient care on several levels; and with the advent of technical innovations in gastroenterology, a well trained workforce and strategic planning are required to optimise health-care utilisation. The analysis calls attention to the following in the future of gastroenterology: artificial intelligence and the use of big data will speed up discovery and smarter health-care provision in the field; the growth and diversification of gastroenterological specialties will improve specialised care for patients, but could promote fragmentation of care and health system inefficiencies; and furthermore, thoughtful planning is needed to reach an effective balance between the need for subspecialists and the value of general gastroenterology services.",de-Madaria E; Mira JJ; Carrillo I; Afif W; Ang D; Antelo M; Bollipo S; Castells A; Chahal P; Heinrich H; Law JK; van Leerdam ME; Lens S; Pannala R; Park SH; Rabiee A; Savarino EV; Singh VK; Vargo J; Charabaty A; Drenth JPH,The lancet.

Data will be discussed from contemporary publications in the field, as well as the Intestinal Transplant Registry. Significant improvements have been made in early outcomes following ITx, yet long-term survival remains challenged by rejection. Although endoscopy and biopsy are the gold-standard for graft monitoring, some centers have performed ITx recently without surveillance endoscopy or stoma formation with similar success. Others have touted the need for less-invasive, timely and accurate biomarkers as essential to help improve results.

The study incorporated 35 published and unpublished randomized controlled trials and observational studies investigating specific mask effectiveness against influenza virus, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar and medRxiv databases for studies published up to 5 February 2021 (PROSPERO registration: CRD42020214729). The primary outcome of interest was the rate of respiratory viral infection. The quality of evidence was estimated using the GRADE approach. High compliance to mask-wearing conferred a significantly better protection (odds ratio [OR], 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23-0.82) than low compliance. N95 or equivalent masks were the most effective in providing protection against coronavirus infections (OR, 0.30; CI, 0.20-0.44) consistently across subgroup analyses of causative viruses and clinical settings. Evidence supporting the use of medical or surgical masks against influenza or coronavirus infections (SARS, MERS and COVID-19) was weak. Our study confirmed that the use of facemasks provides protection against respiratory viral infections in general; however, the effectiveness may vary according to the type of facemask used. Our findings encourage the use of N95 respirators or their equivalents (e.g., P2) for best personal protection in healthcare settings until more evidence on surgical and medical masks is accrued. This study highlights a substantial lack of evidence on the comparative effectiveness of mask types in community settings.",Kim MS; Seong D; Li H; Chung SK; Park Y; Lee M; Lee SW; Yon DK; Kim JH; Lee KH; Solmi M; Dragioti E; Koyanagi A; Jacob L; Kronbichler A; Tizaoui K; Cargnin S; Terrazzino S; Hong SH; Abou Ghayda R; Radua J; Oh H; Kostev K; Ogino S; Lee IM; Giovannucci E; Barnett Y; Butler L; McDermott D; Ilie PC; Shin JI; Smith L,Reviews in medical virology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35218279/,0,1,0,0,0,0
35201488,Serine and one-carbon metabolisms bring new therapeutic venues in prostate cancer.,"Serine and one-carbon unit metabolisms are essential biochemical pathways implicated in fundamental cellular functions such as proliferation, biosynthesis of important anabolic precursors and in general for the availability of methyl groups. These two distinct but interacting pathways are now becoming crucial in cancer, the de novo cytosolic serine pathway and the mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism. Apart from their role in physiological conditions, such as epithelial proliferation, the serine metabolism alterations are associated to several highly neoplastic proliferative pathologies. Accordingly, prostate cancer shows a deep rearrangement of its metabolism, driven by the dependency from the androgenic stimulus. Several new experimental evidence describes the role of a few of the enzymes involved in the serine metabolism in prostate cancer pathogenesis. The aim of this study is to analyze gene and protein expression data publicly available from large cancer specimens dataset, in order to further dissect the potential role of the abovementioned metabolism in the complex reshaping of the anabolic environment in this kind of neoplasm. The data suggest a potential role as biomarkers as well as in cancer therapy for the genes (and enzymes) belonging to the one-carbon metabolism in the context of prostatic cancer.",Ganini C; Amelio I; Bertolo R; Candi E; Cappello A; Cipriani C; Mauriello A; Marani C; Melino G; Montanaro M; Natale ME; Tisone G; Shi Y; Wang Y; Bove P,Discover oncology,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35201488/,1,0,0,0,0,0

While many studies of pure naringenin and naringin and their food sources have shown beneficial health effects, including improved lipid metabolism, in animals and humans, the mechanisms underlying the lipid-lowering effects are not completely understood. In recent years, multiple studies using various in vitro and rodent models have revealed new mechanisms underlying the hypolipidemic effects of naringin and naringenin, including regulation of lipid digestion, reverse cholesterol transport, and low-density lipoprotein receptor expression. In addition, naringin and naringenin show diverse effects in populations with different health conditions, such as obesity and diabetes. Furthermore, a novel naringin and naringenin enriched food source citrus bergamia (bergamot) and other citrus fruits have recently been studied for lipid-lowering effects in animal models and human clinical trials. In this review, we provide an update on recent advances in naringin and naringenin and their enriched food sources on lipid metabolism and underlying mechanisms. Because absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, particularly in the presence of food matrix, impact the bioavailability, which in turn affects the bioactivities of these flavonoids in vivo, we also summarize new findings from the pharmacokinetics studies andthe interplays between the flavanones and gut microbiota.",Yang Y; Trevethan M; Wang S; Zhao L,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35189328/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35181570,International Consensus Recommendations for Eosinophilic Gastrointestinal Disease Nomenclature.,"Substantial heterogeneity in terminology used for eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases (EGIDs), particularly the catchall term ""eosinophilic gastroenteritis,"" limits clinical and research advances. We aimed to achieve an international consensus for standardized EGID nomenclature. This consensus process utilized Delphi methodology. An initial naming framework was proposed and refined in iterative fashion, then assessed in a first round of Delphi voting. Results were discussed in 2 consensus meetings, and the framework was updated and reassessed in a second Delphi vote, with a 70% threshold set for agreement. Of 91 experts participating, 85 (93%) completed the first and 82 (90%) completed the second Delphi surveys. Consensus was reached on all but 2 statements. ""EGID"" was the preferred umbrella term for disorders of gastrointestinal (GI) tract eosinophilic inflammation in the absence of secondary causes (100% agreement). Involved GI tract segments will be named specifically and use an ""Eo"" abbreviation convention: eosinophilic gastritis (now abbreviated EoG), eosinophilic enteritis (EoN), and eosinophilic colitis (EoC). The term ""eosinophilic gastroenteritis"" is no longer preferred as the overall name (96% agreement). When &gt;2 GI tract areas are involved, the name should reflect all of the involved areas. This international process resulted in consensus for updated EGID nomenclature for both clinical and research use. EGID will be the umbrella term, rather than ""eosinophilic gastroenteritis,"" and specific naming conventions by location of GI tract involvement are recommended.

Previous studies have focused on i) tracking pollution sources in HM-contaminated soils, ii) exploring the adsorption capacity and distribution of HMs, and iii) assessing phyto-uptake of HMs and their ecotoxicity. However, few reviews have systematically summarized HM pollution in soil-plant systems over the past decade. Understanding the mechanisms of interaction between HMs and solid soil components is consequently key to effectively controlling and remediating HM pollution. However, the compositions of solid soil phases are diverse, their structures are complex, and their spatial arrangements are heterogeneous, all leading to the formation of soil micro-domains that exhibit different particle sizes and surface properties. The various soil components and their interactions ultimately control the speciation, transformation, and bioavailability of HMs in soils. Over the past few decades, the extensive application of advanced instrumental techniques and methods has greatly expanded our understanding of the behavior of HMs in organic mineral assemblages. In this review, studies investigating the immobilization of HMs by minerals, organic compounds, microorganisms, and their associated complexes are summarized, with a particular emphasis on the interfacial adsorption and immobilization of HMs. In addition, methods for analyzing the speciation and distribution of HMs in aggregates of natural soils with different particle sizes are also discussed. Moreover, we also review the methods for speciating HMs at mineral-organic micro-scale interfaces. Lastly, developmental prospects for HM research at inorganic-organic interfaces are outlined. In future research, the most advanced methods should be used to characterize the interfaces and in situ characteristics of metals and metal complexes. In particular, the roles and contributions of microorganisms in the immobilization of HMs at complex mineral-organic interfaces require significant further investigation.",Li Q; Wang Y; Li Y; Li L; Tang M; Hu W; Chen L; Ai S,The Science of the total environment,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35176361/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35175880,Tuberculosis in children with severe acute malnutrition.,"With growing attention globally to the childhood tuberculosis epidemic after decades of neglect, and with the burden of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) remaining unacceptably high worldwide, the collision of these two diseases is an important focus for improving child health. This review describes the clinical and public health implications of the interplay between tuberculosis and SAM, particularly for children under the age of five, and identifies priority areas for improved programmatic implementation and future research. We reviewed the literature on PubMed and other evidence known to the authors published until August 2021 relevant to this topic. To achieve the World Health Organization's goal of eliminating deaths from childhood tuberculosis and to improve the abysmal outcomes for children with SAM, further research is needed to 1) better understand the epidemiologic connections between child tuberculosis and SAM, 2) improve case finding of tuberculosis in children with SAM, 3) assess unique treatment considerations for tuberculosis when children also have SAM, and 4) ensure tuberculosis and SAM are strongly addressed in decentralized, integrated models of providing primary healthcare to children.",Vonasek BJ; Radtke KK; Vaz P; Buck WC; Chabala C; McCollum ED; Marcy O; Fitzgerald E; Kondwani A; Garcia-Prats AJ,Expert review of respiratory medicine,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35175880/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35140675,Infection in the Developing Brain: The Role of Unique Systemic Immune Vulnerabilities.,"Central nervous system (CNS) infections remain a major burden of pediatric disease associated with significant long-term morbidity due to injury to the developing brain. Children are susceptible to various etiologies of CNS infection partly because of vulnerabilities in their peripheral immune system. Young children are known to have reduced numbers and functionality of innate and adaptive immune cells, poorer production of immune mediators, impaired responses to inflammatory stimuli and depressed antibody activity in comparison to adults. This has implications not only for their response to pathogen invasion, but also for the development of appropriate vaccines and vaccination strategies. Further, pediatric immune characteristics evolve across the span of childhood into adolescence as their broader physiological and hormonal landscape develop. In addition to intrinsic vulnerabilities, children are subject to external factors that impact their susceptibility to infections, including maternal immunity and exposure, and nutrition. In this review we summarize the current evidence for immune characteristics across childhood that render children at risk for CNS infection and introduce the link with the CNS through the modulatory role that the brain has on the immune response. This manuscript lays the foundation from which we explore the specifics of infection and inflammation within the CNS and the consequences to the maturing brain in part two of this review series.",Singh G; Tucker EW; Rohlwink UK,Frontiers in neurology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35140675/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35135866,Next steps for clinical translation of adenosine pathway inhibition in cancer immunotherapy.,"Increasing evidence supports targeting the adenosine pathway in immuno-oncology with several clinical programs directed at adenosine A2 receptor (A2AR, A2BR), CD73 and CD39 in development. Through a cyclic-AMP-mediated intracellular cascade, adenosine shifts the cytokine and cellular profile of the tumor microenvironment away from cytotoxic T cell inflammation toward one of immune tolerance. A perpetuating cycle of tumor cell proliferation, tissue injury, dysregulated angiogenesis, and hypoxia promote adenosine accumulation via ATP catabolism. Adenosine receptor (eg, A2AR, A2BR) stimulation of both the innate and adaptive cellular precursors lead to immunosuppressive phenotypic differentiation. Preclinical work in various tumor models with adenosine receptor inhibition has demonstrated restoration of immune cell function and tumor regression. Given the broad activity but known limitations of anti-programmed cell death protein (PD1) therapy and other checkpoint inhibitors, ongoing studies have sought to augment the successful outcomes of anti-PD1 therapy with combinatorial approaches, particularly adenosine signaling blockade. Preliminary data have demonstrated an optimal safety profile and enhanced overall response rates in several early phase clinical trials with A2AR and more recently CD73 inhibitors. However, beneficial outcomes for both monotherapy and combinations have been mostly lower than expected based on preclinical studies, indicating a need for more nuanced patient selection or biomarker integration that might predict and optimize patient outcomes. In the context of known immuno-oncology biomarkers such as tumor mutational burden and interferon-associated gene expression, a comparison of adenosine-related gene signatures associated with clinical response indicates an underlying biology related to immunosuppression, angiogenesis, and T cell inflammation. Importantly, though, adenosine associated gene expression may point to a unique intratumoral phenotype independent from IFN-γ related pathways. Here, we discuss the cellular and molecular mechanisms of adenosine-mediated immunosuppression, preclinical investigation of adenosine signaling blockade, recent response data from clinical trials with A2AR, CD73, CD39 and PD1/L1 inhibitors, and ongoing development of predictive gene signatures to enhance combinatorial immune-based therapies.",Augustin RC; Leone RD; Naing A; Fong L; Bao R; Luke JJ,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35135866/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We reviewed the currently available literature on coronaviruses. Coronaviruses are a group of enveloped viruses with non-segmented, single-stranded, and positive-sense RNA genomes. Although 13 variation sites in open reading frames have been identified among SARS-CoV-2 strains, no mutation has been observed so far in envelop protein. The origin and structural biology of SARS-CoV-2 in details are discussed. Origin and structural biology will help the researchers identify the virus's mechanism in the host and drug design.

35124837,Beyond lipids: Novel mechanisms for parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease.,"Parenteral nutrition (PN) is a therapy that delivers essential nutrients intravenously to patients who are unable to meet their nutrition requirements via standard enteral feeding. This methodology is often referred to as PN when accompanied by minimal or no enteral nutrition (EN). Although PN is lifesaving, significant complications can arise, such as intestinal failure-associated liver disease and gut-mucosal atrophy. The exact mechanism of injury remains ill defined. This review was designed to explore the available literature related to the drivers of injury mechanisms. The Farnesoid X receptor and fibroblast growth factor 19 signaling pathway seems to play an important role in gut-systemic signaling, and its alteration during PN provides insights into mechanistic links. Central line infections also play a key role in mediating PN-associated injury. Although lipid reduction strategies, as well as the use of multicomponent lipid emulsions and vitamin E, have shown promise, the cornerstone of preventing injury is the early establishment of EN.",Wichman BE; Nilson J; Govindan S; Chen A; Jain A; Arun V; Derdoy J; Krebs J; Jain AK,Nutrition in clinical practice : official publication of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35124837/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35116107,"Development of artificial intelligence technology in diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of colorectal cancer.","Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has made leaps and bounds since its invention. AI technology can be subdivided into many technologies such as machine learning and deep learning. The application scope and prospect of different technologies are also totally different. Currently, AI technologies play a pivotal role in the highly complex and wide-ranging medical field, such as medical image recognition, biotechnology, auxiliary diagnosis, drug research and development, and nutrition. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common gastrointestinal cancer that has a high mortality, posing a serious threat to human health. Many CRCs are caused by the malignant transformation of colorectal polyps. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to CRC prognosis. The methods of diagnosing CRC are divided into imaging diagnosis, endoscopy, and pathology diagnosis. Treatment methods are divided into endoscopic treatment, surgical treatment, and drug treatment. AI technology is in the weak era and does not have communication capabilities. Therefore, the current AI technology is mainly used for image recognition and auxiliary analysis without in-depth communication with patients.

The fourth industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0, has been gaining momentum since 2015, being a significant driver for sustainable development and a successful catalyst to tackle critical global challenges. This review paper summarizes the most relevant food Industry 4.0 technologies including, among others, digital technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, big data analytics, Internet of Things, and blockchain) and other technological advances (e.g., smart sensors, robotics, digital twins, and cyber-physical systems). Moreover, insights into the new food trends (such as 3D printed foods) that have emerged as a result of the Industry 4.0 technological revolution will also be discussed in Part II of this work. The Industry 4.0 technologies have significantly modified the food industry and led to substantial consequences for the environment, economics, and human health. Despite the importance of each of the technologies mentioned above, ground-breaking sustainable solutions could only emerge by combining many technologies simultaneously.

35092417,Food Insecurity among American Indian and Alaska Native People: A Scoping Review to Inform Future Research and Policy Needs.,"Food insecurity, defined as insufficient access to nutritious foods, is a social determinant of health that may underpin health disparities in the US. American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) individuals experience many health inequities that may be related to food insecurity, but no systematic analyses of the existing evidence have been published. Thus, the objective of this scoping review was to assess the literature on food insecurity among AI/AN individuals and communities, with a focus on the prevalence of food insecurity and its relations to sociodemographic, nutrition, and health characteristics. Systematic search and data extraction processes were used. Searches were conducted on PubMed as well as peer-reviewed journal and government websites. Of 3174 identified references, 34 publications describing 30 studies with predominantly AI/AN sample populations were included in the final narrative synthesis. Twenty-two studies (73%) were cross-sectional and the remaining 8 (27%) described interventions. The weighted average prevalence of food insecurity across the studies was 45.7%, although estimates varied from 16% to 80%. Most studies used some version of the USDA Food Security Survey Modules, although evidence supporting its validity in AI/AN respondents is limited. Based on the review, recommendations for future research were derived, which include fundamental validity testing, better representation of AI/AN individuals in federal or local food security reports, and consideration of cultural contexts when selecting methodological approaches. Advances in AI/AN food insecurity research could yield tangible benefits to ongoing initiatives aimed at increasing access to traditional foods, improving food environments on reservations and homelands, and supporting food sovereignty.",Nikolaus CJ; Johnson S; Benally T; Maudrie T; Henderson A; Nelson K; Lane T; Segrest V; Ferguson GL; Buchwald D; Blue Bird Jernigan V; Sinclair KI,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35092417/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35047469,What Are We Measuring When We Evaluate Digital Interventions for Improving Lifestyle? A Scoping Meta-Review.,"<b>Background:</b> Lifestyle Medicine (LM) aims to address six main behavioral domains: diet/nutrition, substance use (SU), physical activity (PA), social relationships, stress management, and sleep. Digital Health Interventions (DHIs) have been used to improve these domains. However, there is no consensus on how to measure lifestyle and its intermediate outcomes aside from measuring each behavior separately. We aimed to describe (1) the most frequent lifestyle domains addressed by DHIs, (2) the most frequent outcomes used to measure lifestyle changes, and (3) the most frequent DHI delivery methods. <b>Methods:</b> We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA-ScR) Extension for Scoping Reviews. A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science for publications since 2010. We included systematic reviews and meta-analyses of clinical trials using DHI to promote health, behavioral, or lifestyle change. <b>Results:</b> Overall, 954 records were identified, and 72 systematic reviews were included. Of those, 35 conducted meta-analyses, 58 addressed diet/nutrition, and 60 focused on PA. Only one systematic review evaluated all six lifestyle domains simultaneously; 1 systematic review evaluated five lifestyle domains; 5 systematic reviews evaluated 4 lifestyle domains; 14 systematic reviews evaluated 3 lifestyle domains; and the remaining 52 systematic reviews evaluated only one or two domains. The most frequently evaluated domains were diet/nutrition and PA. The most frequent DHI delivery methods were smartphone apps and websites. <b>Discussion:</b> The concept of lifestyle is still unclear and fragmented, making it hard to evaluate the complex interconnections of unhealthy behaviors, and their impact on health. Clarifying this concept, refining its operationalization, and defining the reporting guidelines should be considered as the current research priorities. DHIs have the potential to improve lifestyle at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of prevention-but most of them are targeting clinical populations. Although important advances have been made to evaluate DHIs, some of their characteristics, such as the rate at which they become obsolete, will require innovative research designs to evaluate long-term outcomes in health.",Castro R; Ribeiro-Alves M; Oliveira C; Romero CP; Perazzo H; Simjanoski M; Kapciznki F; Balanzá-Martínez V; De Boni RB,Frontiers in public health,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35047469/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Research focused on deciphering mechanisms of virus tolerance in bats has rarely considered the influence of their gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiome. In mammals, GIT microbiomes influence infections through their effect on host physiology, immunity, nutrition, and behavior. Bat GIT microbiomes more closely resemble the Proteobacteria-dominated GIT microbiomes of birds than those of other mammals. As an adaptation to flight, bats have rapid GIT transit times which may reduce the stability of their microbiome, constrain nutrient uptake, and affect pathogen exposure and evolution of tolerance mechanisms. Experimental and longitudinal studies are needed to understand the function of bats' GIT microbiomes and their role in modulating viral infection dynamics.",Jones DN; Ravelomanantsoa NAF; Yeoman CJ; Plowright RK; Brook CE,Trends in microbiology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35034797/,1,0,0,0,0,1

There is mounting evidence demonstrating the importance of nutrition in the development and progression of mental disorders such as depression; however, less is known about the role of nutrition in anxiety disorders. This scoping review sought to systematically map the existing literature on anxiety disorders and nutrition in order to identify associations between dietary factors and anxiety symptoms or disorder prevalence as well as identify gaps and opportunities for further research. The review followed established methodological approaches for scoping reviews. Due to the large volume of results, an online program (Abstrackr) with artificial intelligence features was used. Studies reporting an association between a dietary constituent and anxiety symptoms or disorders were counted and presented in figures. A total of 55,914 unique results were identified. After a full-text review, 1541 articles met criteria for inclusion. Analysis revealed an association between less anxiety and more fruits and vegetables, omega-3 fatty acids, ""healthy"" dietary patterns, caloric restriction, breakfast consumption, ketogenic diet, broad-spectrum micronutrient supplementation, zinc, magnesium and selenium, probiotics, and a range of phytochemicals. Analysis revealed an association between higher levels of anxiety and high-fat diet, inadequate tryptophan and dietary protein, high intake of sugar and refined carbohydrates, and ""unhealthy"" dietary patterns.

34944727,Role of Phytoconstituents as PPAR Agonists: Implications for Neurodegenerative Disorders.,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR-γ, PPAR-α, and PPAR-β/δ) are ligand-dependent nuclear receptors that play a critical role in the regulation of hundreds of genes through their activation. Their expression and targeted activation play an important role in the treatment of a variety of diseases, including neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, diabetes, and cancer. In recent years, several reviews have been published describing the therapeutic potential of PPAR agonists (natural or synthetic) in the disorders listed above; however, no comprehensive report defining the role of naturally derived phytoconstituents as PPAR agonists targeting neurodegenerative diseases has been published. This review will focus on the role of phytoconstituents as PPAR agonists and the relevant preclinical studies and mechanistic insights into their neuroprotective effects. Exemplary research includes flavonoids, fatty acids, cannabinoids, curcumin, genistein, capsaicin, and piperine, all of which have been shown to be PPAR agonists either directly or indirectly.

34895247,"A systematic review of artificial intelligence chatbots for promoting physical activity, healthy diet, and weight loss.","This systematic review aimed to evaluate AI chatbot characteristics, functions, and core conversational capacities and investigate whether AI chatbot interventions were effective in changing physical activity, healthy eating, weight management behaviors, and other related health outcomes. In collaboration with a medical librarian, six electronic bibliographic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, ACM Digital Library, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and IEEE) were searched to identify relevant studies. Only randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental studies were included. Studies were screened by two independent reviewers, and any discrepancy was resolved by a third reviewer. The National Institutes of Health quality assessment tools were used to assess risk of bias in individual studies. We applied the AI Chatbot Behavior Change Model to characterize components of chatbot interventions, including chatbot characteristics, persuasive and relational capacity, and evaluation of outcomes. The database search retrieved 1692 citations, and 9 studies met the inclusion criteria. Of the 9 studies, 4 were randomized controlled trials and 5 were quasi-experimental studies. Five out of the seven studies suggest chatbot interventions are promising strategies in increasing physical activity. In contrast, the number of studies focusing on changing diet and weight status was limited. Outcome assessments, however, were reported inconsistently across the studies. Eighty-nine and thirty-three percent of the studies specified a name and gender (i.e., woman) of the chatbot, respectively. Over half (56%) of the studies used a constrained chatbot (i.e., rule-based), while the remaining studies used unconstrained chatbots that resemble human-to-human communication. Chatbots may improve physical activity, but we were not able to make definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy of chatbot interventions on physical activity, diet, and weight management/loss. Application of AI chatbots is an emerging field of research in lifestyle modification programs and is expected to grow exponentially. Thus, standardization of designing and reporting chatbot interventions is warranted in the near future.

34868255,Artificial Intelligence in Functional Food Ingredient Discovery and Characterisation: A Focus on Bioactive Plant and Food Peptides.,"Scientific research consistently demonstrates that diseases may be delayed, treated, or even prevented and, thereby, health may be maintained with health-promoting functional food ingredients (FFIs). Consumers are increasingly demanding sound information about food, nutrition, nutrients, and their associated health benefits. Consequently, a nutrition industry is being formed around natural foods and FFIs, the economic growth of which is increasingly driven by consumer decisions. Information technology, in particular artificial intelligence (AI), is primed to vastly expand the pool of characterised and annotated FFIs available to consumers, by systematically discovering and characterising natural, efficacious, and safe bioactive ingredients (bioactives) that address specific health needs. However, FFI-producing companies are lagging in adopting AI technology for their ingredient development pipelines for several reasons, resulting in a lack of efficient means for large-scale and high-throughput molecular and functional ingredient characterisation. The arrival of the AI-led technological revolution allows for the comprehensive characterisation and understanding of the universe of FFI molecules, enabling the mining of the food and natural product space in an unprecedented manner. In turn, this expansion of bioactives dramatically increases the repertoire of FFIs available to the consumer, ultimately resulting in bioactives being specifically developed to target unmet health needs.",Doherty A; Wall A; Khaldi N; Kussmann M,Frontiers in genetics,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34868255/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34858472,Omics Technologies to Enhance Plant Based Functional Foods: An Overview.,"Functional foods are natural products of plants that have health benefits beyond necessary nutrition. Functional foods are abundant in fruits, vegetables, spices, beverages and some are found in cereals, millets, pulses and oilseeds. Efforts to identify functional foods in our diet and their beneficial aspects are limited to few crops. Advances in sequencing and availability of different omics technologies have given opportunity to utilize these tools to enhance the functional components of the foods, thus ensuring the nutritional security. Integrated omics approaches including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics coupled with artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches can be used to improve the crops. This review provides insights into omics studies that are carried out to find the active components and crop improvement by enhancing the functional compounds in different plants including cereals, millets, pulses, oilseeds, fruits, vegetables, spices, beverages and medicinal plants. There is a need to characterize functional foods that are being used in traditional medicines, as well as utilization of this knowledge to improve the staple foods in order to tackle malnutrition and hunger more effectively.",Nayak SN; Aravind B; Malavalli SS; Sukanth BS; Poornima R; Bharati P; Hefferon K; Kole C; Puppala N,Frontiers in genetics,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34858472/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34856770,"Nutrition, atherosclerosis, arterial imaging, cardiovascular risk stratification, and manifestations in COVID-19 framework: a narrative review.","<b>Background</b>: Atherosclerosis is the primary cause of the cardiovascular disease (CVD). Several risk factors lead to atherosclerosis, and altered nutrition is one among those. Nutrition has been ignored quite often in the process of CVD risk assessment. Altered nutrition along with carotid ultrasound imaging-driven atherosclerotic plaque features can help in understanding and banishing the problems associated with the late diagnosis of CVD. Artificial intelligence (AI) is another promisingly adopted technology for CVD risk assessment and management. Therefore, we hypothesize that the risk of atherosclerotic CVD can be accurately monitored using carotid ultrasound imaging, predicted using AI-based algorithms, and reduced with the help of proper nutrition. <b>Layout</b>: The review presents a pathophysiological link between nutrition and atherosclerosis by gaining a deep insight into the processes involved at each stage of plaque development. After targeting the causes and finding out results by low-cost, user-friendly, ultrasound-based arterial imaging, it is important to (i) stratify the risks and (ii) monitor them by measuring plaque burden and computing risk score as part of the preventive framework. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based strategies are used to provide efficient CVD risk assessments. Finally, the review presents the role of AI for CVD risk assessment during COVID-19. <b>Conclusions</b>: By studying the mechanism of low-density lipoprotein formation, saturated and trans fat, and other dietary components that lead to plaque formation, we demonstrate the use of CVD risk assessment due to nutrition and atherosclerosis disease formation during normal and COVID times. Further, nutrition if included, as a part of the associated risk factors can benefit from atherosclerotic disease progression and its management using AI-based CVD risk assessment.",Munjral S; Ahluwalia P; Jamthikar AD; Puvvula A; Saba L; Faa G; Singh IM; Chadha PS; Turk M; Johri AM; Khanna NN; Viskovic K; Mavrogeni S; Laird JR; Pareek G; Miner M; Sobel DW; Balestrieri A; Sfikakis PP; Tsoulfas G; Protogerou A; Misra P; Agarwal V; Kitas GD; Kolluri R; Teji J; Al-Maini M; Dhanjil SK; Sockalingam M; Saxena A; Sharma A; Rathore V; Fatemi M; Alizad A; Viswanathan V; Krishnan PK; Omerzu T; Naidu S; Nicolaides A; Suri JS,Frontiers in bioscience (Landmark edition),2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34856770/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34843665,"The role of growth and nutrition in the early origins of spirometric restriction in adult life: a longitudinal, multicohort, population-based study.","Spirometric restriction, defined as a reduced forced vital capacity (FVC) with a preserved FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio, is associated with increased respiratory and non-respiratory comorbidities and all-cause mortality in adulthood. Little is known about the early origins of this condition. We sought to identify early-life risk factors for spirometric restriction in adult life. In this longitudinal, multicohort, population-based study, we used data from the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study (TCRS), which recruited 1246 healthy infants at birth between April 1980, and October 1984, in Tucson, AZ, USA. Questionnaires were answered by the primary caregiver at enrolment, immediately after the child's birth, and multiple follow-up questionnaires were completed through childhood and adulthood. At the age of 22, 26, 32, and 36 years, lung function was measured with spirometry. At each survey, three mutually exclusive spirometric patterns were defined: (1) normal (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ≥10th percentile and FVC ≥10th percentile); (2) restrictive (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ≥10th percentile and FVC <10th percentile); and (3) obstructive (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC <10th percentile, independent of FVC). Data on demographic features and parental health factors were collected from questionnaires; pregnancy and perinatal data (including nutritional problems) and birth measurements were obtained from medical records; and weight, height, and body-mass index (BMI) during childhood (age 6-16 years) were measured by study nurses. The associations between early-life risk factors and spirometric patterns were assessed by multivariate multinomial logistic regression analysis, adjusted for survey year, sex, and race-ethnicity. Significant risk factors were further tested for replication in the Swedish Child (Barn), Allergy, Milieu, Stockholm, Epidemiological (BAMSE; n=1817; spirometry surveys were done at age 24 years) survey and the UK Manchester Asthma and Allergy Study (MAAS; n=411; spirometry surveys were done at age 18 years) birth cohorts, and fixed-effect meta-analyses of relative risk ratios (RRRs) from multinomial logistic regression models were done to generate a pooled estimate of the effect across the three cohorts. Measurements of body composition (MAAS; n=365) and total lung capacity (TCRS; n=173 and MAAS; n=407) were also available for a subset of participants. Of 1246 healthy infants included in TCRS, for the present study we included data for 652 participants who had at least one set of spirometry data, contributing up to 1668 observations. In the TCRS cohort, results from the multivariate models showed that maternal nutritional problems during pregnancy (RRR 2·48 [95% CI 1·30-4·76]; p=0·0062), being born small for gestational age (birthweight <10th percentile; 3·26 [1·34-7·93]; p=0·0093), and being underweight in childhood (BMI-for-age <5th percentile; 3·54 [1·35-9·26]; p=0·010) were independent predictors of spirometric restriction in adult life. Associations between being small for gestational age (p=0·0028) and underweight in childhood (p<0·0001) with adult spirometric restriction were supported by the results of meta-analysis of data from all three cohorts. In the MAAS cohort, having a low lean BMI (ie, <10th percentile) at age 11 years predicted adult (age 18 years) spirometric restriction (RRR 3·66 [1·48-9·02]; p=0·0048). These associations of spirometric restriction with small for gestational age, childhood underweight, and low lean BMI in childhood were verified in participants with spirometric restriction who had diminished total lung capacity, indicating that these factors specifically increase the risk of lung restriction. Poor growth and nutritional deficits in utero and throughout childhood precede and predict the development of spirometric restriction in adult life. Strategies to improve prenatal and childhood growth trajectories could help to prevent spirometric restriction and its associated morbidity and mortality burden.

34836203,A Multidisciplinary Perspective of Ultra-Processed Foods and Associated Food Processing Technologies: A View of the Sustainable Road Ahead.,"Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are negatively perceived by part of the scientific community, the public, and policymakers alike, to the extent they are sometimes referred to as not ""real food"". Many observational surveys have linked consumption of UPFs to adverse health outcomes. This narrative synthesis and scientific reappraisal of available evidence aims to: (i) critically evaluate UPF-related scientific literature on diet and disease and identify possible research gaps or biases in the interpretation of data; (ii) emphasize the innovative potential of various processing technologies that can lead to modifications of the food matrix with beneficial health effects; (iii) highlight the possible links between processing, sustainability and circular economy through the valorisation of by-products; and (iv) delineate the conceptual parameters of new paradigms in food evaluation and classification systems. Although greater consumption of UPFs has been associated with obesity, unfavorable cardiometabolic risk factor profiles, and increased risk for non-communicable diseases, whether specific food processing techniques leading to ultra-processed formulations are responsible for the observed links between UPFs and various health outcomes remains elusive and far from being understood. Evolving technologies can be used in the context of sustainable valorisation of food processing by-products to create novel, low-cost UPFs with improved nutritional value and health potential. New paradigms of food evaluation and assessment should be funded and developed on several novel pillars-enginomics, signalling, and precision nutrition-taking advantage of available digital technologies and artificial intelligence. Research is needed to generate required scientific knowledge to either expand the current or create new food evaluation and classification systems, incorporating processing aspects that may have a significant impact on health and wellness, together with factors related to the personalization of foods and diets, while not neglecting recycling and sustainability aspects.

Oxidative stress, DNA dysfunction, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, along with the release of cytochrome c are some of these theories. Diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, intestinal dysfunction, cardiovascular diseases, hepatic injury, and even cancer develop with age and eventually cause death. Ulva polysaccharides, owing to their special structures and various functions, have emerged as desirable materials for keeping healthy. These polysaccharide structures are found to be closely related to the extraction methods, seaweed strains, and culture conditions. Ulvan is a promising bioactive substance, a potential functional food, which can regulate immune cells to augment inflammation, control the activity of aging-related genes, promote tumor senescence, enhance mitochondrial function, maintain liver balance, and protect the gut microbiome from inflammatory attacks.

34771658,Scope of Artificial Intelligence in Gastrointestinal Oncology.,"Gastrointestinal cancers are among the leading causes of death worldwide, with over 2.8 million deaths annually. Over the last few decades, advancements in artificial intelligence technologies have led to their application in medicine. The use of artificial intelligence in endoscopic procedures is a significant breakthrough in modern medicine. Currently, the diagnosis of various gastrointestinal cancer relies on the manual interpretation of radiographic images by radiologists and various endoscopic images by endoscopists. This can lead to diagnostic variabilities as it requires concentration and clinical experience in the field. Artificial intelligence using machine or deep learning algorithms can provide automatic and accurate image analysis and thus assist in diagnosis. In the field of gastroenterology, the application of artificial intelligence can be vast from diagnosis, predicting tumor histology, polyp characterization, metastatic potential, prognosis, and treatment response. It can also provide accurate prediction models to determine the need for intervention with computer-aided diagnosis. The number of research studies on artificial intelligence in gastrointestinal cancer has been increasing rapidly over the last decade due to immense interest in the field. This review aims to review the impact, limitations, and future potentials of artificial intelligence in screening, diagnosis, tumor staging, treatment modalities, and prediction models for the prognosis of various gastrointestinal cancers.",Goyal H; Sherazi SAA; Mann R; Gandhi Z; Perisetti A; Aziz M; Chandan S; Kopel J; Tharian B; Sharma N; Thosani N,Cancers,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34771658/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34763180,The gut virome in inflammatory bowel diseases.,"Dysbiosis of the microbiome has been extensively studied in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The roles of bacteria and fungi have been studied in detail, but viral communities, an important component of the microbiome, have been less thoroughly investigated. Metagenomics provided a way to fill this gap by using DNA sequencing to enumerate all viruses in a sample, termed the 'virome'. Such methods have now been employed in several studies to assess associations between viral communities and IBD, yielding several commonly seen properties, including an increase in tailed bacteriophage (Caudovirales) and a decrease in the spherical Microviridae. Numerous studies of single human viruses have been carried out, but no one virus has emerged as tightly associated, focusing attention on whole virome communities and further factors. This review provides an overview of research on the human virome in IBD, with emphasis on (1) dynamics of the gut virome, (2) candidate mechanisms of virome alterations with disease, (3) methods for studying the virome, and (4) potentially actionable implications of virome data.",Liang G; Cobián-Güemes AG; Albenberg L; Bushman F,Current opinion in virology,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34763180/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34753490,The effectiveness of digital interventions for increasing physical activity in individuals of low socioeconomic status: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Digital technologies such as wearables, websites and mobile applications are increasingly used in interventions targeting physical activity (PA). Increasing access to such technologies makes an attractive prospect for helping individuals of low socioeconomic status (SES) in becoming more active and healthier. However, little is known about their effectiveness in such populations. The aim of this systematic review was to explore whether digital interventions were effective in promoting PA in low SES populations, whether interventions are of equal benefit to higher SES individuals and whether the number or type of behaviour change techniques (BCTs) used in digital PA interventions was associated with intervention effects. A systematic search strategy was used to identify eligible studies from MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus and The Cochrane Library, published between January 1990 and March 2020. Randomised controlled trials, using digital technology as the primary intervention tool, and a control group that did not receive any digital technology-based intervention were included, provided they had a measure of PA as an outcome. Lastly, studies that did not have any measure of SES were excluded from the review. Risk of Bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool version 2. Of the 14,589 records initially identified, 19 studies were included in the final meta-analysis. Using random-effects models, in low SES there was a standardised mean difference (SMD (95%CI)) in PA between intervention and control groups of 0.06 (- 0.08,0.20). In high SES the SMD was 0.34 (0.22,0.45). Heterogeneity was modest in both low (I<sup>2</sup> = 0.18) and high (I<sup>2</sup> = 0) SES groups. The studies used a range of digital technologies and BCTs in their interventions, but the main findings were consistent across all of the sub-group analyses (digital interventions with a PA only focus, country, chronic disease, and duration of intervention) and there was no association with the number or type of BCTs. Digital interventions targeting PA do not show equivalent efficacy for people of low and high SES. For people of low SES, there is no evidence that digital PA interventions are effective, irrespective of the behaviour change techniques used. In contrast, the same interventions in high SES participants do indicate effectiveness. To reduce inequalities and improve effectiveness, future development of digital interventions aimed at improving PA must make more effort to meet the needs of low SES people within the target population.",Western MJ; Armstrong MEG; Islam I; Morgan K; Jones UF; Kelson MJ,The international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34753490/,0,1,0,1,0,0
34749301,Vitamin B12 and gut-brain homeostasis in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke.,"Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It inflicts immeasurable suffering on patients and their loved ones and carries an immense social cost. Efforts to mitigate the impact of stroke have focused on identifying therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome represents one such potential target given its multifaceted effects on conditions known to cause and worsen the severity of stroke. Vitamin B12 (VB12) serves as a cofactor for two enzymes, methylmalonyl-CoA synthase and methionine synthase, vital for methionine and nucleotide biosynthesis. VB12 deficiency results in a buildup of metabolic substrates, such as homocysteine, that alter immune homeostasis and contribute to atherosclerotic disorders, including ischemic stroke. In addition to its support of cellular function, VB12 serves as a metabolic cofactor for gut microbes. By shaping microbial communities, VB12 further impacts local and peripheral immunity. Growing evidence suggests that gut dysbiosis-related immune dysfunction induced by VB12 deficiency may potentially contributes to stroke pathogenesis, its severity, and patient outcomes. In this review, we discuss the complex interactions of VB12, gut microbes and the associated metabolites, and immune homeostasis throughout the natural history of ischemic stroke.",Roth W; Mohamadzadeh M,EBioMedicine,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34749301/,1,0,0,0,0,0

34679854,The Quest for Genes Involved in Adaptation to Climate Change in Ruminant Livestock.,"Livestock radiated out from domestication centres to most regions of the world, gradually adapting to diverse environments, from very hot to sub-zero temperatures and from wet and humid conditions to deserts. The climate is changing; generally global temperature is increasing, although there are also more extreme cold periods, storms, and higher solar radiation. These changes impact livestock welfare and productivity. This review describes advances in the methodology for studying livestock genomes and the impact of the environment on animal production, giving examples of discoveries made. Sequencing livestock genomes has facilitated genome-wide association studies to localize genes controlling many traits, and population genetics has identified genomic regions under selection or introgressed from one breed into another to improve production or facilitate adaptation. Landscape genomics, which combines global positioning and genomics, has identified genomic features that enable animals to adapt to local environments. Combining the advances in genomics and methods for predicting changes in climate is generating an explosion of data which calls for innovations in the way big data sets are treated.

34644609,Vaginal ring acceptability: A systematic review and meta-analysis of vaginal ring experiences from around the world.,"The vaginal ring (ring) is a female-initiated, long-acting drug delivery system for different indications, including HIV prevention. Our aim was to provide evidence for acceptability of the vaginal ring across indications to support dapivirine and multipurpose prevention technology ring introduction and roll out. This systematic review and meta-analysis followed PRISMA guidelines. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and grey literature for publications reporting favorable ring acceptability and secondary outcomes involving actual ring use (comfort, ease of ring use, ring comfort during sex, expulsions, and vaginal symptoms) or hypothetical acceptability for any indication published January 1, 1970-June 15, 2021. We estimated random-effects pooled prevalence, assessing between-study variation using meta-regression. Of 2,234 records, we included 123 studies with 40,434 actual and hypothetical ring users. The primary outcome assessment included 50 studies with 60 ring subgroups totaling 19,271 ring users. The favorable acceptability pooled prevalence was 85.6% (95%CI 81.3, 89.0), while hypothetical acceptability among non-ring users was 27.6% (95%CI 17.5, 40.5). In meta-regression, acceptability was higher in menopause (95.4%; 95%CI 88.4, 98.2) compared to contraceptive rings (83.7%; 95%CI 75.6, 89.5). Acceptability was lower in pharmacokinetic studies (50%; 95%CI 22.1, 77.9) compared to RCTs (89.5%; 95%CI 85.8.92.4) and in studies assessing acceptability at ≥12 months (78.5%; 95%CI 66.5, 87.1) versus studies assessing acceptability at <3 months (91.9%; 95%CI 83.7, 96.1). European (90.6%; 95%CI 83.9, 94.7), Asian (97.1%; 95%CI 92.0, 99.0), and multi-region studies (93.5%; 95%CI 84.6, 97.4) reported more favorable acceptability compared to African studies (59.4%; 95%CI 38.3, 77.5). Secondary outcomes were similarly favorable, including ring comfort (92.9%; 95%CI 89.2, 95.4), ease of use (90.9%; 95%CI 86.5, 94.0), and comfort during sex (82.7%; 95%CI 76.4, 87.6). Limitations include inconsistent outcome definitions and unmeasured factors affecting acceptability. Women who used vaginal rings reported they were acceptable across indications geographic regions and indications. Policy makers should consider the ring as an important option for pregnancy and HIV prevention drug development. This review found favorable acceptability among vaginal ring users across indications and geographic areas, in contrast to low hypothetical acceptability among non-users.

34609446,Eosinophilic Esophagitis: A Review.,"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease of the esophagus that affects an estimated 34.4/100 000 people in Europe and North America. EoE affects both children and adults, and causes dysphagia, food impaction of the esophagus, and esophageal strictures. EoE is defined by symptoms of esophageal dysfunction, such as vomiting, dysphagia, or feeding difficulties, in a patient with an esophageal biopsy demonstrating at least 15 eosinophils per high-power field in the absence of other conditions associated with esophageal eosinophilia such as gastroesophageal reflux disease or achalasia. Genetic factors and environmental factors, such as exposure to antibiotics early in life, are associated with EoE. Current therapies include proton pump inhibitors; topical steroid preparations, such as fluticasone and budesonide; dietary therapy with amino acid formula or empirical food elimination; and endoscopic dilation. In a systematic review of observational studies that included 1051 patients with EoE, proton pump inhibitor therapy was associated with a histologic response, defined as less than 15 eosinophils per high-power field on endoscopic biopsy, in 41.7% of patients, while placebo was associated with a 13.3% response rate. In a systematic review of 8 randomized trials of 437 patients with EoE, topical corticosteroid treatment was associated with histologic remission in 64.9% of patients compared with 13.3% for placebo. Patients with esophageal narrowing may require dilation. Objective assessment of therapeutic response typically requires endoscopy with biopsy. EoE has a prevalence of approximately 34.4/100 000 worldwide. Treatments consist of proton pump inhibitors, topical steroids, elemental diet, and empirical food elimination, with esophageal dilation reserved for patients with symptomatic esophageal narrowing.",Muir A; Falk GW,JAMA,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34609446/,1,0,0,0,0,0

34581311,Current models of apolipoprotein A-I lipidation by adenosine triphosphate binding cassette transporter A1.,"The primary cardioprotective function of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) is to remove excess cellular free cholesterol (FC) from peripheral tissues and deliver it to the liver. Here, we summarize recent research that examines apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) lipidation models by adenosine triphosphate binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and discuss its relevance in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The first step in HDL formation involves the interaction between apoA-I and ABCA1, where ABCA1 mediates the removal of FC and phospholipids from lipid-laden macrophages to form discoidal nascent HDL (nHDL). However, there are currently no clear-cut systematic models that characterize HDL formation. A number of recent studies have investigated the importance of apoA-I C- and N-terminal domains required for optimal cholesterol efflux and nHDL production. Furthermore, functional ABCA1 is required for direct or indirect binding to apoA-I where ABCA1 dimer-monomer interconversion facilitates apoA-I lipidation from plasma membrane microdomains. Microparticles are also another lipid source for apoA-I solubilization into nHDL. ApoA-I and ABCA1 are key factors in macrophage-mediated cholesterol efflux and nHDL production. Understanding of the key steps in HDL formation may unlock the therapeutic potential of HDL and improve clinical management of ASCVD.",Hafiane A; Gianopoulos I; Sorci-Thomas MG; Daskalopoulou SS,Current opinion in lipidology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34581311/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34579120,Dietary Glycaemic Index Labelling: A Global Perspective.,"The glycaemic index (GI) is a food metric that ranks the acute impact of available (digestible) carbohydrates on blood glucose. At present, few countries regulate the inclusion of GI on food labels even though the information may assist consumers to manage blood glucose levels. Australia and New Zealand regulate GI claims as nutrition content claims and also recognize the GI Foundation's certified Low GI trademark as an endorsement. The GI Foundation of South Africa endorses foods with low, medium and high GI symbols. In Asia, Singapore's Healthier Choice Symbol has specific provisions for low GI claims. Low GI claims are also permitted on food labels in India. In China, there are no national regulations specific to GI; however, voluntary claims are permitted. In the USA, GI claims are not specifically regulated but are permitted, as they are deemed to fall under general food-labelling provisions. In Canada and the European Union, GI claims are not legal under current food law. Inconsistences in food regulation around the world undermine consumer and health professional confidence and call for harmonization. Global provisions for GI claims/endorsements in food standard codes would be in the best interests of people with diabetes and those at risk.",Barclay AW; Augustin LSA; Brighenti F; Delport E; Henry CJ; Sievenpiper JL; Usic K; Yuexin Y; Zurbau A; Wolever TMS; Astrup A; Bulló M; Buyken A; Ceriello A; Ellis PR; Vanginkel MA; Kendall CWC; La Vecchia C; Livesey G; Poli A; Riccardi G; Salas-Salvadó J; Trichopoulou A; Bhaskaran K; Jenkins DJA; Willett WC; Brand-Miller JC,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34579120/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34529222,Modulation of endothelium function by fatty acids.,"The endothelium acts as the barrier that prevents circulating lipids such as lipoproteins and fatty acids into the arterial wall; it also regulates normal functioning in the circulatory system by balancing vasodilation and vasoconstriction, modulating the several responses and signals. Plasma lipids can interact with endothelium via different mechanisms and produce different phenotypes. Increased plasma-free fatty acids (FFAs) levels are associated with the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Because of the multi-dimensional roles of plasma FFAs in mediating endothelial dysfunction, increased FFA level is now considered an essential link in the onset of endothelial dysfunction in CVD. FFA-mediated endothelial dysfunction involves several mechanisms, including dysregulated production of nitric oxide and cytokines, metaflammation, oxidative stress, inflammation, activation of the renin-angiotensin system, and apoptosis. Therefore, modulation of FFA-mediated pathways involved in endothelial dysfunction may prevent the complications associated with CVD risk. This review presents details as to how endothelium is affected by FFAs involving several metabolic pathways.",Mallick R; Duttaroy AK,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34529222/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34525321,Artificial intelligence in nutrition research: perspectives on current and future applications.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving area that offers unparalleled opportunities of progress and applications in many healthcare fields. In this review, we provide an overview of the main and latest applications of AI in nutrition research and identify gaps to address to potentialize this emerging field. AI algorithms may help better understand and predict the complex and non-linear interactions between nutrition-related data and health outcomes, particularly when large amounts of data need to be structured and integrated, such as in metabolomics. AI-based approaches, including image recognition, may also improve dietary assessment by maximizing efficiency and addressing systematic and random errors associated with self-reported measurements of dietary intakes. Finally, AI applications can extract, structure and analyze large amounts of data from social media platforms to better understand dietary behaviours and perceptions among the population. In summary, AI-based approaches will likely improve and advance nutrition research as well as help explore new applications. However, further research is needed to identify areas where AI does deliver added value compared with traditional approaches, and other areas where AI is simply not likely to advance the field. <b>Novelty:</b> Artificial intelligence offers unparalleled opportunities of progress and applications in nutrition. There remain gaps to address to potentialize this emerging field.",Côté M.; Lamarche B.,"Applied physiology, nutrition, and metabolism = Physiologie appliquee, nutrition et metabolisme",2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34525321/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34524200,Bacteriophages against enteropathogens: rediscovery and refinement of novel antimicrobial therapeutics.,"Alarming rates of antibiotic resistance in bacteria and gastrointestinal dysbiosis associated with traditional antimicrobial therapy have led to renewed interests in developing bacteriophages as novel therapeutics. In this review, we highlight some of the recent advances in bacteriophage therapeutic development targeting important enteropathogens of the gastrointestinal tract. Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria, either to utilize the bacterial machinery to produce new progeny or stably integrate into the bacterial chromosome to ensure maintenance of the viral genome. With recent advances in synthetic biology and the discovery of CRISPR-Cas systems used by bacteria to protect against bacteriophages, novel molecular applications are taking us beyond the discovery of bacteriophages and toward innovative applications, including the targeting of bacterial virulence factors, the use of temperate bacteriophages, and the production of bacteriophage proteins as antimicrobial agents. These technologies offer promise to target enteropathogens without disrupting the healthy microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, the use of nanoparticle technology and other modifications are helping researchers circumvent the harsh gastrointestinal conditions that could limit the efficacy of bacteriophages against enteric pathogens. This era of discovery and development offers significant potential to modify bacteriophages and overcome the global impact of enteropathogens.",León Y; Faherty CS,Current opinion in infectious diseases,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34524200/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34503987,Maternal diet in pregnancy and child's respiratory outcomes: an individual participant data meta-analysis of 18 000 children.,"Severe fetal malnutrition has been related to an increased risk of respiratory diseases later in life, but evidence for the association of a suboptimal diet during pregnancy with respiratory outcomes in childhood is conflicting. We aimed to examine whether a pro-inflammatory or low-quality maternal diet during pregnancy was associated with child's respiratory health. We performed an individual participant meta-analysis among 18 326 mother-child pairs from seven European birth cohorts. Maternal pro-inflammatory and low-quality diets were estimated by energy-adjusted Dietary Inflammatory Index (E-DII) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores. Preschool wheezing and school-age asthma were measured using questionnaires and lung function by spirometry. After adjustment for lifestyle and sociodemographic factors, we observed that a higher maternal E-DII score (a more pro-inflammatory diet) during pregnancy was associated only with a lower forced vital capacity (FVC) in children (z-score difference -0.05, 95% CI -0.08- -0.02, per interquartile range increase). No linear associations of the maternal E-DII or DASH score with child's wheezing or asthma were observed. In an exploratory examination of the extremes, a very low DASH score (<10th percentile) (a very low dietary quality) was associated with an increased risk of preschool wheezing and a low forced expiratory volume in 1 s/FVC (z-score <-1.64) (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.06-1.36 and z-score difference 1.40, 95% CI 1.06-1.85, compared to ≥10th percentile), with corresponding population attributable risk fractions of 1.7% and 3.3%, respectively. The main results from this individual participant data meta-analysis do not support the hypothesis that maternal pro-inflammatory or low-quality diet in pregnancy are related to respiratory diseases in childhood.",Mensink-Bout SM; van Meel ER; de Jongste JC; Annesi-Maesano I; Aubert AM; Bernard JY; Chen LW; Cooper C; Crozier SR; Hanke W; Harvey NC; Hébert JR; Heude B; Jerzynska J; Kelleher CC; Mehegan J; McAuliffe FM; Phillips CM; Polanska K; Relton CL; Shivappa N; Suderman M; Jaddoe VWV; Duijts L,The European respiratory journal,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34503987/,0,0,0,1,0,0
34494363,Are fatty nuts a weighty concern? A systematic review and meta-analysis and dose-response meta-regression of prospective cohorts and randomized controlled trials.,"Nuts are recommended for cardiovascular health, yet concerns remain that nuts may contribute to weight gain due to their high energy density. A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohorts and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to update the evidence, provide a dose-response analysis, and assess differences in nut type, comparator and more in subgroup analyses. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane were searched, along with manual searches. Data from eligible studies were pooled using meta-analysis methods. Interstudy heterogeneity was assessed (Cochran Q statistic) and quantified (I<sup>2</sup> statistic). Certainty of the evidence was assessed by Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). Six prospective cohort studies (7 unique cohorts, n = 569,910) and 86 RCTs (114 comparisons, n = 5873) met eligibility criteria. Nuts were associated with lower incidence of overweight/obesity (RR 0.93 [95% CI 0.88 to 0.98] P < 0.001, ""moderate"" certainty of evidence) in prospective cohorts. RCTs presented no adverse effect of nuts on body weight (MD 0.09 kg, [95% CI -0.09 to 0.27 kg] P < 0.001, ""high"" certainty of evidence). Meta-regression showed that higher nut intake was associated with reductions in body weight and body fat.

34466676,"Arginine metabolism and its functions in growth, nutrient utilization, and immunonutrition of fish.","Fish have limited ability in endogenous biosynthesis of arginine. Arginine is an indispensable amino acid for fish, and the arginine requirement varies with fish species and fish size. Recent studies on fish have demonstrated that arginine influences nutrient metabolism, stimulates insulin release, is involved in nonspecific immune responses and antioxidant responses, and elevates disease resistance. Specifically, arginine can regulate energy homeostasis via modulating the adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, and also regulate protein synthesis via activating the target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway. The present article reviews pertinent knowledge of arginine in fish, including dietary quantitative requirements, endogenous anabolism and catabolism, regulation of the endocrine and metabolic systems, and immune-regulatory functions under pathogenic challenge. Our findings showed that further data about the distribution of arginine after intake into specific cells, its sub-cellular sensor to initiate downstream signaling pathways, and its effects on fish mucosal immunity, especially the adaptive immune response against pathogenic infection in different species, are urgently needed.",Wang Q; Xu Z; Ai Q,Animal nutrition (Zhongguo xu mu shou yi xue hui),2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34466676/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34454714,AGA Clinical Practice Update on the Diagnosis and Management of Atrophic Gastritis: Expert Review.,"The purpose of this Clinical Practice Update Expert Review is to provide clinicians with guidance on the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis, a common preneoplastic condition of the stomach, with a primary focus on atrophic gastritis due to chronic Helicobacter pylori infection-the most common etiology-or due to autoimmunity. To date, clinical guidance for best practices related to the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis remains very limited in the United States, which leads to poor recognition of this preneoplastic condition and suboptimal risk stratification. In addition, there is heterogeneity in the definitions of atrophic gastritis, autoimmune gastritis, pernicious anemia, and gastric neoplasia in the literature, which has led to confusion in clinical practice and research. Accordingly, the primary objective of this Clinical Practice Update is to provide clinicians with a framework for the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis. By focusing on atrophic gastritis, this Clinical Practice Update is intended to complement the 2020 American Gastroenterological Association Institute guidelines on the management of gastric intestinal metaplasia. These recent guidelines did not specifically discuss the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis. Providers should recognize, however, that a diagnosis of intestinal metaplasia on gastric histopathology implies the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis because intestinal metaplasia occurs in underlying atrophic mucosa, although this is often not distinctly noted on histopathologic reports. Nevertheless, atrophic gastritis represents an important stage with distinct histopathologic alterations in the multistep cascade of gastric cancer pathogenesis. The Best Practice Advice statements presented herein were developed from a combination of available evidence from published literature and consensus-based expert opinion. No formal rating of the strength or quality of the evidence was carried out. These statements are meant to provide practical advice to clinicians practicing in the United States. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Atrophic gastritis is defined as the loss of gastric glands, with or without metaplasia, in the setting of chronic inflammation mainly due to Helicobacter pylori infection or autoimmunity. Regardless of the etiology, the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis should be confirmed by histopathology. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Providers should be aware that the presence of intestinal metaplasia on gastric histology almost invariably implies the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis. There should be a coordinated effort between gastroenterologists and pathologists to improve the consistency of documenting the extent and severity of atrophic gastritis, particularly if marked atrophy is present. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Providers should recognize typical endoscopic features of atrophic gastritis, which include pale appearance of gastric mucosa, increased visibility of vasculature due to thinning of the gastric mucosa, and loss of gastric folds, and, if with concomitant intestinal metaplasia, light blue crests and white opaque fields. Because these mucosal changes are often subtle, techniques to optimize evaluation of the gastric mucosa should be performed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: When endoscopic features of atrophic gastritis are present, providers should assess the extent endoscopically. Providers should obtain biopsies from the suspected atrophic/metaplastic areas for histopathological confirmation and risk stratification; at a minimum, biopsies from the body and antrum/incisura should be obtained and placed in separately labeled jars. Targeted biopsies should additionally be obtained from any other mucosal abnormalities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: In patients with histology compatible with autoimmune gastritis, providers should consider checking antiparietal cell antibodies and anti-intrinsic factor antibodies to assist with the diagnosis. Providers should also evaluate for anemia due to vitamin B-12 and iron deficiencies. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: All individuals with atrophic gastritis should be assessed for H pylori infection. If positive, treatment of H pylori should be administered and successful eradication should be confirmed using nonserological testing modalities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: The optimal endoscopic surveillance interval for patients with atrophic gastritis is not well-defined and should be decided based on individual risk assessment and shared decision making. A surveillance endoscopy every 3 years should be considered in individuals with advanced atrophic gastritis, defined based on anatomic extent and histologic grade. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: The optimal surveillance interval for individuals with autoimmune gastritis is unclear. Interval endoscopic surveillance should be considered based on individualized assessment and shared decision making. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Providers should recognize pernicious anemia as a late-stage manifestation of autoimmune gastritis that is characterized by vitamin B-12 deficiency and macrocytic anemia. Patients with a new diagnosis of pernicious anemia who have not had a recent endoscopy should undergo endoscopy with topographical biopsies to confirm corpus-predominant atrophic gastritis for risk stratification and to rule out prevalent gastric neoplasia, including neuroendocrine tumors. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Individuals with autoimmune gastritis should be screened for type 1 gastric neuroendocrine tumors with upper endoscopy. Small neuroendocrine tumors should be removed endoscopically, followed by surveillance endoscopy every 1-2 years, depending on the burden of neuroendocrine tumors. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Providers should evaluate for iron and vitamin B-12 deficiencies in patients with atrophic gastritis irrespective of etiology, especially if corpus-predominant. Likewise, in patients with unexplained iron or vitamin B-12 deficiency, atrophic gastritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis and appropriate diagnostic evaluation pursued. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: In patients with autoimmune gastritis, providers should recognize that concomitant autoimmune disorders, particularly autoimmune thyroid disease, are common. Screening for autoimmune thyroid disease should be performed.",Shah SC; Piazuelo MB; Kuipers EJ; Li D,Gastroenterology,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34454714/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34450735,Automated Bowel Sound Analysis: An Overview.,"Despite technological progress, we lack a consensus on the method of conducting automated bowel sound (BS) analysis and, consequently, BS tools have not become available to doctors. We aimed to briefly review the literature on BS recording and analysis, with an emphasis on the broad range of analytical approaches. Scientific journals and conference materials were researched with a specific set of terms (Scopus, MEDLINE, IEEE) to find reports on BS. The research articles identified were analyzed in the context of main research directions at a number of centers globally. Automated BS analysis methods were already well developed by the early 2000s. Accuracy of 90% and higher had been achieved with various analytical approaches, including wavelet transformations, multi-layer perceptrons, independent component analysis and autoregressive-moving-average models. Clinical research on BS has exposed their important potential in the non-invasive diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome, in surgery, and for the investigation of gastrointestinal motility. The most recent advances are linked to the application of artificial intelligence and the development of dedicated BS devices. BS research is technologically mature, but lacks uniform methodology, an international forum for discussion and an open platform for data exchange. A common ground is needed as a starting point. The next key development will be the release of freely available benchmark datasets with labels confirmed by human experts.",Nowak JK; Nowak R; Radzikowski K; Grulkowski I; Walkowiak J,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34450735/,1,0,0,0,0,0

COVID-19 is different only in that everyone is encountering it for the first time during this pandemic. The world has gone from complete ignorance to a blitz of details in a matter of months. The foremost challenge that the scientific community faces is to understand the growth and transmission capability of the virus. As the world grapples with the global pandemic, people are spending more time than ever before living and working in the digital milieu, and the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is propelled to an unprecedented level especially as AI has already proven to play an important role in counteracting COVID-19. AI and Data Science are rapidly becoming important tools in clinical research, precision medicine, biomedical discovery and medical diagnostics. Machine learning (ML) and their subsets, such as deep learning, are also referred to as cognitive computing due to their foundational basis and relationship to cognition.

34384610,Developing a standardized approach for assessing mast cells and eosinophils on tissue biopsies: A Work Group Report of the AAAAI Allergic Skin Diseases Committee.,"Mast cells and eosinophils are commonly found, expectedly or unexpectedly, in human tissue biopsies. Although the clinical significance of their presence, absence, quantity, and quality continues to be investigated in homeostasis and disease, there are currently gaps in knowledge related to what constitutes quantitatively relevant increases in mast cell and eosinophil number in tissue specimens for several clinical conditions. Diagnostically relevant thresholds of mast cell and eosinophil numbers have been proposed and generally accepted by the medical community for a few conditions, such as systemic mastocytosis and eosinophilic esophagitis. However, for other mast cell- and eosinophil-associated disorders, broad discrepancies remain regarding diagnostic thresholds and how samples are processed, routinely and/or specially stained, and interpreted and/or reported by pathologists. These discrepancies can obfuscate or delay a patient's correct diagnosis. Therefore, a work group was assembled to review the literature and develop a standardized consensus for assessing the presence of mast cells and eosinophils for a spectrum of clinical conditions, including systemic mastocytosis and cutaneous mastocytosis, mast cell activation syndrome, eosinophilic esophagitis, eosinophilic gastritis/enteritis, and hypereosinophilia/hypereosinophilic syndrome. The intent of this work group is to build a consensus among pathology, allergy, dermatology, hematology/oncology, and gastroenterology stakeholders for qualitatively and quantitatively assessing mast cells and eosinophils in skin, gastrointestinal, and bone marrow pathologic specimens for the benefit of clinical practice and patients.",Zimmermann N; Abonia JP; Dreskin SC; Akin C; Bolton S; Happel CS; Geller M; Larenas-Linnemann D; Nanda A; Peterson K; Wasan A; Wechsler J; Zhang S; Bernstein JA,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34384610/,0,0,0,0,0,0

The data itself presents challenges that have never been dealt with in molecular epidemiology, and tracking a virus that is changing so rapidly means that we are often running to catch up. Here we review what is known about the evolution of the virus, and the critical impact that whole genomes have had on our ability to trace back and track forward the spread of lineages of SARS-CoV-2. We then review what whole genomes have told us about basic biological properties of the virus such as transmissibility, virulence, and immune escape with a special emphasis on pediatric disease.

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library searched up to 13 May 2021. Randomised controlled trials of three or more weeks investigating the effect of diets with low glycaemic index (GI)/glycaemic load (GL) in diabetes. The primary outcome was glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). Secondary outcomes included other markers of glycaemic control (fasting glucose, fasting insulin); blood lipids (low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), non-HDL-C, apo B, triglycerides); adiposity (body weight, BMI (body mass index), waist circumference), blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)), and inflammation (C reactive protein (CRP)). Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Data were pooled by random effects models. GRADE (grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation) was used to assess the certainty of evidence. 29 trial comparisons were identified in 1617 participants with type 1 and 2 diabetes who were predominantly middle aged, overweight, or obese with moderately controlled type 2 diabetes treated by hyperglycaemia drugs or insulin. Low GI/GL dietary patterns reduced HbA1c in comparison with higher GI/GL control diets (mean difference −0.31% (95% confidence interval −0.42 to −0.19%), P<0.001; substantial heterogeneity, I2=75%, P<0.001). Reductions occurred also in fasting glucose, LDL-C, non-HDL-C, apo B, triglycerides, body weight, BMI, systolic blood pressure (dose-response), and CRP (P<0.05), but not blood insulin, HDL-C, waist circumference, or diastolic blood pressure. A positive dose-response gradient was seen for the difference in GL and HbA1c and for absolute dietary GI and SBP (P<0.05). The certainty of evidence was high for the reduction in HbA1c and moderate for most secondary outcomes, with downgrades due mainly to imprecision. This synthesis suggests that low GI/GL dietary patterns result in small important improvements in established targets of glycaemic control, blood lipids, adiposity, blood pressure, and inflammation beyond concurrent treatment with hyperglycaemia drugs or insulin, predominantly in adults with moderately controlled type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Given the ease of sampling the oral cavity combined with the advances in genomic techniques, there is immense interest in discovering the role of the oral microbiome in esophageal conditions. In this review, we aim to discuss the current evidence highlighting the association between the oral microbiome and esophageal diseases. In particular, we have focused on summarizing the alterations in oral microbiome associated with malignant, premalignant, and benign esophageal cancers, inflammatory and infectious conditions, and esophageal dysmotility diseases. Identifying alterations in the oral microbiome is a key to advancing our understanding of the etiopathogenesis and progression of esophageal diseases, promoting novel diagnostics, and laying the foundation for personalized treatment approaches.

The uptake of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) with 14 or more carbons plays a pivotal role in cellular metabolic homeostasis. Therefore, the uptake and metabolism of LCFAs must constantly be in tune with the cellular, metabolic, and structural requirements of cells. Many metabolic diseases are thought to be driven by the abnormal flow of fatty acids either from the dietary origin and/or released from adipose stores. Cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of fatty acids are facilitated ubiquitously with unique combinations of fatty acid transport proteins and cytoplasmic fatty acid-binding proteins in every tissue. Extensive data are emerging on the defective transporters and metabolism of LCFAs and their clinical implications. Uptake and metabolism of LCFAs are crucial for the brain's functional development and cardiovascular health and maintenance. In addition, data suggest fatty acid metabolic transporter can normalize activated inflammatory response by reprogramming lipid metabolism in cancers. Here we review the current understanding of how LCFAs and their proteins contribute to the pathophysiology of three crucial diseases and the mechanisms involved in the processes.",Mallick R; Basak S; Duttaroy AK,Progress in lipid research,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34293403/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34290831,"Opportunistic diagnosis of osteoporosis, fragile bone strength and vertebral fractures from routine CT scans; a review of approved technology systems and pathways to implementation.","Osteoporosis causes bones to become weak, porous and fracture more easily. While a vertebral fracture is the archetypal fracture of osteoporosis, it is also the most difficult to diagnose clinically. Patients often suffer further spine or other fractures, deformity, height loss and pain before diagnosis. There were an estimated 520,000 fragility fractures in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2017 (costing £4.5 billion), a figure set to increase 30% by 2030. One way to improve both vertebral fracture identification and the diagnosis of osteoporosis is to assess a patient's spine or hips during routine computed tomography (CT) scans. Patients attend routine CT for diagnosis and monitoring of various medical conditions, but the skeleton can be overlooked as radiologists concentrate on the primary reason for scanning. More than half a million CT scans done each year in the National Health Service (NHS) could potentially be screened for osteoporosis (increasing 5% annually). If CT-based screening became embedded in practice, then the technique could have a positive clinical impact in the identification of fragility fracture and/or low bone density. Several companies have developed software methods to diagnose osteoporosis/fragile bone strength and/or identify vertebral fractures in CT datasets, using various methods that include image processing, computational modelling, artificial intelligence and biomechanical engineering concepts. Technology to evaluate Hounsfield units is used to calculate bone density, but not necessarily bone strength. In this rapid evidence review, we summarise the current literature underpinning approved technologies for opportunistic screening of routine CT images to identify fractures, bone density or strength information. We highlight how other new software technologies have become embedded in NHS clinical practice (having overcome barriers to implementation) and highlight how the novel osteoporosis technologies could follow suit. We define the key unanswered questions where further research is needed to enable the adoption of these technologies for maximal patient benefit.",Aggarwal V; Maslen C; Abel RL; Bhattacharya P; Bromiley PA; Clark EM; Compston JE; Crabtree N; Gregory JS; Kariki EP; Harvey NC; Ward KA; Poole KES,Therapeutic advances in musculoskeletal disease,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34290831/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34258685,"Computational strategies for the discovery of biological functions of health foods, nutraceuticals and cosmeceuticals: a review.","Scientific and consumer interest in healthy foods (also known as functional foods), nutraceuticals and cosmeceuticals has increased in the recent years, leading to an increased presence of these products in the market. However, the regulations across different countries that define the type of claims that may be made, and the degree of evidence required to support these claims, are rather inconsistent. Moreover, there is also controversy on the effectiveness and biological mode of action of many of these products, which should undergo an exhaustive approval process to guarantee the consumer rights. Computational approaches constitute invaluable tools to facilitate the discovery of bioactive molecules and provide biological plausibility on the mode of action of these products. Indeed, methodologies like QSAR, docking or molecular dynamics have been used in drug discovery protocols for decades and can now aid in the discovery of bioactive food components. Thanks to these approaches, it is possible to search for new functions in food constituents, which may be part of our daily diet, and help to prevent disorders like diabetes, hypercholesterolemia or obesity. In the present manuscript, computational studies applied to this field are reviewed to illustrate the potential of these approaches to guide the first screening steps and the mechanistic studies of nutraceutical, cosmeceutical and functional foods.",Carpio LE; Sanz Y; Gozalbes R; Barigye SJ,Molecular diversity,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34258685/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34253540,Glucocorticoid induced adrenal insufficiency.,"Synthetic glucocorticoids are widely used for their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive actions. A possible unwanted effect of glucocorticoid treatment is suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which can lead to adrenal insufficiency. Factors affecting the risk of glucocorticoid induced adrenal insufficiency (GI-AI) include the duration of glucocorticoid therapy, mode of administration, glucocorticoid dose and potency, concomitant drugs that interfere with glucocorticoid metabolism, and individual susceptibility. Patients with exogenous glucocorticoid use may develop features of Cushing's syndrome and, subsequently, glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome when the treatment is tapered down. Symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal can overlap with those of the underlying disorder, as well as of GI-AI. A careful approach to the glucocorticoid taper and appropriate patient counseling are needed to assure a successful taper. Glucocorticoid therapy should not be completely stopped until recovery of adrenal function is achieved. In this review, we discuss the factors affecting the risk of GI-AI, propose a regimen for the glucocorticoid taper, and make suggestions for assessment of adrenal function recovery. We also describe current gaps in the management of patients with GI-AI and make suggestions for an approach to the glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome, chronic management of glucocorticoid therapy, and education on GI-AI for patients and providers.",Prete A; Bancos I,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34253540/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Sequencing techniques have been developed alongside this project and have allowed scientists to bypass the limitation of costs for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of single specimens by developing more accurate and extensive cancer sequencing projects, such as deep sequencing of whole genomes and transcriptomic analysis. The Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes recently published WGS data from more than 2600 human cancers together with almost 1200 related transcriptomes. The application of WGS on a large database allowed, for the first time in history, a global analysis of features such as molecular signatures, large structural variations and noncoding regions of the genome, as well as the evaluation of RNA alterations in the absence of underlying DNA mutations. The vast amount of data generated still needs to be thoroughly deciphered, and the advent of machine-learning approaches will be the next step towards the generation of personalized approaches for cancer medicine.

Although the structural and functional roles of DHA in brain development are well investigated, similar roles of ARA are not well documented. The mode of action of these two fatty acids and their derivatives at different structural-functional roles and their levels in the gene expression and signaling pathways of the brain have been continuously emanating. In addition to DHA, the importance of ARA has been much discussed in recent years for fetal and postnatal brain development and the maternal supply of ARA and DHA. These fatty acids are also involved in various brain developmental processes; however, their mechanistic cross talks are not clearly known yet. This review describes the importance of ARA, in addition to DHA, in supporting the optimal brain development and growth and functional roles in the brain.",Basak S; Mallick R; Banerjee A; Pathak S; Duttaroy AK,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34208549/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34206021,Potential Contribution of Short Chain Fatty Acids to Hepatic Apolipoprotein A-I Production.,"Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) is the major protein of high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and has a crucial role in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). It has been postulated that elevating production of de novo ApoA-I might translate into the formation of new functional HDL particles that could lower cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk via RCT. During inflammation, serum ApoA-I concentrations are reduced, which contributes to the development of dysfunctional HDL particles as Serum Amyloid A (SAA) overtakes the position of ApoA-I within the HDL particles. Therefore, instead of elevating serum HDL cholesterol concentrations, rescuing lower serum ApoA-I concentrations could be beneficial in both normal and inflamed conditions. Several nutritional compounds, amongst others short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), have shown their capacity to modulate hepatic lipoprotein metabolism. In this review we provide an overview of HDL and more specific ApoA-I metabolism, SCFAs physiology and the current knowledge regarding the influence of SCFAs on ApoA-I expression and synthesis in human liver cells. We conclude that the current evidence regarding the effect of SCFAs on ApoA-I transcription and secretion is promising, however there is a need to investigate which dietary fibres could lead to increased SCFAs formation and consequent elevated ApoA-I concentrations.",Popeijus HE; Zwaan W; Tayyeb JZ; Plat J,International journal of molecular sciences,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34206021/,1,0,0,0,0,0

While there have been clear successes in large-scale human genetic studies in recent decades, there is still a substantial amount of missing heritability to be elucidated for complex childhood disorders. Mounting evidence, primarily in animals, suggests environmental exposures may generate or perpetuate altered health outcomes across one or more generations. One putative mechanism for these environmental health effects is via altered epigenetic regulation. This review highlights the current epidemiologic literature and supporting animal studies that describe intergenerational and transgenerational health effects of environmental exposures.

34093645,Self-Organization and Information Processing: From Basic Enzymatic Activities to Complex Adaptive Cellular Behavior.,"One of the main aims of current biology is to understand the origin of the molecular organization that underlies the complex dynamic architecture of cellular life. Here, we present an overview of the main sources of biomolecular order and complexity spanning from the most elementary levels of molecular activity to the emergence of cellular systemic behaviors. First, we have addressed the dissipative self-organization, the principal source of molecular order in the cell. Intensive studies over the last four decades have demonstrated that self-organization is central to understand enzyme activity under cellular conditions, functional coordination between enzymatic reactions, the emergence of dissipative metabolic networks (DMN), and molecular rhythms. The second fundamental source of order is molecular information processing. Studies on effective connectivity based on transfer entropy (TE) have made possible the quantification in bits of biomolecular information flows in DMN. This information processing enables efficient self-regulatory control of metabolism. As a consequence of both main sources of order, systemic functional structures emerge in the cell; in fact, quantitative analyses with DMN have revealed that the basic units of life display a global enzymatic structure that seems to be an essential characteristic of the systemic functional metabolism. This global metabolic structure has been verified experimentally in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Here, we also discuss how the study of systemic DMN, using Artificial Intelligence and advanced tools of Statistic Mechanics, has shown the emergence of Hopfield-like dynamics characterized by exhibiting associative memory. We have recently confirmed this thesis by testing associative conditioning behavior in individual amoeba cells. In these Pavlovian-like experiments, several hundreds of cells could learn new systemic migratory behaviors and remember them over long periods relative to their cell cycle, forgetting them later. Such associative process seems to correspond to an epigenetic memory. The cellular capacity of learning new adaptive systemic behaviors represents a fundamental evolutionary mechanism for cell adaptation.",De la Fuente IM; Martínez L; Carrasco-Pujante J; Fedetz M; López JI; Malaina I,Frontiers in genetics,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34093645/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Although the precise etiology of IBD is largely unknown, it is widely thought that diet contributes to the development of IBD. Diet shapes the composition of the gut microbiota, which plays critical roles in intestinal homeostasis. In contrast, intestinal inflammation induces gut dysbiosis and may affect the use of dietary nutrients by host cells and the gut microbiota. The interaction of diet and the gut microbiota is perturbed in patients with IBD. Herein, we review the current knowledge of diet and gut microbiota interaction in intestinal homeostasis. We also discuss alterations of diet and gut microbiota interaction that influence the outcome and the nutritional treatment of IBD.

34017312,Diabetes and Prediabetes in Children With Cystic Fibrosis: A Systematic Review of the Literature and Recommendations of the Italian Society for Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes (ISPED).,"Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is a comorbidity of cystic fibrosis (CF) that negatively impacts on its clinical course. Prediabetes is an important predictor of either CFRD development and unfavorable prognosis of CF in both pediatric and adult patients. International guidelines recommend insulin only in case of CFRD diagnosis. Whether early detection and treatment of prediabetes may contribute to improve the clinical course of CF is still debated. A subgroup of pediatric diabetologists of the Italian Society for Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetology (ISPED) performed a systematic review of the literature based on predefined outcomes: impact of pre-diabetes on clinical outcomes and on the risk of developing CFRD; diagnosis of diabetes and pre-diabetes under 10 years of age; effectiveness of therapy on glycemic control, impact of therapy on pulmonary function and nutritional status. Thirty-one papers were selected for the analysis data presented in these papers were reported in tables sorted by outcomes, including comprehensive evidence grading according to the GRADE approach. Following the grading of the quality of the evidence, the entire ISPED diabetes study group achieved consensus for the Italian recommendations based on both evidence and clinical experience. We concluded that in patients with CF, prediabetes should be carefully considered as it can evolve into CFRD. In patients with CF and prediabetic conditions, after complete evaluation of the OGTT trend, glucometrics, glycemic values measured during pulmonary exacerbations and/or steroid therapy, early initiation of insulin therapy could have beneficial effects on clinical outcomes of patients with CF and prediabetes.",Mozzillo E; Franceschi R; Piona C; Passanisi S; Casertano A; Pjetraj D; Maltoni G; Calcaterra V; Cauvin V; Cherubini V; D'Annunzio G; Franzese A; Frongia AP; Lombardo F; Lo Presti D; Matteoli MC; Piccinno E; Predieri B; Rabbone I; Scaramuzza AE; Toni S; Zucchini S; Maffeis C; Schiaffini R,Frontiers in endocrinology,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34017312/,0,1,0,0,0,0

The effectiveness of clinical nutrition services in the treatment of diseases in inpatients has been demonstrated in several studies. However, in recent days, innovative changes are pursued in clinical nutrition services through a convergence with information and communication technology (ICT), a core technology of the fourth industrial revolution such as big data, deep learning, and artificial intelligence (AI). The health care environment is changing from a medical treatment-oriented service to a preventive and personalized paradigm. Furthermore, we live in an era of personalization where we can personalize dietary aspects including food choice, cooking recipes, and nutrition in daily life. In addition, ICT technology can build a personalized nutrition platform in consideration of individual patient's diseases, genetic trait, and environment, all of which can be technical means in personalized nutrition management services. Personalized nutrition based on ICT technology is able to provide more standardized and high-quality clinical nutrition services to the patients.

33977380,Sodium and Health Outcomes: Ascertaining Valid Estimates in Research Studies.,"The dietary reference intake (DRI) for sodium has been highly debated with persuasive and elegant arguments made for both population sodium reduction and for maintenance of the status quo. After the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) report was published, controversy ensued, and by Congressional mandate, the sodium DRIs were updated in 2019. The 2019 DRIs defined adequate intake (AI) levels by age-sex groups that are largely consistent with the DRIs for sodium that were published in 2005. Given the overall similarities between the 2005 and 2019 DRIs, one may wonder how the recently published research on sodium and health outcomes was considered in determining the DRIs, particularly, the recent studies from very large observational cohort studies. We aim to address this concern and outline the major threats to ascertaining valid estimates of the relationship between dietary sodium and health outcomes in observational cohort studies. We use tools from modern epidemiology to demonstrate how unexpected and inconsistent findings in these relationships may emerge. We use directed acyclic graphs to illustrate specific examples in which biases may occur. We identified the following key threats to internal validity: poorly defined target intervention, poorly measured sodium exposure, unmeasured or residual confounding, reverse causality, and selection bias. Researchers should consider these threats to internal validity while developing research questions and throughout the research process. For the DRIs to inform real-world interventions relating to sodium reduction, it is recommended that more specific research questions be asked that can clearly define potential interventions of interest.",Anderson CAM; Delker E; Ix JH,Current atherosclerosis reports,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33977380/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The concept of PM assumes several interpretations in the literature, with particular regards to Genetic and Genomic Medicine. Despite the fact that some disease-modifying genes affect disease expression and progression, many complex conditions cannot be understood through only this lens, especially when other lifestyle factors can play a crucial role (such as the environment, emotions, nutrition, etc.). Personalizing clinical phenotyping becomes a challenge when different pathophysiological mechanisms underlie the same manifestation. Brain disorders, cardiovascular and gastroenterological diseases can be paradigmatic examples. Experiences on the field of Fondazione Policlinico Gemelli in Rome (a research hospital recognized by the Italian Ministry of Health as national leader in ""Personalized Medicine"" and ""Innovative Biomedical Technologies"") could help understanding which techniques and tools are the most performing to develop potential clinical phenotypes personalization.

The symposium aimed to advance scientific rigor in translational studies from animal to human models with the goal of identifying underlying mechanisms and treatments. In this review, we discuss fundamental gaps in knowledge of the heterogeneity of obesity ranging from cellular to population perspectives. We also advocate approaches to overcoming limitations in the field. Examples include the use of contemporary mouse genetic reference population models such as the Collaborative Cross and Diversity Outbred mice that effectively model human genetic diversity and the use of translational models that integrate -omics and computational approaches from pre-clinical to clinical models of obesity. Finally, we suggest best scientific practices to ensure strong rigor that will allow investigators to delineate the sources of heterogeneity in the population with obesity.

To date, studies in animal models of T1D, as well as studies in human subjects, have linked several intestinal microbiota alterations with T1D pathogenesis. Features that are most often linked with T1D pathogenesis include decreased microbial diversity, the relative abundance of specific strains of individual microbes, and altered metabolite production. Alterations in these features as well as others have provided insight into T1D pathogenesis and shed light on the potential mechanism by which the microbiota plays a role in T1D pathogenesis, yet the underlying factors leading to these alterations remains unknown. One potential mechanism for alteration of the microbiota is through diet and nutrition. Previous studies have shown associations of diet with islet autoimmunity, but a direct contributing factor has yet to be identified. Diet, through introduction of antigens and alteration of the composition and function of the microbiota, may elicit the immune system to produce autoreactive responses that result in the destruction of the beta cells. Here, we review the evidence associating diet induced changes in the intestinal microbiota and their contribution to T1D pathogenesis. We further provide a roadmap for determining the effect of diet and other modifiable factors on the entire microbiota ecosystem, including its impact on both immune and beta cell function, as it relates to T1D. A greater understanding of the complex interactions between the intestinal microbiota and several interacting systems in the body (immune, intestinal integrity and function, metabolism, beta cell function, etc.) may provide scientifically rational approaches to prevent development of T1D and other childhood immune and allergic diseases and biomarkers to evaluate the efficacy of interventions.",Hamilton-Williams EE; Lorca GL; Norris JM; Dunne JL,Frontiers in nutrition,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33869260/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33866251,Precision nutrition: A systematic literature review.,"Precision Nutrition research aims to use personal information about individuals or groups of individuals to deliver nutritional advice that, theoretically, would be more suitable than generic advice. Machine learning, a subbranch of Artificial Intelligence, has promise to aid in the development of predictive models that are suitable for Precision Nutrition. As such, recent research has applied machine learning algorithms, tools, and techniques in precision nutrition for different purposes. However, a systematic overview of the state-of-the-art on the use of machine learning in Precision Nutrition is lacking. Therefore, we carried out a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to provide an overview of where and how machine learning has been used in Precision Nutrition from various aspects, what such machine learning models use as input features, what the availability status of the data used in the literature is, and how the models are evaluated. Nine research questions were defined in this study. We retrieved 4930 papers from electronic databases and 60 primary studies were selected to respond to the research questions. All of the selected primary studies were also briefly discussed in this article. Our results show that fifteen problems spread across seven domains of nutrition and health are present. Four machine learning tasks are seen in the form of regression, classification, recommendation and clustering, with most of these utilizing a supervised approach. In total, 30 algorithms were used, with 19 appearing more than once. Models were through the use of four groups of approaches and 23 evaluation metrics. Personalized approaches are promising to reduce the burden of these current problems in nutrition research, and the current review shows Machine Learning can be incorporated into Precision Nutrition research with high performance. Precision Nutrition researchers should consider incorporating Machine Learning into their methods to facilitate the integration of many complex features, allowing for the development of high-performance Precision Nutrition approaches.",Kirk D; Catal C; Tekinerdogan B,Computers in biology and medicine,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33866251/,0,1,0,0,0,0
33860816,Influence of glycemic control and hypoglycemia on the risk of fracture in patients with diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.,"Individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM) have an increased risk of fracture. Glycemic control is crucial to the management of DM, but there are concerns pertaining to hypoglycemia development in the course of glycemic control target achievement. The extent to which glycemic control may affect the risk of fracture remains less defined. Hypoglycemia-induced falls have been suggested to contribute to an elevated risk of fracture in DM patients. In this meta-analysis of observational studies, we aimed to investigate the relative contribution of glycemic control, as measured by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and hypoglycemia to the risk of fracture in DM. The PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for relevant studies. A random-effects model was used to generate summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Both increased HbA1c levels (RR <sub>per 1% increase</sub> 1.08, 95% CI 1.03, 1.14; n<sub>studies</sub> = 10) and hypoglycemia (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.23, 1.88; n<sub>studies</sub> = 8) were associated with an increased risk of fracture. The association between HbA1c levels and the risk of fracture was somewhat nonlinear, with a noticeably increased risk observed at an HbA1c level ≥ 8%. The positive associations of HbA1c levels and hypoglycemia with the risk of fracture did not reach statistical significance in the studies that adjusted for insulin use, hypoglycemia, or falls for the former and in those that adjusted for falls for the latter. In summary, both increased HbA1c levels and hypoglycemia may increase the risk of fracture in patients with DM. The positive association between HbA1c levels and the risk of fracture appears to be, in part, explained by hypoglycemia-induced falls, possibly due to insulin use. The avoidance of hypoglycemia in the course of achieving good glycemic control through the careful selection of glucose-lowering medications may contribute to fracture prevention by reducing the risk of falls related to treatment-induced hypoglycemia.",Hidayat K; Fang QL; Shi BM; Qin LQ,Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33860816/,0,1,0,1,0,0
33835956,Artificial Intelligence and Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer: 2020 Summative Review.,"Despite considerable research efforts, pancreatic cancer is associated with a dire prognosis and a 5-year survival rate of only 10%. Early symptoms of the disease are mostly nonspecific. The premise of improved survival through early detection is that more individuals will benefit from potentially curative treatment. Artificial intelligence (AI) methodology has emerged as a successful tool for risk stratification and identification in general health care. In response to the maturity of AI, Kenner Family Research Fund conducted the 2020 AI and Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer Virtual Summit (www.pdac-virtualsummit.org) in conjunction with the American Pancreatic Association, with a focus on the potential of AI to advance early detection efforts in this disease. This comprehensive presummit article was prepared based on information provided by each of the interdisciplinary participants on one of the 5 following topics: Progress, Problems, and Prospects for Early Detection; AI and Machine Learning; AI and Pancreatic Cancer-Current Efforts; Collaborative Opportunities; and Moving Forward-Reflections from Government, Industry, and Advocacy. The outcome from the robust Summit conversations, to be presented in a future white paper, indicate that significant progress must be the result of strategic collaboration among investigators and institutions from multidisciplinary backgrounds, supported by committed funders.",Kenner B; Chari ST; Kelsen D; Klimstra DS; Pandol SJ; Rosenthal M; Rustgi AK; Taylor JA; Yala A; Abul-Husn N; Andersen DK; Bernstein D; Brunak S; Canto MI; Eldar YC; Fishman EK; Fleshman J; Go VLW; Holt JM; Field B; Goldberg A; Hoos W; Iacobuzio-Donahue C; Li D; Lidgard G; Maitra A; Matrisian LM; Poblete S; Rothschild L; Sander C; Schwartz LH; Shalit U; Srivastava S; Wolpin B,Pancreas,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33835956/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Despite extensive research efforts toward improving diagnosis and treatment, the 5-year survival rate at best is approximately 15%. This dismal figure can be attributed to a variety of factors including lack of adequate screening methods, late symptom onset, and treatment resistance. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma remains a grim diagnosis with a high mortality rate and a significant psy-chological burden for patients and their families. In recent years artificial intelligence (AI) has permeated the medical field at an accelerated pace, bringing potential new tools that carry the promise of improving diagnosis and treatment of a variety of diseases.

33828315,The NIH Somatic Cell Genome Editing program.,"The move from reading to writing the human genome offers new opportunities to improve human health. The United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) Somatic Cell Genome Editing (SCGE) Consortium aims to accelerate the development of safer and more-effective methods to edit the genomes of disease-relevant somatic cells in patients, even in tissues that are difficult to reach. Here we discuss the consortium's plans to develop and benchmark approaches to induce and measure genome modifications, and to define downstream functional consequences of genome editing within human cells. Central to this effort is a rigorous and innovative approach that requires validation of the technology through third-party testing in small and large animals. New genome editors, delivery technologies and methods for tracking edited cells in vivo, as well as newly developed animal models and human biological systems, will be assembled-along with validated datasets-into an SCGE Toolkit, which will be disseminated widely to the biomedical research community. We visualize this toolkit-and the knowledge generated by its applications-as a means to accelerate the clinical development of new therapies for a wide range of conditions.",Saha K; Sontheimer EJ; Brooks PJ; Dwinell MR; Gersbach CA; Liu DR; Murray SA; Tsai SQ; Wilson RC; Anderson DG; Asokan A; Banfield JF; Bankiewicz KS; Bao G; Bulte JWM; Bursac N; Campbell JM; Carlson DF; Chaikof EL; Chen ZY; Cheng RH; Clark KJ; Curiel DT; Dahlman JE; Deverman BE; Dickinson ME; Doudna JA; Ekker SC; Emborg ME; Feng G; Freedman BS; Gamm DM; Gao G; Ghiran IC; Glazer PM; Gong S; Heaney JD; Hennebold JD; Hinson JT; Khvorova A; Kiani S; Lagor WR; Lam KS; Leong KW; Levine JE; Lewis JA; Lutz CM; Ly DH; Maragh S; McCray PB; McDevitt TC; Mirochnitchenko O; Morizane R; Murthy N; Prather RS; Ronald JA; Roy S; Roy S; Sabbisetti V; Saltzman WM; Santangelo PJ; Segal DJ; Shimoyama M; Skala MC; Tarantal AF; Tilton JC; Truskey GA; Vandsburger M; Watts JK; Wells KD; Wolfe SA; Xu Q; Xue W; Yi G; Zhou J,Nature,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33828315/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33804088,Tryptophan Metabolism and Gut-Brain Homeostasis.,"Tryptophan is an essential amino acid critical for protein synthesis in humans that has emerged as a key player in the microbiota-gut-brain axis. It is the only precursor for the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is vital for the processing of emotional regulation, hunger, sleep, and pain, as well as colonic motility and secretory activity in the gut. Tryptophan catabolites from the kynurenine degradation pathway also modulate neural activity and are active in the systemic inflammatory cascade. Additionally, tryptophan and its metabolites support the development of the central and enteric nervous systems. Accordingly, dysregulation of tryptophan metabolites plays a central role in the pathogenesis of many neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Gut microbes influence tryptophan metabolism directly and indirectly, with corresponding changes in behavior and cognition. The gut microbiome has thus garnered much attention as a therapeutic target for both neurologic and psychiatric disorders where tryptophan and its metabolites play a prominent role. In this review, we will touch upon some of these features and their involvement in health and disease.",Roth W; Zadeh K; Vekariya R; Ge Y; Mohamadzadeh M,International journal of molecular sciences,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33804088/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33803198,Omics Approaches in Adipose Tissue and Skeletal Muscle Addressing the Role of Extracellular Matrix in Obesity and Metabolic Dysfunction.,"Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling plays important roles in both white adipose tissue (WAT) and the skeletal muscle (SM) metabolism. Excessive adipocyte hypertrophy causes fibrosis, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction in adipose tissue, as well as impaired adipogenesis. Similarly, disturbed ECM remodeling in SM has metabolic consequences such as decreased insulin sensitivity. Most of described ECM molecular alterations have been associated with DNA sequence variation, alterations in gene expression patterns, and epigenetic modifications. Among others, the most important epigenetic mechanism by which cells are able to modulate their gene expression is DNA methylation. Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS) have become a powerful approach to identify DNA methylation variation associated with biological traits in humans. Likewise, Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and gene expression microarrays have allowed the study of whole-genome genetics and transcriptomics patterns in obesity and metabolic diseases. The aim of this review is to explore the molecular basis of ECM in WAT and SM remodeling in obesity and the consequences of metabolic complications. For that purpose, we reviewed scientific literature including all omics approaches reporting genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic (GWAS, EWAS, and RNA-seq or cDNA arrays) ECM-related alterations in WAT and SM as associated with metabolic dysfunction and obesity.",Anguita-Ruiz A; Bustos-Aibar M; Plaza-Díaz J; Mendez-Gutierrez A; Alcalá-Fdez J; Aguilera CM; Ruiz-Ojeda FJ,International journal of molecular sciences,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33803198/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33798408,Discovering the landscape of protein modifications.,"Protein modifications modulate nearly every aspect of cell biology in organisms, ranging from Archaea to Eukaryotes. The earliest evidence of covalent protein modifications was found in the early 20th century by studying the amino acid composition of proteins by chemical hydrolysis. These discoveries challenged what defined a canonical amino acid. The advent and rapid adoption of mass-spectrometry-based proteomics in the latter part of the 20th century enabled a veritable explosion in the number of known protein modifications, with more than 500 discrete modifications counted today. Now, new computational tools in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence are poised to allow researchers to make significant progress in discovering new protein modifications and determining their function. In this review, we take an opportunity to revisit the historical discovery of key post-translational modifications, quantify the current landscape of covalent protein adducts, and assess the role that new computational tools will play in the future of this field.",Keenan EK; Zachman DK; Hirschey MD,Molecular cell,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33798408/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33781555,Non-coding RNAs related to angiogenesis in gynecological cancer.,"Gynecological cancer affects the female reproductive system, including ovarian, uterine, endometrial, cervical, vulvar, and vaginal tumors. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), and in particular microRNAs, function as regulatory molecules, which can control gene expression in a post-transcriptional manner. Normal physiological processes like cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, and pathological processes such as oncogenesis and metastasis are regulated by microRNAs. Numerous reports have shown a direct role of microRNAs in the modulation of angiogenesis in gynecological cancer, via targeting pro-angiogenic factors and signaling pathways. Understanding the molecular mechanism involved in the regulation of angiogenesis by microRNAs may lead to new treatment options. Recently the regulatory role of some long non-coding RNAs in gynecological cancer has also been explored, but the information on this function is more limited. The aim of this article is to explore the pathways responsible for angiogenesis, and to what extent ncRNAs may be employed as biomarkers or therapeutic targets in gynecological cancer.",Rahimian N; Razavi ZS; Aslanbeigi F; Mirkhabbaz AM; Piroozmand H; Shahrzad MK; Hamblin MR; Mirzaei H,Gynecologic oncology,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33781555/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33770535,Food for thought: addressing undernutrition to end tuberculosis.,"Tuberculosis is the leading cause of deaths from an infectious disease worldwide. WHO's End TB Strategy is falling short of several 2020 targets. Undernutrition is the leading population-level risk factor for tuberculosis. Studies have consistently found that undernutrition is associated with increased tuberculosis incidence, increased severity, worse treatment outcomes, and increased mortality. Modelling studies support implementing nutritional interventions for people living with tuberculosis and those at risk of tuberculosis disease to ensure the success of the End TB Strategy. In this Personal View, we highlight nutrition-related immunocompromisation, implications of undernutrition for tuberculosis treatment and prevention, the role of nutritional supplementation, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antimycobacterial medications in undernourished people with tuberculosis, and the role of social protection interventions in addressing undernutrition as a tuberculosis risk factor. To catalyse action on this insufficiently addressed accelerant of the global tuberculosis epidemic, research should be prioritised to understand the immunological pathways that are impaired by nutrient deficiencies, develop tools to diagnose clinical and subclinical tuberculosis in people who are undernourished, and understand how nutritional status affects the efficacy of tuberculosis vaccine and therapy. Through primary research, modelling, and implementation research, policy change should also be accelerated, particularly in countries with a high burden of tuberculosis.",Sinha P; Lönnroth K; Bhargava A; Heysell SK; Sarkar S; Salgame P; Rudgard W; Boccia D; Van Aartsen D; Hochberg NS,The Lancet.

33766750,Long non-coding RNAs in the doxorubicin resistance of cancer cells.,"Chemotherapy is the main treatment used for cancer patients failing surgery. Doxorubicin (DOX) is a well-known chemotherapeutic agent capable of suppressing proliferation in cancer cells and triggering apoptosis via inhibiting topoisomerase II activity and producing DNA breaks. This activity of DOX restrains mitosis and cell cycle progression. However, frequent application of DOX results in the emergence of resistance in the cancer cells. It seems that genetic and epigenetic factors can provide DOX resistance of cancer cells. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a subcategory of non-coding RNAs with role in the regulation of several cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, differentiation and apoptosis. LncRNA dysregulation has been associated with chemoresistance, and this profile occurs upon DOX treatment of cancer. In the present review, we focus on the role of lncRNAs in mediating DOX resistance and discuss the molecular pathways and mechanisms. LncRNAs can drive DOX resistance via activating pathways such as NF-κB, PI3K/Akt, Wnt, and FOXC2. Some lncRNAs can activate protective autophagy in response to the stress caused by DOX, which mediates resistance. In contrast, there are other lncRNAs involved in the sensitivity of cancer cells to DOX, such as GAS5, PTCSC3 and FENDRR. Some anti-tumor agents such as polydatin can regulate the expression of lncRNAs, enhancing DOX sensitivity. Overall, lncRNAs are potential players in DOX resistance, and their identification and targeting are of importance in chemosensitivity. Furthermore, these findings can be translated into clinical for treatment of cancer patients.",Ashrafizaveh S; Ashrafizadeh M; Zarrabi A; Husmandi K; Zabolian A; Shahinozzaman M; Aref AR; Hamblin MR; Nabavi N; Crea F; Wang Y; Ahn KS,Cancer letters,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33766750/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33753868,Streptococcal bacterial components in cancer therapy.,"The incidence rate of cancer is steadily increasing all around the world, and there is an urgent need to develop novel and more effective treatment strategies. Recently, bacterial therapy has been investigated as a new approach to target cancer, and is becoming a serious option. Streptococcus strains are among the most common and well-studied virulent bacteria that cause a variety of human infections. Everyone has experienced a sore throat during their lifetime, or has been asymptomatically colonized by streptococci. The ability of Streptococcus bacteria to fight cancer was discovered more than 100 years ago, and over the years has undergone clinical trials, but the mechanism is not yet completely understood. Recently, several animal models and human clinical trials have been reported. Streptococcal strains can have an intrinsic anti-tumor activity, or can activate the host immune system to fight the tumor. Bacteria can selectively accumulate and proliferate in the hypoxic regions of solid tumors. Moreover, the bacteria can be genetically engineered to secrete toxins or enzymes that can specifically attack the tumors.",Marzhoseyni Z; Shojaie L; Tabatabaei SA; Movahedpour A; Safari M; Esmaeili D; Mahjoubin-Tehran M; Jalili A; Morshedi K; Khan H; Okhravi R; Hamblin MR; Mirzaei H,Cancer gene therapy,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33753868/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33739235,Potential value and impact of data mining and machine learning in clinical diagnostics.,"Data mining involves the use of mathematical sciences, statistics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to determine the relationships between variables from a large sample of data. It has previously been shown that data mining can improve the prediction and diagnostic precision of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A few studies have applied machine learning to assess hypertension and metabolic syndrome-related biomarkers, as well as refine the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Machine learning methods have also been applied to assess new biomarkers and survival outcomes in patients with renal diseases to predict the development of chronic kidney disease, disease progression, and renal graft survival. In the latter, random forest methods were found to be the best for the prediction of chronic kidney disease. Some studies have investigated the prognosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and acute liver failure, as well as therapy response prediction in patients with viral disorders, using decision tree models. Machine learning techniques, such as Sparse High-Order Interaction Model with Rejection Option, have been used for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. Data mining techniques have also been applied to identify the risk factors for serious mental illness, such as depression and dementia, and help to diagnose and predict the quality of life of such patients. In relation to child health, some studies have determined the best algorithms for predicting obesity and malnutrition. Machine learning has determined the important risk factors for preterm birth and low birth weight. Published studies of patients with cancer and bacterial diseases are limited and should perhaps be addressed more comprehensively in future studies. Herein, we provide an in-depth review of studies in which biochemical biomarker data were analyzed using machine learning methods to assess the risk of several common diseases, in order to summarize the potential applications of data mining methods in clinical diagnosis. Data mining techniques have now been increasingly applied to clinical diagnostics, and they have the potential to support this field.",Saberi-Karimian M; Khorasanchi Z; Ghazizadeh H; Tayefi M; Saffar S; Ferns GA; Ghayour-Mobarhan M,Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33739235/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33718439,Guidelines for Robotic Flexible Endoscopy at the Time of COVID-19.,"Flexible endoscopy involves the insertion of a long narrow flexible tube into the body for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. In the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, flexible endoscopy plays a major role in cancer screening, surveillance, and treatment programs. As a result of gas insufflation during the procedure, both upper and lower GI endoscopy procedures have been classified as aerosol generating by the guidelines issued by the respective societies during the COVID-19 pandemic-although no quantifiable data on aerosol generation currently exists. Due to the risk of COVID-19 transmission to healthcare workers, most societies halted non-emergency and diagnostic procedures during the lockdown. The long-term implications of stoppage in cancer diagnoses and treatment is predicted to lead to a large increase in preventable deaths. Robotics may play a major role in this field by allowing healthcare operators to control the flexible endoscope from a safe distance and pave a path for protecting healthcare workers through minimizing the risk of virus transmission without reducing diagnostic and therapeutic capacities. This review focuses on the needs and challenges associated with the design of robotic flexible endoscopes for use during a pandemic. The authors propose that a few minor changes to existing platforms or considerations for platforms in development could lead to significant benefits for use during infection control scenarios.",Onaizah O; Koszowska Z; Winters C; Subramanian V; Jayne D; Arezzo A; Obstein KL; Valdastri P,Frontiers in robotics and AI,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33718439/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33707469,Adrenal insufficiency.,"Adrenal insufficiency (AI) is a condition characterized by an absolute or relative deficiency of adrenal cortisol production. Primary AI (PAI) is rare and is caused by direct adrenal failure. Secondary AI (SAI) is more frequent and is caused by diseases affecting the pituitary, whereas in tertiary AI (TAI), the hypothalamus is affected. The most prevalent form is TAI owing to exogenous glucocorticoid use. Symptoms of AI are non-specific, often overlooked or misdiagnosed, and are related to the lack of cortisol, adrenal androgen precursors and aldosterone (especially in PAI). Diagnosis is based on measurement of the adrenal corticosteroid hormones, their regulatory peptide hormones and stimulation tests. The goal of therapy is to establish a hormone replacement regimen that closely mimics the physiological diurnal cortisol secretion pattern, tailored to the patient's daily needs. This Primer provides insights into the epidemiology, mechanisms and management of AI during pregnancy as well as challenges of long-term management. In addition, the importance of identifying life-threatening adrenal emergencies (acute AI and adrenal crisis) is highlighted and strategies for prevention, which include patient education, glucocorticoid emergency cards and injection kits, are described.",Hahner S; Ross RJ; Arlt W; Bancos I; Burger-Stritt S; Torpy DJ; Husebye ES; Quinkler M,Nature reviews.

While cryptosporidiosis has likely affected humanity for millennia, its recent ""emergence"" is largely the result of discoveries made through major epidemiologic studies in the past decade. There is no vaccine, and the only approved medicine, nitazoxanide, has been shown to have efficacy limitations in several patient groups known to be at elevated risk of disease. In order to help frontline health workers, policymakers, and other stakeholders translate our current understanding of cryptosporidiosis into actionable guidance to address the disease, we sought to assess salient issues relating to clinical management of cryptosporidiosis drawing from a review of the literature and our own field-based practice. This exercise is meant to help inform health system strategies for improving access to current treatments, to highlight recent achievements and outstanding knowledge and clinical practice gaps, and to help guide research activities for new anti-Cryptosporidium therapies.",Ashigbie PG; Shepherd S; Steiner KL; Amadi B; Aziz N; Manjunatha UH; Spector JM; Diagana TT; Kelly P,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33705395/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33684433,Evolution of organoid technology: Lessons learnt in Co-Culture systems from developmental biology.,"In recent years, the development of 3D organoids has opened new avenues of investigation into development, physiology, and regenerative medicine. Organoid formation and the process of organogenesis share common developmental pathways; thus, our knowledge of developmental biology can help model the complexity of different organs to refine organoids into a more sophisticated platform. The developmental process is strongly dependent on complex networks and communication of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions among different cell populations and their microenvironment, during embryogenesis. These interactions affect cell behaviors such as proliferation, survival, migration, and differentiation. Co-culture systems within the organoid technology were recently developed and provided the highly physiologically relevant systems. Supportive cells including various types of endothelial and stromal cells provide the proper microenvironment, facilitate organoid assembly, and improve vascularization and maturation of organoids. This review discusses the role of the co-culture systems in organoid generation, with a focus on how knowledge of developmental biology has directed and continues to shape the development of more evolved 3D co-culture system-derived organoids.",Zahmatkesh E; Khoshdel-Rad N; Mirzaei H; Shpichka A; Timashev P; Mahmoudi T; Vosough M,Developmental biology,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33684433/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33681110,Predicting Therapeutic Response in Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis-A Journey Towards Precision Medicine.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a disabling disease, characterized by chronic inflammation of the colon, with a rising prevalence worldwide in the pediatric age group. Although UC presents in children with varying severity, disease extent, and comorbidities, initial treatment is essentially uniform, consisting of 5-aminosalicylate drugs with corticosteroid induction for those with moderately to severely active disease. With the advent of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biologic therapy and several new biologics and small-molecule drugs for UC, precision medicine approaches to treatment are needed to more rapidly achieve sustained remission, restore quality of life, normalize development, and limit exposure to toxic corticosteroids in children with UC. Here, we review available data on clinical, biochemical, histopathologic, and molecular predictors of treatment response in UC. We also address known predictors and special treatment considerations in specific relevant scenarios such as very-early-onset UC, acute severe UC, ileal pouch anal anastomosis, and UC with concomitant primary sclerosing cholangitis. The review concludes with a prediction of how machine learning will integrate multimodal patient data to bring precision medicine to the bedside of children with UC in the future.",Colman RJ; Dhaliwal J; Rosen MJ,Frontiers in pediatrics,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33681110/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The application of artificial intelligence in gastroenterology ranges from colon cancer screening and characterization of dysplastic and neoplastic polyps to the endoscopic ultrasonographic evaluation of pancreatic diseases. Artificial intelligence has been found to be useful in the evaluation and enhancement of the quality measure for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Similarly, artificial intelligence techniques like artificial neural networks and faster region-based convolution network are showing promising results in early and accurate diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and its differentiation from chronic pancreatitis. Other artificial intelligence techniques like radiomics-based computer-aided diagnosis systems could help to differentiate between various types of cystic pancreatic lesions. Artificial intelligence and computer-aided systems also showing promising results in the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma and the prediction of choledocholithiasis.

33643310,Role of Human Milk Bioactives on Infants' Gut and Immune Health.,"Exclusive human milk feeding of the newborn is recommended during the first 6 months of life to promote optimal health outcomes during early life and beyond. Human milk contains a variety of bioactive factors such as hormones, cytokines, leukocytes, immunoglobulins, lactoferrin, lysozyme, stem cells, human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), microbiota, and microRNAs. Recent findings highlighted the potential importance of adding HMOs into infant formula for their roles in enhancing host defense mechanisms in neonates. Therefore, understanding the roles of human milk bioactive factors on immune function is critical to build the scientific evidence base around breastfeeding recommendations, and to enhance positive health outcomes in formula fed infants through modifications to formulas. However, there are still knowledge gaps concerning the roles of different milk components, the interactions between the different components, and the mechanisms behind health outcomes are poorly understood. This review aims to show the current knowledge about HMOs, milk microbiota, immunoglobulins, lactoferrin, and milk microRNAs (miRNAs) and how these could have similar mechanisms of regulating gut and microbiota function.

Since then, this topic has received increasing attention, and many scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Thus, it is important to formulate on a regular basis updated guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Despite numerous reviews, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to evaluate autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we present a set of guidelines for investigators to select and interpret methods to examine autophagy and related processes, and for reviewers to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of reports that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a dogmatic set of rules, because the appropriateness of any assay largely depends on the question being asked and the system being used. Moreover, no individual assay is perfect for every situation, calling for the use of multiple techniques to properly monitor autophagy in each experimental setting. Finally, several core components of the autophagy machinery have been implicated in distinct autophagic processes (canonical and noncanonical autophagy), implying that genetic approaches to block autophagy should rely on targeting two or more autophagy-related genes that ideally participate in distinct steps of the pathway. Along similar lines, because multiple proteins involved in autophagy also regulate other cellular pathways including apoptosis, not all of them can be used as a specific marker for <i>bona fide</i> autophagic responses. Here, we critically discuss current methods of assessing autophagy and the information they can, or cannot, provide. Our ultimate goal is to encourage intellectual and technical innovation in the field.",Klionsky DJ; Abdel-Aziz AK; Abdelfatah S; Abdellatif M; Abdoli A; Abel S; Abeliovich H; Abildgaard MH; Abudu YP;

33613518,Virus Infections and Host Metabolism-Can We Manage the Interactions?,"When viruses infect cells, they almost invariably cause metabolic changes in the infected cell as well as in several host cell types that react to the infection. Such metabolic changes provide potential targets for therapeutic approaches that could reduce the impact of infection. Several examples are discussed in this review, which include effects on energy metabolism, glutaminolysis and fatty acid metabolism. The response of the immune system also involves metabolic changes and manipulating these may change the outcome of infection. This could include changing the status of herpesviruses infections from productive to latency. The consequences of viral infections which include coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), may also differ in patients with metabolic problems, such as diabetes mellitus (DM), obesity, and endocrine diseases. Nutrition status may also affect the pattern of events following viral infection and examples that impact on the pattern of human and experimental animal viral diseases and the mechanisms involved are discussed. Finally, we discuss the so far few published reports that have manipulated metabolic events <i>in-vivo</i> to change the outcome of virus infection. The topic is expected to expand in relevance as an approach used alone or in combination with other therapies to shape the nature of virus induced diseases.",Sumbria D; Berber E; Mathayan M; Rouse BT,Frontiers in immunology,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33613518/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33607573,Immune-mediated enteropathies: From bench to bedside.,"Immune-mediated enteropathies are caused by excessive reactions of the intestinal immune system towards non-pathogenic molecules. Enteropathy leads to malabsorption-related symptoms and include (severe) chronic diarrhea, weight loss and vitamin deficiencies. Parenteral feeding and immunosuppressive therapy are needed in severe cases. Celiac disease has long been recognized as the most common immune-mediated enteropathy in adults, but the spectrum of immune-mediated enteropathies has been expanding. Histological and clinical features are sometimes shared among these enteropathies, and therefore it may be challenging to differentiate between them. Here, we provide an overview of immune-mediated enteropathies focused on clinical presentation, establishing diagnosis, immunopathogenesis, and treatment options.",van Wanrooij RLJ; Bontkes HJ; Neefjes-Borst EA; Mulder CJ; Bouma G,Journal of autoimmunity,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33607573/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33603741,Regulation of Intestinal Inflammation by Dietary Fats.,"With the epidemic of human obesity, dietary fats have increasingly become a focal point of biomedical research. Epidemiological studies indicate that high-fat diets (HFDs), especially those rich in long-chain saturated fatty acids (e.g., Western Diet, National Health Examination survey; NHANES 'What We Eat in America' report) have multi-organ pro-inflammatory effects. Experimental studies have confirmed some of these disease associations, and have begun to elaborate mechanisms of disease induction. However, many of the observed effects from epidemiological studies appear to be an over-simplification of the mechanistic complexity that depends on dynamic interactions between the host, the particular fatty acid, and the rather personalized genetics and variability of the gut microbiota. Of interest, experimental studies have shown that certain saturated fats (e.g., lauric and myristic fatty acid-rich coconut oil) could exert the opposite effect; that is, desirable anti-inflammatory and protective mechanisms promoting gut health by unanticipated pathways. Owing to the experimental advantages of laboratory animals for the study of mechanisms under well-controlled dietary settings, we focus this review on the current understanding of how dietary fatty acids impact intestinal biology. We center this discussion on studies from mice and rats, with validation in cell culture systems or human studies. We provide a scoping overview of the most studied diseases mechanisms associated with the induction or prevention of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in rodent models relevant to Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis after feeding either high-fat diet (HFD) or feed containing specific fatty acid or other target dietary molecule. Finally, we provide a general outlook on areas that have been largely or scarcely studied, and assess the effects of HFDs on acute and chronic forms of intestinal inflammation.",Basson AR; Chen C; Sagl F; Trotter A; Bederman I; Gomez-Nguyen A; Sundrud MS; Ilic S; Cominelli F; Rodriguez-Palacios A,Frontiers in immunology,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33603741/,0,1,0,0,0,0
33597015,Fetal liver hematopoiesis: from development to delivery.,"Clinical transplants of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) can provide a lifesaving therapy for many hematological diseases; however, therapeutic applications are hampered by donor availability. In vivo, HSC exist in a specified microenvironment called the niche. While most studies of the niche focus on those residing in the bone marrow (BM), a better understanding of the fetal liver niche during development is vital to design human pluripotent stem cell (PSC) culture and may provide valuable insights with regard to expanding HSCs ex vivo for transplantation. This review will discuss the importance of the fetal liver niche in HSC expansion, a feat that occurs during development and has great clinical potential. We will also discuss emerging approaches to generate expandable HSC in cell culture that attain more complexity in the form of cells or organoid models in combination with engineering and systems biology approaches. Overall, delivering HSC by charting developmental principles will help in the understanding of the molecular and biological interactions between HSCs and fetal liver cells for their controlled maturation and expansion.",Lewis K; Yoshimoto M; Takebe T,Stem cell research & therapy,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33597015/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33584724,The Role of the Adipokine Leptin in Immune Cell Function in Health and Disease.,"Leptin is a critical mediator of the immune response to changes in overall nutrition. Leptin is produced by adipocytes in proportion to adipose tissue mass and is therefore increased in obesity. Despite having a well-described role in regulating systemic metabolism and appetite, leptin displays pleiotropic actions, and it is now clear that leptin has a key role in influencing immune cell function. Indeed, many immune cells have been shown to respond to leptin directly <i>via</i> the leptin receptor, resulting in a largely pro-inflammatory phenotype. Understanding the role of adipose-tissue derived mediators in inflammation is critical to determining the pathophysiology of multiple obesity-associated diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, autoimmune disease, and infection. This review, therefore, focuses on the latest data regarding the role of leptin in modulating inflammation.",Kiernan K; MacIver NJ,Frontiers in immunology,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33584724/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33581845,Exosomal microRNAs and exosomal long non-coding RNAs in gynecologic cancers.,"Gynecologic cancer is a group of any malignancies affecting reproductive tissues and organs of women, including ovaries, uterine, cervix, vagina, vulva, and endometrium. Several types of molecular mechanisms are associated with the progression of gynecologic cancers. Among it can be referred to the most widely studied non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), specifically microRNAs (miRNAs) and long ncRNAs (lncRNAs). As yet, lncRNAs are known to serve key biological roles via various mechanisms, such as splicing regulation, chromatin rearrangement, translation regulation, cell-cycle control, genetic imprinting and mRNA decay. Besides, miRNAs govern gene expression by modulation of mRNAs and lncRNAs degradation, suggestive of needing more research in this field. Generally, driving gynecological cancers pathways by miRNAs and lncRNAs lead to the current improvement in cancer-related technologies. Exosomes are extracellular microvesicles which can carry cargo molecules among cells. In recent years, more studies have been focused on exosomal non-coding RNAs (exo-ncRNAs) and exosomal microRNAs (exo-miRs) because of being natural carriers of lnc RNAs and microRNAs via programmed process. In this review we summarized recent reports concerning the function of exosomal microRNAs and exosomal long non-coding RNAs in gynecological cancers.",Hashemipour M; Boroumand H; Mollazadeh S; Tajiknia V; Nourollahzadeh Z; Rohani Borj M; Pourghadamyari H; Rahimian N; Hamblin MR; Mirzaei H,Gynecologic oncology,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33581845/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33579423,NAFLD-related HCC.,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the major drivers for the rising trend in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Over the past three decades, the incidence of both NAFLD and HCC have increased two- to threefold. It has been forecasted that the number of patients with NAFLD in the Unites States will reach 101 million by 2030; global increase is also foreseen. This trend will likely continue to translate into increased HCC in the Unites States and across the globe. In this chapter, we summarize the current evidence linking NAFLD, metabolic syndrome, particularly obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and HCC. We describe the main molecular mechanisms connecting these metabolic perturbations and hepatocarcinogenesis.",Banini BA; Sanyal AJ,Advances in cancer research,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33579423/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33566325,"Sarcopenia, immune-mediated rheumatic diseases, and nutritional interventions.","Sarcopenia is defined by a loss of muscle mass and function associated with mortality, decreased physical performance, falls, and disability. Since chronic inflammation and decreased physical activity are risk factors for developing sarcopenia, it is critical to assess the role of sarcopenia in immune-mediated rheumatic diseases (IMRDs). Moreover, nutritional interventions are emerging as key modifiable and affordable options to improve physical performance in sarcopenia. The aim of this review is to critically summarize current information on the evidence linking nutritional interventions and sarcopenia in IMRDs. The search and selection of articles was performed in Medline, Dimensions.ai, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Epistemonikos, and Trip Database. The results were clustered into three areas: sarcopenia and IMRDs, sarcopenia and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs), and nutritional interventions for sarcopenia. Several cross-sectional studies have shown a higher prevalence of sarcopenia in IMRDs, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Although not fully established, evidence linking sarcopenia and other IMRDs (ankylosing spondylitis and systemic sclerosis) has been also described. For secondary sarcopenia prevention and treatment, bDMARDs' administration proved efficacy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, there is growing evidence linking nutrition to the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia. Evidence linking unfavourable results in nutritional risk assessment, insufficient intake of protein, vitamin D, antioxidant nutrients, and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and sarcopenia have been reported. Given that sarcopenia and IMRDs have strong links, further research is needed to improve patient care.",Cruz-Jentoft AJ; Romero-Yuste S; Chamizo Carmona E; Nolla JM,Aging clinical and experimental research,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33566325/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33554318,Parenteral Nutrition and Cardiotoxicity.,"Parenteral nutrition (PN) is a life-saving nutritional therapy for those situations when patients are unable to receive enteral nutrition. However, despite a multitude of benefits offered by PN, it is associated with a variety of side effects, most notably parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD). Adverse effects of PN on other organ systems, such as brain and cardiovascular system, have been poorly studied. There have been several case reports, studies, and a recent animal study highlighting cardiotoxic effects of PN; however, much remains unclear about the underlying mechanisms causing cardiac damage. In this review, we propose a series of potential mechanisms behind PN-associated heart injury, and we provide an overview of therapeutic strategies and recent scientific advances.",van Nispen J; Voigt M; Song E; Armstrong A; Fedorova M; Murali V; Krebs J; Samaddar A; Manithody C; Jain A,Cardiovascular toxicology,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33554318/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33542406,A systematic review and meta-analysis on the clinical implications of probability discounting among individuals with Internet gaming disorder.,"The significance of probability discounting (PD) among individuals with Internet gaming disorder (IGD) remains unclear. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched the PubMed, Embase, and ScienceDirect databases for English articles on Internet addiction that included comparison between individuals with and without IGD as well as probabilistic discounting task as the main outcome from January 1970 to July 2020 using the appropriate keyword strings. The primary outcome was the overall difference in rate of PD, while the secondary outcomes included the difference in PD with magnitude of probabilistic reward and response time of the PD task. Effect size (ES) was calculated through dividing the group means (e.g., h value or AUC) by the pooled standard deviations of the two groups. A total of five studies with 300 participants (i.e., IGD group, n = 150, mean age = 20.27 ± 2.68; healthy controls, n = 150, mean age = 20.70 ± 2.81) were analyzed. The IGD group was more willing to take risks in probabilistic gains but performances on probabilistic losses were similar between the two groups. The IGD group also exhibited a shorter response time (Hedge's g = - 0.51; 95%CI = - 0.87 to - 0.15). Meta-regression demonstrated a positive correlation between maximum reward magnitude and PD rate (p < 0.04). However, significant publication bias was noted among the included studies (Egger's test, p < 0.01). In conclusion, individuals with IGD seemed more impulsive in making risky decisions, especially when the potential gains were expected. Our findings not only supported the use of PD for assessing individuals with IGD but may also provide new insights into appropriate interventions.",Chung W; Sun CK; Tsai IT; Hung KC; Chiu HJ; Tzang RF; Yeh PY; Cheng YS,Scientific reports,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33542406/,0,1,0,1,0,0

This informatics PP partnership consortium comprised private and public sectors. A database of pharmacokinetic (PK) and cardiotoxic properties was developed, with considerable expansion after integrating proprietary data from private-sector members.

33509399,Supplemental Vitamins and Minerals for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention and Treatment: JACC Focus Seminar.,"This is an update of the previous 2018 systematic review and meta-analysis of vitamin and mineral supplementation on cardiovascular disease outcomes and all-cause mortality. New randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses were identified by searching the Cochrane library, Medline, and Embase, and data were analyzed using random effects models and classified by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation approach. This updated review shows similar findings to the previous report for preventive benefits from both folic acid and B vitamins for stroke and has been graded with moderate quality. No effect was seen for the commonly used multivitamins, vitamin D, calcium, and vitamin C, and an increased risk was seen with niacin (with statin) for all-cause mortality. Conclusive evidence for the benefit of supplements across different dietary backgrounds, when the nutrient is sufficient, has not been demonstrated.",Jenkins DJA; Spence JD; Giovannucci EL; Kim YI; Josse RG; Vieth R; Sahye-Pudaruth S; Paquette M; Patel D; Blanco Mejia S; Viguiliouk E; Nishi SK; Kavanagh M; Tsirakis T; Kendall CWC; Pichika SC; Sievenpiper JL,Journal of the American College of Cardiology,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33509399/,0,1,0,1,0,0
33509307,"Diets, nutrients, genes and the microbiome: recent advances in personalised nutrition.","As individuals seek increasingly individualised nutrition and lifestyle guidance, numerous apps and nutrition programmes have emerged. However, complex individual variations in dietary behaviours, genotypes, gene expression and composition of the microbiome are increasingly recognised. Advances in digital tools and artificial intelligence can help individuals more easily track nutrient intakes and identify nutritional gaps. However, the influence of these nutrients on health outcomes can vary widely among individuals depending upon life stage, genetics and microbial composition. For example, folate may elicit favourable epigenetic effects on brain development during a critical developmental time window of pregnancy. Genes affecting vitamin B12 metabolism may lead to cardiometabolic traits that play an essential role in the context of obesity. Finally, an individual's gut microbial composition can determine their response to dietary fibre interventions during weight loss. These recent advances in understanding can lead to a more complete and integrated approach to promoting optimal health through personalised nutrition, in clinical practice settings and for individuals in their daily lives. The purpose of this review is to summarise presentations made during the DSM Science and Technology Award Symposium at the 13th European Nutrition Conference, which focused on personalised nutrition and novel technologies for health in the modern world.",Matusheski NV; Caffrey A; Christensen L; Mezgec S; Surendran S; Hjorth MF; McNulty H; Pentieva K; Roager HM; Seljak BK; Vimaleswaran KS; Remmers M; Péter S,The British journal of nutrition,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33509307/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33505947,Early Diagnosis and Intervention in Cystic Fibrosis: Imagining the Unimaginable.,"Cystic fibrosis is the most common life-shortening genetic disease affecting Caucasians, clinically manifested by fat malabsorption, poor growth and nutrition, and recurrent sinopulmonary infections. Newborn screening programs for cystic fibrosis are now implemented throughout the United States and in many nations worldwide. Early diagnosis and interventions have led to improved clinical outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis. Newer cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator potentiators and correctors with mutation-specific effects have increasingly been used in children, and these agents are revolutionizing care. Indeed, it is possible that highly effective modulator therapy used early in life could profoundly affect the trajectory of cystic fibrosis lung disease, and primary prevention may be achievable.",Coverstone AM; Ferkol TW,Frontiers in pediatrics,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33505947/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33482357,Could targeting immunometabolism be a way to control the burden of COVID-19 infection?,This review portrays the metabolic consequences of Covid-19 infection at different stages of the clinical syndrome. It also describes how events can change when patients with metabolic problems are infected and the effects that diet and nutrition might play to influence the outcome of infection. We also discuss the types of maneuvers that could be used to reshape metabolic events and question if this approach could be a practical therapy used alone or in combination with other approaches to reduce the burden of Covid-19 infection.,Berber E; Sumbria D; Rouse BT,Microbes and infection,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33482357/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33471743,Exocrine Pancreas Dysfunction in Type 1 Diabetes.,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by autoimmune β-cell destruction, but exocrine pancreas abnormalities may also play a role in the disease pathophysiology. Herein, we review the current evidence of exocrine damage in T1D and discuss its underlying pathophysiology, clinical evaluation, and treatment. Extensive literature search was performed for ""type 1 diabetes"" and ""exocrine dysfunction"" on PubMed and Google Scholar databases. T1D pancreata are significantly smaller than controls, both in weight and volume. T cells, dendritic cells, neutrophils, and products of complement activation are seen in T1D exocrine tissues. Exocrine pancreas fibrosis, arteriosclerosis, fatty infiltration, and acinar atrophy are also observed on histology. Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) can be assessed through direct exocrine testing, fecal elastase concentration, and measurement of serum exocrine enzymes. The prevalence of PEI in T1D varies by modality and study but is consistently greater than controls. The clinical relevance of PEI in T1D is debatable, as many patients with laboratory evidence of PEI are asymptomatic. However, in PEI-symptomatic patients reported benefits of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) include relief of gastrointestinal symptoms, improved quality of life, better glycemic control, and optimal nutrition. Exocrine pancreas abnormalities often occur in T1D. Whether exocrine dysfunction occurs simultaneously with β-cell destruction, as a result of β-cell loss, or as a combination of both remains to be definitively answered. In T1D with gastrointestinal complaints, PEI should be evaluated, usually via fecal elastase measurements. PERT is recommended for T1D patients with symptoms and laboratory evidence of PEI. AAb+ = autoantibody positive; AAb- = autoantibody negative; FEC = fecal elastase concentration; PEI = pancreatic exocrine insufficiency; PERT = pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy; PP = pancreatic polypep-tide; T1D = type 1 diabetes.",Foster TP; Bruggeman B; Campbell-Thompson M; Atkinson MA; Haller MJ; Schatz DA,Endocrine practice : official journal of the American College of Endocrinology and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33471743/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33446330,Replication and meta-analyses nominate numerous eosinophilic esophagitis risk genes.,"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an emerging, chronic, rare allergic disease associated with marked eosinophil accumulation in the esophagus. Previous genome-wide association studies have provided strong evidence for 3 genome-wide susceptibility loci. We sought to replicate known and suggestive EoE genetic risk loci and conduct a meta-analysis of previously reported data sets. An EoE-Custom single-nucleotide polymophism (SNP) Chip containing 956 candidate EoE risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms was used to genotype 627 cases and 365 controls. Statistical power was enhanced by adding 1959 external controls and performing meta-analyses with 2 independent EoE genome-wide association studies. Meta-analysis identified replicated association and genome-wide significance at 6 loci: 2p23 (2 independent genetic effects) and 5q22, 10p14, 11q13, and 16p13. Seven additional loci were identified at suggestive significance (P < 10<sup>-6</sup>): 1q31, 5q23, 6q15, 6q21, 8p21, 17q12, and 22q13. From these risk loci, 13 protein-coding EoE candidate risk genes were expressed in a genotype-dependent manner. EoE risk genes were expressed in disease-relevant cell types, including esophageal epithelia, fibroblasts, and immune cells, with some expressed as a function of disease activity. The genetic risk burden of EoE-associated genetic variants was markedly larger in cases relative to controls (P < 10<sup>-38</sup>); individuals with the highest decile of genetic burden had greater than 12-fold risk of EoE compared with those within the lowest decile. This study extends the genetic underpinnings of EoE, highlighting 13 genes whose genotype-dependent expression expands our etiologic understanding of EoE and provides a framework for a polygenic risk score to be validated in future studies.",Kottyan LC; Trimarchi MP; Lu X; Caldwell JM; Maddox A; Parameswaran S; Lape M; D'Mello RJ; Bonfield M; Ballaban A; Mukkada V; Putnam PE; Abonia P; Ben-Baruch Morgenstern N; Eapen AA; Wen T; Weirauch MT; Rothenberg ME,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33446330/,0,1,0,1,0,0

This article catalogs the areas of progress and areas for further research. Through our personal experiences in caring for patients with FPIES, our personal research, and a review of the existing FPIES literature as indexed in PubMed, we explored what is known and what is needed in FPIES. The studies that have improved the knowledge of FPIES, defined phenotypes, allowed for better-informed management of FPIES, and laid the groundwork for further research. Further research is needed in the areas of prevalence, natural history, trigger foods, threshold doses, how and when to perform oral food challenges, and immunopathogenesis of this disorder. Development of a biomarker and determination of the best method to treat reactions is also needed. Furthermore, FPIES has a substantial psychosocial and economic impact on families, and more research is needed in developing and implementing ameliorating strategies. By partnering together, health care providers, advocacy organizations, and families can continue to advance our understanding and improve the care of patients and families living with FPIES.",Bartnikas LM; Nowak-Wegrzyn A; Schultz F; Phipatanakul W; Bingemann TA,"Annals of allergy, asthma & immunology : official publication of the American College of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology",2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33444729/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33430873,Effects of therapeutic probiotics on modulation of microRNAs.,"Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that exist within the human gut, and which are also present in different food products and supplements. They have been investigated for some decades, due to their potential beneficial impact on human health. Probiotics compete with pathogenic microorganisms for adhesion sites within the gut, to antagonize them or to regulate the host immune response resulting in preventive and therapeutic effects. Therefore, dysbiosis, defined as an impairment in the gut microbiota, could play a role in various pathological conditions, such as lactose intolerance, gastrointestinal and urogenital infections, various cancers, cystic fibrosis, allergies, inflammatory bowel disease, and can also be caused by antibiotic side effects. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that can regulate gene expression in a post-transcriptional manner. miRNAs are biochemical biomarkers that play an important role in almost all cellular signaling pathways in many healthy and disease states. For the first time, the present review summarizes current evidence suggesting that the beneficial properties of probiotics could be explained based on the pivotal role of miRNAs.

33412425,Genomic resources in plant breeding for sustainable agriculture.,"Climate change during the last 40 years has had a serious impact on agriculture and threatens global food and nutritional security. From over half a million plant species, cereals and legumes are the most important for food and nutritional security. Although systematic plant breeding has a relatively short history, conventional breeding coupled with advances in technology and crop management strategies has increased crop yields by 56 % globally between 1965-85, referred to as the Green Revolution. Nevertheless, increased demand for food, feed, fiber, and fuel necessitates the need to break existing yield barriers in many crop plants. In the first decade of the 21st century we witnessed rapid discovery, transformative technological development and declining costs of genomics technologies. In the second decade, the field turned towards making sense of the vast amount of genomic information and subsequently moved towards accurately predicting gene-to-phenotype associations and tailoring plants for climate resilience and global food security. In this review we focus on genomic resources, genome and germplasm sequencing, sequencing-based trait mapping, and genomics-assisted breeding approaches aimed at developing biotic stress resistant, abiotic stress tolerant and high nutrition varieties in six major cereals (rice, maize, wheat, barley, sorghum and pearl millet), and six major legumes (soybean, groundnut, cowpea, common bean, chickpea and pigeonpea). We further provide a perspective and way forward to use genomic breeding approaches including marker-assisted selection, marker-assisted backcrossing, haplotype based breeding and genomic prediction approaches coupled with machine learning and artificial intelligence, to speed breeding approaches. The overall goal is to accelerate genetic gains and deliver climate resilient and high nutrition crop varieties for sustainable agriculture.",Thudi M; Palakurthi R; Schnable JC; Chitikineni A; Dreisigacker S; Mace E; Srivastava RK; Satyavathi CT; Odeny D; Tiwari VK; Lam HM; Hong YB; Singh VK; Li G; Xu Y; Chen X; Kaila S; Nguyen H; Sivasankar S; Jackson SA; Close TJ; Shubo W; Varshney RK,Journal of plant physiology,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33412425/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33401401,Microbiota-Mediated Immune Regulation in Atherosclerosis.,"There is a high level of interest in identifying metabolites of endogenously produced or dietary compounds generated by the gastrointestinal (GI) tract microbiota, and determining the functions of these metabolites in health and disease. There is a wealth of compelling evidence that the microbiota is linked with many complex chronic inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis. Macrophages are key target immune cells in atherosclerosis. A hallmark of atherosclerosis is the accumulation of pro-inflammatory macrophages in coronary arteries that respond to pro-atherogenic stimuli and failure of digesting lipids that contribute to foam cell formation in atherosclerotic plaques. This review illustrates the role of tryptophan-derived microbiota metabolites as an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligand that has immunomodulatory properties. Also, microbiota-dependent trimethylamine-<i>N</i>-oxide (TMAO) metabolite production is associated with a deleterious effect that promotes atherosclerosis, and metabolite indoxyl sulfate has been shown to exacerbate atherosclerosis. Our objective in this review is to discuss the role of microbiota-derived metabolites in atherosclerosis, specifically the consequences of microbiota-induced effects of innate immunity in response to atherogenic stimuli, and how specific beneficial/detrimental metabolites impact the development of atherosclerosis by regulating chronic endotoxemic and lipotoxic inflammation.",Eshghjoo S; Jayaraman A; Sun Y; Alaniz RC,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33401401/,1,0,0,0,0,0

In this review, we examine the contribution that non-nutritional anemia makes to incidence in Indonesia. Anemia due to helminthiasis is a common problem in Indonesia and contributes to prevalence, particularly in children under 5 years. We conducted a systematic literature review based on Google Scholar and Pubmed for non-nutritional anemia.

First, we outline how receptor-binding proteins and their relevant structural domains are engineered to redirect phage specificity and to avoid resistance. Next, we summarize how phages are reprogrammed as prokaryotic gene therapy vectors that deliver antimicrobial 'payload' proteins, such as sequence-specific nucleases, to target defined cells within complex microbiomes. Finally, we delineate big data- and novel artificial intelligence-driven approaches that may guide the design of improved synthetic phage in the future.",Lenneman BR; Fernbach J; Loessner MJ; Lu TK; Kilcher S,Current opinion in biotechnology,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33310655/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33306994,Articulating the effect of food systems innovation on the Sustainable Development Goals.,"Food system innovations will be instrumental to achieving multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, major innovation breakthroughs can trigger profound and disruptive changes, leading to simultaneous and interlinked reconfigurations of multiple parts of the global food system. The emergence of new technologies or social solutions, therefore, have very different impact profiles, with favourable consequences for some SDGs and unintended adverse side-effects for others. Stand-alone innovations seldom achieve positive outcomes over multiple sustainability dimensions. Instead, they should be embedded as part of systemic changes that facilitate the implementation of the SDGs. Emerging trade-offs need to be intentionally addressed to achieve true sustainability, particularly those involving social aspects like inequality in its many forms, social justice, and strong institutions, which remain challenging. Trade-offs with undesirable consequences are manageable through the development of well planned transition pathways, careful monitoring of key indicators, and through the implementation of transparent science targets at the local level.",Herrero M; Thornton PK; Mason-D'Croz D; Palmer J; Bodirsky BL; Pradhan P; Barrett CB; Benton TG; Hall A; Pikaar I; Bogard JR; Bonnett GD; Bryan BA; Campbell BM; Christensen S; Clark M; Fanzo J; Godde CM; Jarvis A; Loboguerrero AM; Mathys A; McIntyre CL; Naylor RL; Nelson R; Obersteiner M; Parodi A; Popp A; Ricketts K; Smith P; Valin H; Vermeulen SJ; Vervoort J; van Wijk M; van Zanten HH; West PC; Wood SA; Rockström J,The Lancet.

33298891,Liquid biopsies and cancer omics.,"The development of the sequencing technologies allowed the generation of huge amounts of molecular data from a single cancer specimen, allowing the clinical oncology to enter the era of the precision medicine. This massive amount of data is highlighting new details on cancer pathogenesis but still relies on tissue biopsies, which are unable to capture the dynamic nature of cancer through its evolution. This assumption led to the exploration of non-tissue sources of tumoral material opening the field of liquid biopsies. Blood, together with body fluids such as urines, or stool, from cancer patients, are analyzed applying the techniques used for the generation of omics data. With blood, this approach would allow to take into account tumor heterogeneity (since the circulating components such as CTCs, ctDNA, or ECVs derive from each cancer clone) in a time dependent manner, resulting in a somehow ""real-time"" understanding of cancer evolution.

33292806,Geographical distribution of hyperuricemia in mainland China: a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Fructose plays an important role in the complex metabolism of uric acid in the human body. However, high blood uric acid concentration, known as hyperuricemia, is the main risk factor for development of gout. Therefore, we conducted an updated meta-analysis on the prevalence and geographical distribution of hyperuricemia among the general population in mainland China using systematic literature search. Five electronic databases were used to search for relevant articles published until 2019. All calculations were conducted using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software. We included 108 eligible articles (172 studies by sex, 95 studies by regions, and 107 studies by study type) and an overall sample size of > 808,505 participants. The pooled prevalence of hyperuricemia among the general population in mainland China was 17.4% (95% CI: 15.8-19.1%). Our subgroup analysis indicated that the pooled prevalence by regions ranged from 15.5 to 24.6%. Those living Northeast region and being males had the highest prevalence (P < 0.001). In addition, some provinces in South Central, East and Northeast regions reported a high prevalence (> 20%), particularly in males. An increasing prevalence was reported since 2005-2009 until 2015-2019. No publication of bias was observed as indicated by a symmetrical funnel plot and Begg and Mazumdar rank correlation (P = 0.392). Prevalence of hyperuricemia is increasing in China, and future studies should investigate the association between the prevalence of hyperuricemia and its risk factors in order to tackle the issue, particularly among the vulnerable groups. Also, our study was the first comprehensive study to investigate the overall prevalence of hyperuricemia in mainland China covering the six different regions.",Huang J; Ma ZF; Zhang Y; Wan Z; Li Y; Zhou H; Chu A; Lee YY,Global health research and policy,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33292806/,0,1,0,1,0,0
33249867,Artificial intelligence and synthetic biology approaches for human gut microbiome.,"The gut microbiome comprises a variety of microorganisms whose genes encode proteins to carry out crucial metabolic functions that are responsible for the majority of health-related issues in human beings. The advent of the technological revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) assisted synthetic biology (SB) approaches will play a vital role in the modulating the therapeutic and nutritive potential of probiotics. This can turn human gut as a reservoir of beneficial bacterial colonies having an immense role in immunity, digestion, brain function, and other health benefits. Hence, in the present review, we have discussed the role of several gene editing tools and approaches in synthetic biology that have equipped us with novel tools like Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR-Cas) systems to precisely engineer probiotics for diagnostic, therapeutic and nutritive value. A brief discussion over the AI techniques to understand the metagenomic data from the healthy and diseased gut microbiome is also presented. Further, the role of AI in potentially impacting the pace of developments in SB and its current challenges is also discussed. The review also describes the health benefits conferred by engineered microbes through the production of biochemicals, nutraceuticals, drugs or biotherapeutics molecules etc. Finally, the review concludes with the challenges and regulatory concerns in adopting synthetic biology engineered microbes for clinical applications. Thus, the review presents a synergistic approach of AI and SB toward human gut microbiome for better health which will provide interesting clues to researchers working in the area of rapidly evolving food and nutrition science.",Kumar P; Sinha R; Shukla P,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33249867/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33236377,Linking nutrient sensing and gene expression in Plasmodium falciparum blood-stage parasites.,"Malaria is one of the most life-threatening infectious diseases worldwide, caused by infection of humans with parasites of the genus Plasmodium. The complex life cycle of Plasmodium parasites is shared between two hosts, with infection of multiple cell types, and the parasite needs to adapt for survival and transmission through significantly different metabolic environments. Within the blood-stage alone, parasites encounter changing levels of key nutrients, including sugars, amino acids, and lipids, due to differences in host dietary nutrition, cellular tropism, and pathogenesis. In this review, we consider the mechanisms that the most lethal of malaria parasites, Plasmodium falciparum, uses to sense nutrient levels and elicit changes in gene expression during blood-stage infections. These changes are brought about by several metabolic intermediates and their corresponding sensor proteins. Sensing of distinct nutritional signals can drive P. falciparum to alter the key blood-stage processes of proliferation, antigenic variation, and transmission.",Kumar M; Skillman K; Duraisingh MT,Molecular microbiology,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33236377/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33230198,Personalized nutrition approach in pediatrics: a narrative review.,"Dietary habits represent the main determinant of health. Although extensive research has been conducted to modify unhealthy dietary behaviors across the lifespan, obesity and obesity-associated comorbidities are increasingly observed worldwide. Individually tailored interventions are nowadays considered a promising frontier for nutritional research. In this narrative review, the technologies of importance in a pediatric clinical setting are discussed. The first determinant of the dietary balance is represented by energy intakes matching individual needs. Most emerging studies highlight the opportunity to reconsider the widely used prediction equations of resting energy expenditure. Artificial Neural Network approaches may help to disentangle the role of single contributors to energy expenditure. Artificial intelligence is also useful in the prediction of the glycemic response, based on the individual microbiome. Other factors further concurring to define individually tailored nutritional needs are metabolomics and nutrigenomic. Since most available data come from studies in adult groups, new efforts should now be addressed to integrate all these aspects to develop comprehensive and-above all-effective interventions for children. IMPACT: Personalized dietary advice, specific to individuals, should be more effective in the prevention of chronic diseases than general recommendations about diet. Artificial Neural Networks algorithms are technologies of importance in a pediatric setting that may help practitioners to provide personalized nutrition. Other approaches to personalized nutrition, while promising in adults and for basic research, are still far from practical application in pediatrics.",Milani GP; Silano M; Mazzocchi A; Bettocchi S; De Cosmi V; Agostoni C,Pediatric research,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33230198/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33222799,Preventive malaria treatment among school-aged children in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review and meta-analyses.,"The burden of malaria infection in sub-Saharan Africa among school-aged children aged 5-15 years is underappreciated and represents an important source of human-to-mosquito transmission of Plasmodium falciparum. Additional interventions are needed to control and eliminate malaria. We aimed to assess whether preventive treatment of malaria might be an effective means of reducing P falciparum infection and anaemia in school-aged children and lowering parasite transmission. In this systematic review and two meta-analyses, we searched the online databases PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Clinicaltrials.gov for intervention studies published between Jan 1, 1990, and Dec 14, 2018. We included randomised studies that assessed the effect of antimalarial treatment among asymptomatic school-aged children aged 5-15 years in sub-Saharan Africa on prevalence of P falciparum infection and anaemia, clinical malaria, and cognitive function. We first extracted data for a study-level meta-analysis, then contacted research groups to request data for an individual participant data meta-analysis. Outcomes of interest included prevalence of P falciparum infection detected by microscopy, anaemia (study defined values or haemoglobin less than age-adjusted and sex-adjusted values), clinical malaria (infection and symptoms on the basis of study-specific definitions) during follow-up, and code transmission test scores. We assessed effects by treatment type and duration of time protected, and explored effect modification by transmission setting. For study-level meta-analysis, we calculated risk ratios for binary outcomes and standardised mean differences for continuous outcomes and pooled outcomes using fixed-effect and random-effects models. We used a hierarchical generalised linear model for meta-analysis of individual participant data. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42016030197. Of 628 studies identified, 13 were eligible for the study-level meta-analysis (n=16 309). Researchers from 11 studies contributed data on at least one outcome (n=15 658) for an individual participant data meta-analysis. Interventions and study designs were highly heterogeneous; overall risk of bias was low. In the study-level meta-analysis, treatment was associated with reductions in P falciparum prevalence (risk ratio [RR] 0·27, 95% CI 0·17-0·44), anaemia (0·77, 0·65-0·91), and clinical malaria (0·40, 0·28-0·56); results for cognitive outcomes are not presented because data were only available for three trials. In our individual participant data meta-analysis, we found treatment significantly decreased P falciparum prevalence (adjusted RR [ARR] 0·46, 95% CI 0·40-0·53; p<0·0001; 15 648 individuals; 11 studies), anaemia (ARR 0·85, 0·77-0·92; p<0·0001; 15 026 individuals; 11 studies), and subsequent clinical malaria (ARR 0·50, 0·39-0·60; p<0·0001; 1815 individuals; four studies) across transmission settings. We detected a marginal effect on cognitive function in children older than 10 years (adjusted mean difference in standardised test scores 0·36, 0·01-0·71; p=0·044; 3962 individuals; five studies) although we found no significant effect when combined across all ages. Preventive treatment of malaria among school-aged children significantly decreases P falciparum prevalence, anaemia, and risk of subsequent clinical malaria across transmission settings. Policy makers and programme managers should consider preventive treatment of malaria to protect this age group and advance the goal of malaria elimination, while weighing these benefits against potential risks of chemoprevention.

33203217,Minerals in edible seaweed: health benefits and food safety issues.,"An adequate daily intake of minerals is essential for the prevention of chronic nutrition-related and degenerative diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. Seaweeds are marine aquatic vegetable that are rich in nutrients. They also have a natural and sustainable origin and clean and renewable sources when they come from marine aquaculture or controlled fisheries. Seaweeds have high nutritional value as a source of polyunsaturated fatty acids, proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and especially minerals. They are known for their high mineral content, which is gathered from seawater depending on the seasonal variation and the environment. Seaweeds are consequently rich in macro-elements and trace elements, with a mineral content at least 10 times higher than terrestrial plants and reaching 20-50% of its dry weight. Therefore, seaweeds can make an important contribution to the daily intake of minerals and are a promising source of essential minerals for functional food, food supplements, and nutraceuticals. The aim of the present review is to compare the contents of essential minerals (K, Ca, Na, P, Cu, Fe, Se, Mn, Zn, Mg, Cr, and I) as well as potential toxic minerals (Hg, Pb, Cd, As, and Al) in 14 main edible seaweeds that have availability of biomass from harvest and aquaculture. Another goal is to establish their safety in foods and contributions to the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) and adequate intake (AI) values.",Lozano Muñoz I; Díaz NF,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33203217/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Studies were identified through systematic literature search in Embase, Medline and Web of Science (9 August 2019) and through personal contacts. Eligible studies had to be published between 2000 and 2017 with data on sleep assessed with questionnaires including ≥100 participants from the general population. We assembled individual participant data from 200,358 people (aged 1-100 years, 55% female) from 36 studies from the Netherlands, 471,759 people (40-69 years, 55.5% female) from the United Kingdom and 409,617 people (≥18 years, 55.8% female) from the United States. One in four people slept less than age-specific recommendations, but only 5.8% slept outside of the 'acceptable' sleep duration. Among teenagers, 51.5% reported total sleep times (TST) of less than the recommended 8-10 h and 18% report daytime sleepiness. In adults (≥18 years), poor sleep quality (13.3%) and insomnia symptoms (9.6-19.4%) were more prevalent than short sleep duration (6.5% with TST < 6 h). Insomnia symptoms were most frequent in people spending ≥9 h in bed, whereas poor sleep quality was more frequent in those spending <6 h in bed. TST was similar across countries, but insomnia symptoms were 1.5-2.9 times higher in the United States. Women (≥41 years) reported sleeping shorter times or slightly less efficiently than men, whereas with actigraphy they were estimated to sleep longer and more efficiently than man.

These Gram-positive, encapsulated bacterial pathogens infect diverse anatomic spaces, leading to infections including skin and soft tissue infection, endocarditis, pneumonia, meningitis, sinusitis, otitis media, chorioamnionitis, sepsis, and even death. Risk for streptococcal infection is highest in low- and middle-income countries where micronutrient deficiency is common. Epidemiological data reveal that vitamin D deficiency is associated with enhanced risk of streptococcal infection and cognate disease outcomes. Additionally, vitamin D improves antibacterial defenses by stimulating innate immune processes such as phagocytosis and enhancing production of reactive oxygen species (oxidative burst) and antimicrobial peptides (including cathelicidin and lactoferrin), which are important for efficient killing of bacteria.

33057945,Artificial Intelligence and Its Role in Identifying Esophageal Neoplasia.,"Randomized trials have demonstrated that ablation of dysplastic Barrett's esophagus can reduce the risk of progression to cancer. Endoscopic resection for early stage esophageal adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma can significantly reduce postoperative morbidity compared to esophagectomy. Unfortunately, current endoscopic surveillance technologies (e.g., high-definition white light, electronic, and dye-based chromoendoscopy) lack sensitivity at identifying subtle areas of dysplasia and cancer. Random biopsies sample only approximately 5% of the esophageal mucosa at risk, and there is poor agreement among pathologists in identifying low-grade dysplasia. Machine-based deep learning medical image and video assessment technologies have progressed significantly in recent years, enabled in large part by advances in computer processing capabilities. In deep learning, sequential layers allow models to transform input data (e.g., pixels for imaging data) into a composite representation that allows for classification and feature identification. Several publications have attempted to use this technology to help identify dysplasia and early esophageal cancer. The aims of this reviews are as follows: (a) discussing limitations in our current strategies to identify esophageal dysplasia and cancer, (b) explaining the concepts behind deep learning and convolutional neural networks using language appropriate for clinicians without an engineering background, (c) systematically reviewing the literature for studies that have used deep learning to identify esophageal neoplasia, and (d) based on the systemic review, outlining strategies on further work necessary before these technologies are ready for ""prime-time,"" i.e., use in routine clinical care.",Syed T; Doshi A; Guleria S; Syed S; Shah T,Digestive diseases and sciences,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33057945/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Keratinocytes make up the main cellular constitute of the outermost layer of the skin, contributing to the formation of the epidermis, and they are crucial for maintaining the integrity of this barrier. Beyond serving as a physical barrier component, keratinocytes actively participate in maintaining tissue homeostasis, shaping, amplifying, and regulating immune responses in skin. Keratinocytes act as sentinels, continuously monitoring changes in the environment, and, through microbial sensing, stretch, or other physical stimuli, can initiate a broad range of inflammatory responses via secretion of various cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. This diverse function of keratinocytes contributes to the highly variable clinical manifestation of skin immune responses.

These factors are threatening the environmental and economic sustainability of current and future food supply systems. Scientific and technological innovations are needed more than ever to secure enough food for a fast-growing global population. Scientific advances have led to a better understanding of how various components of the agricultural system interact, from the cell to the field level. Despite incredible advances in genetic tools over the past few decades, our ability to accurately assess crop status in the field, at scale, has been severely lacking until recently. Thanks to recent advances in remote sensing and Artificial Intelligence (AI), we can now quantify field scale phenotypic information accurately and integrate the big data into predictive and prescriptive management tools. This review focuses on the use of recent technological advances in remote sensing and AI to improve the resilience of agricultural systems, and we will present a unique opportunity for the development of prescriptive tools needed to address the next decade's agricultural and human nutrition challenges.",Jung J; Maeda M; Chang A; Bhandari M; Ashapure A; Landivar-Bowles J,Current opinion in biotechnology,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33038780/,1,0,0,0,0,0

This success has been mainly due to the ability of pharmacometrics to bring together different modeling strategies, such as population pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) and systems biology/pharmacology. However, there are promising quantitative approaches that are still seldom used by pharmacometricians and that deserve consideration. One such case is the stochastic modeling approach, which can be important when modeling small populations because random events can have a huge impact on these systems. In this review, we aim to raise awareness of stochastic models and how to combine them with existing modeling techniques, with the ultimate goal of making future drug-disease models more versatile and realistic.",Irurzun-Arana I; Rackauckas C; McDonald TO; Trocóniz IF,Trends in pharmacological sciences,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33032836/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33016094,"Traceability in food processing: problems, methods, and performance evaluations-a review.","Processed food has become an indispensable part of the human food chain. It provides rich nutrition for human health and satisfies various other requirements for food consumption. However, establishing traceability systems for processed food faces a different set of challenges compared to primary agro-food, because of the variety of raw materials, batch mixing, and resource transformation. In this paper, progress in the traceability of processed food is reviewed. Based on an analysis of the food supply chain and processing stage, the problem of traceability in food processing results from the transformations that the resources go through. Methods to implement traceability in food processing, including physical separation in different lots, defining and associating batches, isotope analysis and DNA tracking, statistical data models, internal traceability system development, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain-based approaches are summarized. Traceability is evaluated based on recall effects, TRUs (traceable resource units), and comprehensive granularity. Different methods have different advantages and disadvantages. The combined application of different methods should consider the specific application scenarios in food processing to improve granularity. On the other hand, novel technologies, including batch mixing optimization with AI, quality forecasting with big data, and credible traceability with blockchain, are presented in the context of improving traceability performance in food processing.",Qian J; Dai B; Wang B; Zha Y; Song Q,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33016094/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33010278,Are fish what they eat? A fatty acid's perspective.,"Fish are the main source of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA, >C<sub>18</sub>) for human consumption. In general, it has been widely observed that the fatty acid (FA) profiles of farmed fish are reflective of the diet. However, the degree of tissue FA ""distortion"" based on incorporation of different dietary FA into fish tissues varies greatly depending on FA type, fish species and environmental factors. In terms of fish FA composition, this variation has not been comprehensively reviewed, raising the question: ""Are fish what they eat?"". To date, this remains unanswered in detail. To this end, the present review quantitatively summarized the 'diet-fish' FA relationship via an analysis of FA composition in diets and fish tissues from 290 articles published between 1998 and 2018. Comparison of this relationship among different fish species, tissue types or individual FA was summarized. Furthermore, the influence of environmental factors such as temperature and salinity, as well as of experimental conditions such as fish size and trophic level, feeding duration, and dietary lipid level on this relationship are discussed herein. Moreover, as a means of restoring LC-PUFA in fish, an emphasis was paid to the fish oil finishing strategy after long-term feeding with alternative lipid sources. It is envisaged that the present review will be beneficial in providing a more comprehensive understanding of the fundamental relationship between the FA composition in diets, and subsequently, in the farmed fish. Such information is integral to maintaining the quality of farmed fish fillets from the perspective of FA composition.",Xu H; Turchini GM; Francis DS; Liang M; Mock TS; Rombenso A; Ai Q,Progress in lipid research,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33010278/,0,1,0,0,0,0
32998213,Frontiers of Robotic Gastroscopy: A Comprehensive Review of Robotic Gastroscopes and Technologies.,"Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract pathology is common worldwide. With recent advancements in robotics, innovative diagnostic and treatment devices have been developed and several translational attempts made. This review paper aims to provide a highly pictorial critical review of robotic gastroscopes, so that clinicians and researchers can obtain a swift and comprehensive overview of key technologies and challenges. Therefore, the paper presents robotic gastroscopes, either commercial or at a progressed technology readiness level. Among them, we show tethered and wireless gastroscopes, as well as devices aimed for UGI surgery. The technological features of these instruments, as well as their clinical adoption and performance, are described and compared. Although the existing endoscopic devices have thus far provided substantial improvements in the effectiveness of diagnosis and treatment, there are certain aspects that represent unwavering predicaments of the current gastroenterology practice. A detailed list includes difficulties and risks, such as transmission of communicable diseases (e.g., COVID-19) due to the doctor-patient proximity, unchanged learning curves, variable detection rates, procedure-related adverse events, endoscopists' and nurses' burnouts, limited human and/or material resources, and patients' preferences to choose non-invasive options that further interfere with the successful implementation and adoption of routine screening. The combination of robotics and artificial intelligence, as well as remote telehealth endoscopy services, are also discussed, as viable solutions to improve existing platforms for diagnosis and treatment are emerging.",Marlicz W; Ren X; Robertson A; Skonieczna-Żydecka K; Łoniewski I; Dario P; Wang S; Plevris JN; Koulaouzidis A; Ciuti G,Cancers,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32998213/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Therefore, there is a critical need to identify underlying metabolic factors associated with obesity that could be contributing toward increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in this vulnerable population. Here, we focus on the critical role of potent endogenous lipid metabolites known as specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) that are synthesized from polyunsaturated fatty acids. SPMs are generated during the transition of inflammation to resolution and have a vital role in directing damaged tissues to homeostasis; furthermore, SPMs display anti-viral activity in the context of influenza infection without being immunosuppressive. We cover evidence from rodent and human studies to show that obesity, and its co-morbidities, induce a signature of SPM deficiency across immunometabolic tissues. We further discuss how the effects of obesity upon SARS-CoV-2 infection are likely exacerbated with environmental exposures that promote chronic pulmonary inflammation and augment SPM deficits. Finally, we highlight potential approaches to overcome the loss of SPMs using dietary and pharmacological interventions. Collectively, this mini-review underscores the need for mechanistic studies on how SPM deficiencies driven by obesity and environmental exposures may exacerbate the response to SARS-CoV-2.",Pal A; Gowdy KM; Oestreich KJ; Beck M; Shaikh SR,Frontiers in immunology,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32983141/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32938742,Plasma Membrane MCC/Eisosome Domains Promote Stress Resistance in Fungi.,"There is growing appreciation that the plasma membrane orchestrates a diverse array of functions by segregating different activities into specialized domains that vary in size, stability, and composition. Studies with the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> have identified a novel type of plasma membrane domain known as the MCC (membrane compartment of Can1)/eisosomes that correspond to stable furrows in the plasma membrane. MCC/eisosomes maintain proteins at the cell surface, such as nutrient transporters like the Can1 arginine symporter, by protecting them from endocytosis and degradation. Recent studies from several fungal species are now revealing new functional roles for MCC/eisosomes that enable cells to respond to a wide range of stressors, including changes in membrane tension, nutrition, cell wall integrity, oxidation, and copper toxicity. The different MCC/eisosome functions are often intertwined through the roles of these domains in lipid homeostasis, which is important for proper plasma membrane architecture and cell signaling. Therefore, this review will emphasize the emerging models that explain how MCC/eisosomes act as hubs to coordinate cellular responses to stress. The importance of MCC/eisosomes is underscored by their roles in virulence for fungal pathogens of plants, animals, and humans, which also highlights the potential of these domains to act as novel therapeutic targets.",Lanze CE; Gandra RM; Foderaro JE; Swenson KA; Douglas LM; Konopka JB,Microbiology and molecular biology reviews : MMBR,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32938742/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Studies conducted so far with various bacterial infection models demonstrate the release of various types of EVs that include exosomes and microvesicles. Depending upon the infection and cell type, EV cargo composition changes and ultimately might impact the host immune response and bacterial growth. The mechanisms behind the EVs release, cargo composition, and impact on the immune system have not been fully investigated. Future research needs to include in vivo models to understand the relevance of EVs in host immune function during bacterial infection, and to determine aspects that are shared or species-specific in the host.

32882437,New technologies and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis - Which step forward rushed by the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fast-progressive neurodegenerative disease leading to progressive physical immobility with usually normal or mild cognitive and/or behavioural involvement. Many patients are relatively young, instructed, sensitive to new technologies, and professionally active when developing the first symptoms. Older patients usually require more time, encouragement, reinforcement and a closer support but, nevertheless, selecting user-friendly devices, provided earlier in the course of the disease, and engaging motivated carers may overcome many technological barriers. ALS may be considered a model for neurodegenerative diseases to further develop and test new technologies. From multidisciplinary teleconsults to telemonitoring of the respiratory function, telemedicine has the potentiality to embrace other fields, including nutrition, physical mobility, and the interaction with the environment. Brain-computer interfaces and eye tracking expanded the field of augmentative and alternative communication in ALS but their potentialities go beyond communication, to cognition and robotics. Virtual reality and different forms of artificial intelligence present further interesting possibilities that deserve to be investigated. COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented opportunity to speed up the development and implementation of new technologies in clinical practice, improving the daily living of both ALS patients and carers.

32849445,Circular RNAs: New Epigenetic Signatures in Viral Infections.,"Covalent closed circular RNAs (circRNAs) can act as a bridge between non-coding RNAs and coding messenger RNAs. CircRNAs are generated by a back-splicing mechanism during post-transcriptional processing and are abundantly expressed in eukaryotic cells. CircRNAs can act via the modulation of RNA transcription and protein production, and by the sponging of microRNAs (miRNAs). CircRNAs are now thought to be involved in many different biological and pathological processes. Some studies have suggested that the expression of host circRNAs is dysregulated in several types of virus-infected cells, compared to control cells. It is highly likely that viruses can use these molecules for their own purposes. In addition, some viral genes are able to produce viral circRNAs (VcircRNA) by a back-splicing mechanism. However, the viral genes that encode VcircRNAs, and their functions, are poorly studied. In this review, we highlight some new findings about the interaction of host circRNAs and viral infection. Moreover, the potential of VcircRNAs derived from the virus itself, to act as biomarkers and therapeutic targets is summarized.",Nahand JS; Jamshidi S; Hamblin MR; Mahjoubin-Tehran M; Vosough M; Jamali M; Khatami A; Moghoofei M; Baghi HB; Mirzaei H,Frontiers in microbiology,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32849445/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32846882,Dietary Fibre Consensus from the International Carbohydrate Quality Consortium (ICQC).,"Dietary fibre is a generic term describing non-absorbed plant carbohydrates and small amounts of associated non-carbohydrate components. The main contributors of fibre to the diet are the cell walls of plant tissues, which are supramolecular polymer networks containing variable proportions of cellulose, hemicelluloses, pectic substances, and non-carbohydrate components, such as lignin. Other contributors of fibre are the intracellular storage oligosaccharides, such as fructans. A distinction needs to be made between intrinsic sources of dietary fibre and purified forms of fibre, given that the three-dimensional matrix of the plant cell wall confers benefits beyond fibre isolates. Movement through the digestive tract modifies the cell wall structure and may affect the interactions with the colonic microbes (e.g., small intestinally non-absorbed carbohydrates are broken down by bacteria to short-chain fatty acids, absorbed by colonocytes). These aspects, combined with the fibre associated components (e.g., micronutrients, polyphenols, phytosterols, and phytoestrogens), may contribute to the health outcomes seen with the consumption of dietary fibre. Therefore, where possible, processing should minimise the degradation of the plant cell wall structures to preserve some of its benefits. Food labelling should include dietary fibre values and distinguish between intrinsic and added fibre. Labelling may also help achieve the recommended intake of 14 g/1000 kcal/day.",Augustin LSA; Aas AM; Astrup A; Atkinson FS; Baer-Sinnott S; Barclay AW; Brand-Miller JC; Brighenti F; Bullo M; Buyken AE; Ceriello A; Ellis PR; Ha MA; Henry JC; Kendall CWC; La Vecchia C; Liu S; Livesey G; Poli A; Salas-Salvadó J; Riccardi G; Riserus U; Rizkalla SW; Sievenpiper JL; Trichopoulou A; Usic K; Wolever TMS; Willett WC; Jenkins DJA,Nutrients,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32846882/,0,0,0,0,0,0
32823942,Clonal Hematopoiesis in Liquid Biopsy: From Biological Noise to Valuable Clinical Implications.,"The use of blood liquid biopsy is being gradually incorporated into the clinical setting of cancer management. The minimally invasive nature of the usage of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and its ability to capture the molecular alterations of tumors are great advantages for their clinical applications. However, somatic mosaicism in plasma remains an immense challenge for accurate interpretation of liquid biopsy results. Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is part of the normal process of aging with the accumulation of somatic mutations and clonal expansion of hematopoietic stem cells. The detection of these non-tumor derived CH-mutations has been repeatedly reported as a source of biological background noise of blood liquid biopsy. Incorrect classification of CH mutations as tumor-derived mutations could lead to inappropriate therapeutic management. CH has also been associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease and hematological malignancies. Cancer patients, who are CH carriers, are more prone to develop therapy-related myeloid neoplasms after chemotherapy than non-carriers. The detection of CH mutations from plasma cfDNA analysis should be cautiously evaluated for their potential pathological relevance. Although CH mutations are currently considered as ""false-positives"" in cfDNA analysis, future studies should evaluate their clinical significance in healthy individuals and cancer patients.",Chan HT; Chin YM; Nakamura Y; Low SK,Cancers,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32823942/,1,0,0,0,0,0

32776793,Is there evidence for bacterial transfer via the placenta and any role in the colonization of the infant gut? - a systematic review.,"With the important role of the gut microbiome in health and disease, it is crucial to understand key factors that establish the microbial community, including gut colonization during infancy. It has been suggested that the first bacterial exposure is via a placental microbiome. However, despite many publications, the robustness of the evidence for the placental microbiome and transfer of bacteria from the placenta to the infant gut is unclear and hence the concept disputed. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of the evidence for the role of the placental, amniotic fluid and cord blood microbiome in healthy mothers in the colonization of the infant gut. Most of the papers which were fully assessed considered placental tissue, but some studied amniotic fluid or cord blood. Great variability in methodology was observed especially regarding sample storage conditions, DNA/RNA extraction, and microbiome characterization. No study clearly considered transfer of the normal placental microbiome to the infant gut.

32746854,Role of exosomes in malignant glioma: microRNAs and proteins in pathogenesis and diagnosis.,"Malignant gliomas are the most common and deadly type of central nervous system tumors. Despite some advances in treatment, the mean survival time remains only about 1.25 years. Even after surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, gliomas still have a poor prognosis. Exosomes are the most common type of extracellular vesicles with a size range of 30 to 100 nm, and can act as carriers of proteins, RNAs, and other bioactive molecules. Exosomes play a key role in tumorigenesis and resistance to chemotherapy or radiation. Recent evidence has shown that exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) can be detected in the extracellular microenvironment, and can also be transferred from cell to cell via exosome secretion and uptake. Therefore, many recent studies have focused on exosomal miRNAs as important cellular regulators in various physiological and pathological conditions. A variety of exosomal miRNAs have been implicated in the initiation and progression of gliomas, by activating and/or inhibiting different signaling pathways. Exosomal miRNAs could be used as therapeutic agents to modulate different biological processes in gliomas. Exosomal miRNAs derived from mesenchymal stem cells could also be used for glioma treatment. The present review summarizes the exosomal miRNAs that have been implicated in the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of gliomas. Moreover, exosomal proteins could also be involved in glioma pathogenesis. Exosomal miRNAs and proteins could also serve as non-invasive biomarkers for prognosis and disease monitoring.

32728750,"Definitions, regulations, and new frontiers for dietary fiber and whole grains.","The aim of this article is to review the definitions and regulations for dietary fiber and whole grains worldwide and to discuss barriers to meeting recommended intake levels. Plant foods, such as whole grains, that are rich in dietary fiber are universally recommended in dietary guidance. Foods rich in dietary fiber are recommended for all, but dietary recommendations for whole grains and dietary fiber depend on definitions and regulations. Official recommendations for dietary fiber in the United States and Canada are denoted by dietary reference intakes (DRIs), which are developed by the Institute of Medicine. An adequate intake (AI) for dietary fiber was based on prospective cohort studies of dietary fiber intake and cardiovascular disease risk that found 14 grams of dietary fiber per 1000 kilocalories protected against cardiovascular disease (CVD). This value was used to set AIs for dietary fiber across the life cycle based on recommended calorie intakes. Actual intakes of dietary fiber are generally about half of the recommended levels. Recommendations for whole grain intake are equally challenging, as definitions for whole grain foods are needed to set recommendations. The 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommended that half of all grain servings be whole grains, but usual intakes are generally less than 1 serving per day, rather than the recommended 3 servings per day. Scientific support for whole grain recommendations is based on the same prospective cohort studies and links to CVD protection used to inform dietary fiber guidance. Thus, dietary fiber is a recommended nutrient and whole grains are a recommended dietary pattern in dietary guidance in North America and around the world. Challenges for attaining recommended intakes of dietary fiber and whole grains include low-carbohydrate diets, low-gluten diets, and public health recommendations to avoid processed foods.",Korczak R; Slavin JL,Nutrition reviews,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32728750/,1,0,0,0,0,1
32665978,Artificial intelligence to improve back pain outcomes and lessons learnt from clinical classification approaches: three systematic reviews.,"Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) could enhance the ability to detect patterns of clinical characteristics in low-back pain (LBP) and guide treatment. We conducted three systematic reviews to address the following aims: (a) review the status of AI/ML research in LBP, (b) compare its status to that of two established LBP classification systems (STarT Back, McKenzie). AI/ML in LBP is in its infancy: 45 of 48 studies assessed sample sizes <1000 people, 19 of 48 studies used ≤5 parameters in models, 13 of 48 studies applied multiple models and attained high accuracy, 25 of 48 studies assessed the binary classification of LBP versus no-LBP only. Beyond the 48 studies using AI/ML for LBP classification, no studies examined use of AI/ML in prognosis prediction of specific sub-groups, and AI/ML techniques are yet to be implemented in guiding LBP treatment. In contrast, the STarT Back tool has been assessed for internal consistency, test-retest reliability, validity, pain and disability prognosis, and influence on pain and disability treatment outcomes. McKenzie has been assessed for inter- and intra-tester reliability, prognosis, and impact on pain and disability outcomes relative to other treatments. For AI/ML methods to contribute to the refinement of LBP (sub-)classification and guide treatment allocation, large data sets containing known and exploratory clinical features should be examined. There is also a need to establish reliability, validity, and prognostic capacity of AI/ML techniques in LBP as well as its ability to inform treatment allocation for improved patient outcomes and/or reduced healthcare costs.",Tagliaferri SD; Angelova M; Zhao X; Owen PJ; Miller CT; Wilkin T; Belavy DL,NPJ digital medicine,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32665978/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32661122,The Great ESKAPE: Exploring the Crossroads of Bile and Antibiotic Resistance in Bacterial Pathogens.,"Throughout the course of infection, many pathogens encounter bactericidal conditions that threaten the viability of the bacteria and impede the establishment of infection. Bile is one of the most innately bactericidal compounds present in humans, functioning to reduce the bacterial burden in the gastrointestinal tract while also aiding in digestion. It is becoming increasingly apparent that pathogens successfully resist the bactericidal conditions of bile, including bacteria that do not normally cause gastrointestinal infections. This review highlights the ability of <i>Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Klebsiella</i>, <i>Acinetobacter</i>, <i>Pseudomonas</i>, <i>Enterobacter</i> (ESKAPE), and other enteric pathogens to resist bile and how these interactions can impact the sensitivity of bacteria to various antimicrobial agents. Given that pathogen exposure to bile is an essential component to gastrointestinal transit that cannot be avoided, understanding how bile resistance mechanisms align with antimicrobial resistance is vital to our ability to develop new, successful therapeutics in an age of widespread and increasing antimicrobial resistance.",Gipson KS; Nickerson KP; Drenkard E; Llanos-Chea A; Dogiparthi SK; Lanter BB; Hibbler RM; Yonker LM; Hurley BP; Faherty CS,Infection and immunity,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32661122/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32652128,The protein and microRNA cargo of extracellular vesicles from parasitic helminths - current status and research priorities.,"Helminth parasites have a remarkable ability to persist within their mammalian hosts, which is largely due to their secretion of molecules with immunomodulatory properties. Although the soluble components of helminth secretions have been extensively studied, the discovery that helminths release extracellular vesicles (EVs) has added further complexity to the host-parasite interaction. Whilst several studies have begun to characterise the molecules carried by helminth EVs, work aimed at investigating their biological functions has been hindered by a lack of helminth-specific EV markers. To begin to address this, we summarised helminth EV literature to date. With a focus on the protein and microRNA (miRNA) cargo, we aimed to detect similarities and differences across those major groups of helminths for which data are available; namely nematodes, trematodes and cestodes. Pfam analysis revealed that although there is no universal EV marker for all helminth species, the EF-hand protein family was present in all EV datasets from cestodes and trematodes, and could serve as a platyhelminth EV biomarker. In contrast, M13 metallopeptidases and actin may have potential as markers for nematode EVs. As with proteins, many miRNA families appeared to be species-, stage-, or dataset-specific. Two miRNA families were common to nematode EVs (mir-10 and let-7); the miRNA cargo of EVs secreted by clade I species appeared somewhat different from species from other clades. Five miRNA families (mir-71, mir-10, mir-190, let-7 and mir-2) were shared by all trematode species examined. Our analysis has identified novel markers that may be used in studies aimed at characterising helminth EVs and interrogating their function at the host-parasite interface. In addition, we discuss the heterogeneity of methods used for helminth EV isolation and emphasise the need for a standardised approach in reporting on helminth EV data.",Sotillo J; Robinson MW; Kimber MJ; Cucher M; Ancarola ME; Nejsum P; Marcilla A; Eichenberger RM; Tritten L,International journal for parasitology,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32652128/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32641760,Conversion of extracellular ATP into adenosine: a master switch in renal health and disease.,"ATP and its ultimate degradation product adenosine are potent extracellular signalling molecules that elicit a variety of pathophysiological functions in the kidney through the activation of P2 and P1 purinergic receptors, respectively. Extracellular purines can modulate immune responses, balancing inflammatory processes and immunosuppression; indeed, alterations in extracellular nucleotide and adenosine signalling determine outcomes of inflammation and healing processes. The functional activities of ectonucleotidases such as CD39 and CD73, which hydrolyse pro-inflammatory ATP to generate immunosuppressive adenosine, are therefore pivotal in acute inflammation. Protracted inflammation may result in aberrant adenosinergic signalling, which serves to sustain inflammasome activation and worsen fibrotic reactions. Alterations in the expression of ectonucleotidases on various immune cells, such as regulatory T cells and macrophages, as well as components of the renal vasculature, control purinergic receptor-mediated effects on target tissues within the kidney. The role of CD39 as a rheostat that can have an impact on purinergic signalling in both acute and chronic inflammation is increasingly supported by the literature, as detailed in this Review. Better understanding of these purinergic processes and development of novel drugs targeting these pathways could lead to effective therapies for the management of acute and chronic kidney disease.",Dwyer KM; Kishore BK; Robson SC,Nature reviews.

32640513,Precision and Personalized Medicine: How Genomic Approach Improves the Management of Cardiovascular and Neurodegenerative Disease.,"Life expectancy has gradually grown over the last century. This has deeply affected healthcare costs, since the growth of an aging population is correlated to the increasing burden of chronic diseases. This represents the interesting challenge of how to manage patients with chronic diseases in order to improve health care budgets. Effective primary prevention could represent a promising route. To this end, precision, together with personalized medicine, are useful instruments in order to investigate pathological processes before the appearance of clinical symptoms and to guide physicians to choose a targeted therapy to manage the patient. Cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases represent suitable models for taking full advantage of precision medicine technologies applied to all stages of disease development. The availability of high technology incorporating artificial intelligence and advancement progress made in the field of biomedical research have been substantial to understand how genes, epigenetic modifications, aging, nutrition, drugs, microbiome and other environmental factors can impact health and chronic disorders. The aim of the present review is to address how precision and personalized medicine can bring greater clarity to the clinical and biological complexity of these types of disorders associated with high mortality, involving tremendous health care costs, by describing in detail the methods that can be applied. This might offer precious tools for preventive strategies and possible clues on the evolution of the disease and could help in predicting morbidity, mortality and detecting chronic disease indicators much earlier in the disease course. This, of course, will have a major effect on both improving the quality of care and quality of life of the patients and reducing time efforts and healthcare costs.",Strianese O; Rizzo F; Ciccarelli M; Galasso G; D'Agostino Y; Salvati A; Del Giudice C; Tesorio P; Rusciano MR,Genes,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32640513/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32632658,Hydration for health hypothesis: a narrative review of supporting evidence.,"An increasing body of evidence suggests that excreting a generous volume of diluted urine is associated with short- and long-term beneficial health effects, especially for kidney and metabolic function. However, water intake and hydration remain under-investigated and optimal hydration is poorly and inconsistently defined. This review tests the hypothesis that optimal chronic water intake positively impacts various aspects of health and proposes an evidence-based definition of optimal hydration. Search strategy included PubMed and Google Scholar using relevant keywords for each health outcome, complemented by manual search of article reference lists and the expertise of relevant practitioners for each area studied. The available literature suggest the effects of increased water intake on health may be direct, due to increased urine flow or urine dilution, or indirect, mediated by a reduction in osmotically -stimulated vasopressin (AVP). Urine flow affects the formation of kidney stones and recurrence of urinary tract infection, while increased circulating AVP is implicated in metabolic disease, chronic kidney disease, and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. In order to ensure optimal hydration, it is proposed that optimal total water intake should approach 2.5 to 3.5 L day<sup>-1</sup> to allow for the daily excretion of 2 to 3 L of dilute (< 500 mOsm kg<sup>-1</sup>) urine. Simple urinary markers of hydration such as urine color or void frequency may be used to monitor and adjust intake.",Perrier ET; Armstrong LE; Bottin JH; Clark WF; Dolci A; Guelinckx I; Iroz A; Kavouras SA; Lang F; Lieberman HR; Melander O; Morin C; Seksek I; Stookey JD; Tack I; Vanhaecke T; Vecchio M; Péronnet F,European journal of nutrition,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32632658/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32596250,A Guide to Diet-Microbiome Study Design.,"Intense recent interest in understanding how the human gut microbiome influences health has kindled a concomitant interest in linking dietary choices to microbiome variation. Diet is known to be a driver of microbiome variation, and yet the precise mechanisms by which certain dietary components modulate the microbiome, and by which the microbiome produces byproducts and secondary metabolites from dietary components, are not well-understood. Interestingly, despite the influence of diet on the gut microbiome, the majority of microbiome studies published to date contain little or no analysis of dietary intake. Although an increasing number of microbiome studies are now collecting some form of dietary data or even performing diet interventions, there are no clear standards in the microbiome field for how to collect diet data or how to design a diet-microbiome study. In this article, we review the current practices in diet-microbiome analysis and study design and make several recommendations for best practices to provoke broader discussion in the field. We recommend that microbiome studies include multiple consecutive microbiome samples per study timepoint or phase and multiple days of dietary history prior to each microbiome sample whenever feasible. We find evidence that direct effects of diet on the microbiome are likely to be observable within days, while the length of an intervention required for observing microbiome-mediated effects on the host phenotype or host biomarkers, depending on the outcome, may be much longer, on the order of weeks or months. Finally, recent studies demonstrating that diet-microbiome interactions are personalized suggest that diet-microbiome studies should either include longitudinal sampling within individuals to identify personalized responses, or should include an adequate number of participants spanning a range of microbiome types to identify generalized responses.",Johnson AJ; Zheng JJ; Kang JW; Saboe A; Knights D; Zivkovic AM,Frontiers in nutrition,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32596250/,1,0,0,0,0,1

32546049,Carotid Intima-Media Thickness Progression as Surrogate Marker for Cardiovascular Risk: Meta-Analysis of 119 Clinical Trials Involving 100 667 Patients.,"To quantify the association between effects of interventions on carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) progression and their effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. We systematically collated data from randomized, controlled trials. cIMT was assessed as the mean value at the common-carotid-artery; if unavailable, the maximum value at the common-carotid-artery or other cIMT measures were used. The primary outcome was a combined CVD end point defined as myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization procedures, or fatal CVD. We estimated intervention effects on cIMT progression and incident CVD for each trial, before relating the 2 using a Bayesian meta-regression approach. We analyzed data of 119 randomized, controlled trials involving 100 667 patients (mean age 62 years, 42% female). Over an average follow-up of 3.7 years, 12 038 patients developed the combined CVD end point. Across all interventions, each 10 μm/y reduction of cIMT progression resulted in a relative risk for CVD of 0.91 (95% Credible Interval, 0.87-0.94), with an additional relative risk for CVD of 0.92 (0.87-0.97) being achieved independent of cIMT progression. Taken together, we estimated that interventions reducing cIMT progression by 10, 20, 30, or 40 μm/y would yield relative risks of 0.84 (0.75-0.93), 0.76 (0.67-0.85), 0.69 (0.59-0.79), or 0.63 (0.52-0.74), respectively. Results were similar when grouping trials by type of intervention, time of conduct, time to ultrasound follow-up, availability of individual-participant data, primary versus secondary prevention trials, type of cIMT measurement, and proportion of female patients. The extent of intervention effects on cIMT progression predicted the degree of CVD risk reduction.

32527267,"Multisector nutrition gains amidst evidence scarcity: scoping review of policies, data and interventions to reduce child stunting in Afghanistan.","Child health indicators have substantially improved across the last decade, yet Afghanistan has among the highest child stunting and malnutrition rates in Asia. Multisectoral approaches were recently introduced but evidence for this approach to improve support for and implementation of child nutrition programmes is limited compared to other countries. We reviewed policy and programme data to identify best practices and gaps surrounding child malnutrition in Afghanistan. We conducted a scoping review using broad search categories and approaches, including database and website searches, reference hand-searches, purposive policy and programme document request, and key informant interviews. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were developed iteratively, with abstracts and documents assessed against the final criteria. We abstracted documents systematically and summarised and synthesised content to generate the main findings. We included 18 policies and strategies, 45 data sources and reports, and 20 intervention evaluations. Movement towards multisectoral efforts to address malnutrition at the policy level has started; however, integrated nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions are not yet uniformly delivered at the community level. Many data sources capturing nutrition, food security and WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) indicators are available but indicator definitions are not standardised and there are few longitudinal nutrition surveys. Political will to improve household nutrition status has shown increased government and donor investments in nutrition-sensitive and nutrition-specific programmes through combined small- and large-scale interventions between 2004 and 2013; however, evidence for interventions that effectively decrease stunting prevalence is limited. This review shows a breadth of nutrition programme, policy and data in Afghanistan. Multisector approaches faced challenges of reaching sufficient coverage as they often included a package of food security, livelihoods and health interventions but were each implemented independently.

A range of molecular components and cellular pathways, have been implicated in its pathogenesis. In this review, we focus on the TGF-β and WNT signaling pathways, and their mutual interaction, which have emerged as important factors involved in cardiac pathophysiology. The molecular and cellular processes involved in the initiation and progression of cardiac fibrosis are summarized. We focus on TGF-β and WNT signaling in cardiac fibrosis, ECM production, and myofibroblast transformation. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are one of the main players in the regulation of multiple pathways and cellular processes. MicroRNAs, long non-coding RNAs, and circular long non-coding RNAs can all interact with the TGF-β/WNT signaling axis to affect cardiac fibrosis. A better understanding of these processes may lead to new approaches for diagnosis and treatment of many cardiac conditions.

32517694,Autophagy in cancers including brain tumors: role of MicroRNAs.,"Autophagy has a crucial role in many cancers, including brain tumors. Several types of endogenous molecules (e.g. microRNAs, AKT, PTEN, p53, EGFR, and NF1) can modulate the process of autophagy. Recently miRNAs (small non-coding RNAs) have been found to play a vital role in the regulation of different cellular and molecular processes, such as autophagy. Deregulation of these molecules is associated with the development and progression of different pathological conditions, including brain tumors. It was found that miRNAs are epigenetic regulators, which influence the level of proteins coded by the targeted mRNAs with any modification of the genetic sequences. It has been revealed that various miRNAs (e.g., miR-7-1-3p, miR-340, miR-17, miR-30a, miR-224-3p, and miR-93), as epigenetic regulators, can modulate autophagy pathways within brain tumors. A deeper understanding of the underlying molecular targets of miRNAs, and their function in autophagy pathways could contribute to the development of new treatment methods for patients with brain tumors. In this review, we summarize the various miRNAs, which are involved in regulating autophagy in brain tumors. Moreover, we highlight the role of miRNAs in autophagy-related pathways in different cancers.

Innovative solutions are needed: artificial intelligence (AI) and physical robotics will drastically contribute for the future of the healthcare services. The translation of robotic technologies from traditional surgery to minimally invasive endoscopic interventions is an emerging field, mainly challenged by the tough requirements for miniaturization. Pioneering approaches for robotic colonoscopy have been reported in the nineties, with the appearance of inchworm-like devices. Since then, robotic colonoscopes with assistive functionalities have become commercially available. Research prototypes promise enhanced accessibility and flexibility for future therapeutic interventions, even via autonomous or robotic-assisted agents, such as robotic capsules. Furthermore, the pairing of such endoscopic systems with AI-enabled image analysis and recognition methods promises enhanced diagnostic yield.

This overview summarises the main themes discussed during the 3<sup>rd</sup> Symposium on ""Nutrition for the Ageing Brain: Moving Towards Clinical Applications"" held in Madrid in August 2018, enlarged with the current state of knowledge on how nutrition influences healthy ageing and gives recommendations regarding how the critical field of nutrition and neurodegeneration research should move forward into the future. Specific nutrients are discussed as well as the impact of multi-nutrient and whole diet approaches, showing particular promise to combatting the growing burden of age-related cognitive decline. The emergence of new avenues for exploring the role of diet in healthy ageing, such as the impact of the gut microbiome and development of new techniques (imaging measures of brain metabolism, metabolomics, biomarkers) are enabling researchers to approach finding answers to these questions. But the translation of these findings into clinical and public health contexts remains an obstacle due to significant shortcomings in nutrition research or pressure on the scientific community to communicate recommendations to the general public in a convincing and accessible way. Some promising programs exist but further investigation to improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which nutrition can improve brain health across the human lifespan is still required.",Flanagan E; Lamport D; Brennan L; Burnet P; Calabrese V; Cunnane SC; de Wilde MC; Dye L; Farrimond JA; Emerson Lombardo N; Hartmann T; Hartung T; Kalliomäki M; Kuhnle GG; La Fata G; Sala-Vila A; Samieri C; Smith AD; Spencer JPE; Thuret S; Tuohy K; Turroni S; Vanden Berghe W; Verkuijl M; Verzijden K; Yannakoulia M; Geurts L; Vauzour D,Ageing research reviews,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32461136/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32449931,Potential Markers of Dietary Glycemic Exposures for Sustained Dietary Interventions in Populations without Diabetes.,"There is considerable interest in dietary and other approaches to maintaining blood glucose concentrations within the normal range and minimizing exposure to postprandial hyperglycemic excursions. The accepted marker to evaluate the sustained maintenance of normal blood glucose concentrations is glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). However, although this is used in clinical practice to monitor glycemic control in patients with diabetes, it has a number of drawbacks as a marker of efficacy of dietary interventions that might beneficially affect glycemic control in people without diabetes. Other markers that reflect shorter-term glycemic exposures have been studied and proposed, but consensus on the use and relevance of these markers is lacking. We have carried out a systematic search for studies that have tested the responsiveness of 6 possible alternatives to HbA1c as markers of sustained variation in glycemic exposures and thus their potential applicability for use in dietary intervention trials in subjects without diabetes: 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG), dicarbonyl stress, fructosamine, glycated albumin (GA), advanced glycated end products (AGEs), and metabolomic profiles. The results suggest that GA may be the most promising for this purpose, but values may be confounded by effects of fat mass. 1,5-AG and fructosamine are probably not sensitive enough to the range of variation in glycemic exposures observed in healthy individuals. Use of measures based on dicarbonyls, AGEs, or metabolomic profiles would require further research into possible specific molecular species of interest. At present, none of the markers considered here is sufficiently validated and sensitive for routine use in substantiating the effects of sustained variation in dietary glycemic exposures in people without diabetes.",Feskens E; Brennan L; Dussort P; Flourakis M; Lindner LME; Mela D; Rabbani N; Rathmann W; Respondek F; Stehouwer C; Theis S; Thornalley P; Vinoy S,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32449931/,0,1,0,0,0,0

32428668,"What's new in IBD therapy: An ""omics network"" approach.","The industrial revolution that began in the late 1800s has resulted in dramatic changes in the environment, human lifestyle, dietary habits, social structure, and so on. Almost certainly because this rapid evolution has outpaced the ability of the body to adapt to a number of environmental and behavioral changes, there has been a parallel emergence of several chronic inflammatory diseases, among which are inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), primarily ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The ability to treat these conditions has progressively improved in the last 50 years, particularly in the last couple of decades with the introduction of biological therapy targeting primarily soluble mediators produced by inflammatory cells. A large number of biologics are now available, but all of them induce similarly unsatisfactory (<50%) rates of clinical response and remission, and most of them lose efficacy over time, requiring dose escalation or switching from one biologic to another. So, treatment of IBD still needs improvement that will occur only if different approaches are taken. A reason why even the most recent forms of IBD therapy are unsatisfactory is because they target only selected components of an exceedingly complex pathophysiological process, a reality that must be honestly considered if better IBD therapies are to be achieved. Brand new approaches must integrate all relevant factors in their totality - the ""omes"" - and identify the key controllers of biological responses. This can be accomplished by using systems biology-based approaches and advanced bioinformatics tools, which together represent the essence of network medicine. This review looks at the past and the present of IBD pathogenesis and therapy, and discusses how to develop new therapies based on a network medicine approach.",Fiocchi C; Iliopoulos D,Pharmacological research,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32428668/,1,0,0,0,0,0

32414352,Socio-demographic characteristics and risk factors for HIV transmission in female bar workers in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic literature review.,"Although sex workers are considered a key population in the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), less consideration has been given to female bar workers (FBW), whose primary occupation is not sex work but who often engage in transactional sex. Understanding FBWs' risk profiles is central to designing targeted HIV prevention interventions for them. This systematic review describes the socio-demographic characteristics and risk factors for HIV transmission among FBWs in SSA. We searched six databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Popline, Embase and additionally the World Health Organization's WHOLIS database for grey literature between July and September 2017. Inclusion criteria were reporting (1) primary socio-demographic or behavioral data; on (2) women who sold or delivered drinks to clients; (3) in establishments serving alcohol; (4) in SSA. We excluded studies not presenting separate data on FBWs. We extracted quantitative and qualitative data from the selected studies and conducted a qualitative synthesis of findings. We found 4565 potentially eligible articles, including duplicates. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, we retained 19 articles. FBWs often migrated from rural to urban areas due to economic need or social marginalization. They began bar-based transactional sex due to low wages, peer pressure and to increase financial independence. FBWs had high HIV risk awareness but low agency to negotiate condom use, particularly with regular partners or when offered higher prices for condomless sex. FBWs were also vulnerable to violence and stigmatization. FBWs are a vulnerable population for HIV infection. Despite social stigmatization and elevated risk of contracting STIs, bar work remains attractive because it enables unskilled women to both, make a living and maintain some independence. FBWs face HIV-related risk factors at the individual, community and societal level and may benefit from biomedical, behavioral and structural interventions.",Dambach P; Mahenge B; Mashasi I; Muya A; Barnhart DA; Bärnighausen TW; Spiegelman D; Harling G,BMC public health,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32414352/,0,1,0,0,0,0

Novel e-Health technologies have been developed in order to provide a comprehensive and personalized plan of action for the prevention and management of overweight and obesity in childhood and adolescence. We used information and communication technologies to develop a ""National Registry for the Prevention and Management of Overweight and Obesity"" in order to register online children and adolescents nationwide, and to guide pediatricians and general practitioners regarding the management of overweight or obese subjects. Furthermore, intelligent multi-level information systems and specialized artificial intelligence algorithms are being developed with a view to offering precision and personalized medical management to obese or overweight subjects. Moreover, the Big Data against Childhood Obesity platform records behavioral data objectively by using inertial sensors and Global Positioning System (GPS) and combines them with data of the environment, in order to assess the full contextual framework that is associated with increased body mass index (BMI). Finally, a computerized decision-support tool was developed to assist pediatric health care professionals in delivering personalized nutrition and lifestyle optimization advice to overweight or obese children and their families.

32383066,Systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between dairy consumption and the risk of hip fracture: critical interpretation of the currently available evidence.,"In the present meta-analysis, reductions in the risk of hip fracture with milk consumption were only observed among American adults, but not among Scandinavian adults, possibly because milk products are more commonly fortified with vitamin D in the former population than in Scandinavian countries. The reduction in the risk of hip fracture was also observed with yogurt consumption, which is often associated with healthy lifestyles and dietary patterns that contribute to improved bone health. Although dairy products contain bone-beneficial nutrients, the association between dairy consumption and the risk of hip fracture remains equivocal. Fueling this uncertainty, the elevated risk of hip fracture in association with milk consumption was observed in a cohort of Swedish women. A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies was performed to critically evaluate the association, or lack thereof, between dairy consumption (milk, yogurt, and cheese) and the risk of hip fracture. A random effects model was used to generate the summary relative risks (RRs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations of interest. In the meta-analysis of the highest versus lowest category of consumption, higher consumption of yogurt (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68, 0.90), but not milk (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.73, 1.02) or cheese (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.66, 1.08), was associated with a lower risk of hip fracture. For milk, the reduced risk of fracture with higher milk consumption was observed in the USA (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65, 0.87), but not in Scandinavian countries (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85, 1.17). These findings were further supported by the fact that American studies (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88, 0.98; per 1 glass/day), but not Scandinavian studies (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.95, 1.07; per 1 glass/day), demonstrated a linear association between milk consumption and the risk of hip fracture. The cumulative evidence from prospective cohort studies reassuringly suggests that the risk of hip fracture may not be elevated among people who consume milk, yogurt, and cheese, and that a greater consumption of milk or yogurt may even be associated with a lower risk of hip fracture depending on the factors that may differ across the population of interest.",Hidayat K; Du X; Shi BM; Qin LQ,Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32383066/,0,1,0,1,0,1
32382957,"Toxicity of fluoride: critical evaluation of evidence for human developmental neurotoxicity in epidemiological studies, animal experiments and in vitro analyses.","Recently, epidemiological studies have suggested that fluoride is a human developmental neurotoxicant that reduces measures of intelligence in children, placing it into the same category as toxic metals (lead, methylmercury, arsenic) and polychlorinated biphenyls. If true, this assessment would be highly relevant considering the widespread fluoridation of drinking water and the worldwide use of fluoride in oral hygiene products such as toothpaste. To gain a deeper understanding of these assertions, we reviewed the levels of human exposure, as well as results from animal experiments, particularly focusing on developmental toxicity, and the molecular mechanisms by which fluoride can cause adverse effects. Moreover, in vitro studies investigating fluoride in neuronal cells and precursor/stem cells were analyzed, and 23 epidemiological studies published since 2012 were considered. The results show that the margin of exposure (MoE) between no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) in animal studies and the current adequate intake (AI) of fluoride (50 µg/kg b.w./day) in humans ranges between 50 and 210, depending on the specific animal experiment used as reference. Even for unusually high fluoride exposure levels, an MoE of at least ten was obtained. Furthermore, concentrations of fluoride in human plasma are much lower than fluoride concentrations, causing effects in cell cultures. In contrast, 21 of 23 recent epidemiological studies report an association between high fluoride exposure and reduced intelligence. The discrepancy between experimental and epidemiological evidence may be reconciled with deficiencies inherent in most of these epidemiological studies on a putative association between fluoride and intelligence, especially with respect to adequate consideration of potential confounding factors, e.g., socioeconomic status, residence, breast feeding, low birth weight, maternal intelligence, and exposure to other neurotoxic chemicals. In conclusion, based on the totality of currently available scientific evidence, the present review does not support the presumption that fluoride should be assessed as a human developmental neurotoxicant at the current exposure levels in Europe.",Guth S; Hüser S; Roth A; Degen G; Diel P; Edlund K; Eisenbrand G; Engel KH; Epe B; Grune T; Heinz V; Henle T; Humpf HU; Jäger H; Joost HG; Kulling SE; Lampen A; Mally A; Marchan R; Marko D; Mühle E; Nitsche MA; Röhrdanz E; Stadler R; van Thriel C; Vieths S; Vogel RF; Wascher E; Watzl C; Nöthlings U; Hengstler JG,Archives of toxicology,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32382957/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We established the COronavirus Pandemic Epidemiology (COPE) consortium to address this unprecedented crisis on behalf of the epidemiology research community. As a central component of this initiative, we have developed a COVID Symptom Study (previously known as the COVID Symptom Tracker) mobile application as a common data collection tool for epidemiologic cohort studies with active study participants. This mobile application collects information on risk factors, daily symptoms, and outcomes through a user-friendly interface that minimizes participant burden. Combined with our efforts within the general population, data collected from nearly 3 million participants in the United States and United Kingdom are being used to address critical needs in the emergency response, including identifying potential hot spots of disease and clinically actionable risk factors. The linkage of symptom data collected in the app with information and biospecimens already collected in epidemiology cohorts will position us to address key questions related to diet, lifestyle, environmental, and socioeconomic factors on susceptibility to COVID-19, clinical outcomes related to infection, and long-term physical, mental health, and financial sequalae.

32324504,Intracellular and Intercellular Aspects of Macrophage Immunometabolism in Atherosclerosis.,"Macrophage immunometabolism, the changes in intracellular metabolic pathways that alter the function of these highly plastic cells, has been the subject of intense interest in the past few years, in part because macrophage immunometabolism plays important roles in atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases. In this review article, part of the <i>Compendium on Atherosclerosis</i>, we introduce the concepts of (1) intracellular immunometabolism-the canonical pathways of intrinsic cell activation leading to changes in intracellular metabolism, which in turn alter cellular function; and (2) intercellular immunometabolism-conditions in which intermediates of cellular metabolism are transferred from one cell to another, thereby altering the function of the recipient cell. The recent discovery that the metabolite cargo of dead and dying cells ingested through efferocytosis by macrophages can alter metabolic pathways and downstream function of the efferocyte is markedly changing the way we think about macrophage immunometabolism. Metabolic transitions of macrophages contribute to their functions in all stages of atherosclerosis, from lesion initiation to formation of advanced lesions characterized by necrotic cores, to lesion regression following aggressive lipid lowering. This review article discusses recent advances in our understanding of these different aspects of macrophage immunometabolism in atherosclerosis. With the increasing understanding of the roles of macrophage immunometabolism in atherosclerosis, new exciting concepts and potential targets for intervention are emerging.",Tabas I; Bornfeldt KE,Circulation research,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32324504/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The purpose of the study was to quantify the relationship of acute glucose and insulin postprandial responses with longer-term effects on diabetes-related risk factors by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of dietary intervention studies. We systematically searched EMBASE and MEDLINE. Dietary intervention studies among any human population aiming to reduce postprandial glycemia, with actual measures of postprandial glucose (PPG) and/or insulin (PPI) as acute exposures (incremental area under the curve, iAUC) as well as markers of glucose metabolism (fasting glucose, HbA1c) and insulin sensitivity (fasting insulin, HOMA-IR) after at least 4 weeks of diet intervention as outcomes were included. Meta-analyses were performed for the effects on acute exposures and on diabetes-related risk factors. The relationship between changes in acute exposures and changes in risk factor outcomes was estimated by meta-regression analyses. Out of the 13,004 screened papers, 13 papers with 14 comparisons were included in the quantitative analysis. The dietary interventions acutely reduced mean PPG [mean difference (MD), - 0.27 mmol/l; 95% CI - 0.41 to - 0.14], but not mean PPI (MD - 7.47 pmol/l; 95% CI - 16.79 to 1.86). There were no significant overall effects on fasting glucose and insulin. HbA1c was reduced by - 0.20% (95% CI - 0.35 to - 0.05). Changes in acute PPG were significantly associated with changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) [per 10% change in PPG: β = 0.085 (95% CI 0.003, 0.167), k = 14], but not with fasting insulin [β = 1.20 (95% CI - 0.32, 2.71), k = 12]. Changes in acute PPI were not associated with changes in FPG [per 10% change in PPI: β = - 0.017 (95% CI - 0.056, 0.022), k = 11]. Only a limited number of postprandial glucose-lowering dietary intervention studies measured acute postprandial exposures to PPG/PPI during the interventions. In this small heterogeneous set of studies, an association was found between the magnitude of the acute postprandial responses and the change in fasting glucose, but no other outcomes.

To bridge the gap between classical two-dimensional culture systems, which often involve transformed cell lines that may not have all the physiologic properties of primary cells, and in vivo animal studies, researchers have developed the organoid model system. Organoids are complex three-dimensional structures that are generated in vitro from primary cells and can recapitulate key in vivo properties of an organ such as structural organization, multicellularity, and function. In this review, we discuss how organoids have been deployed in exploring <i>Salmonella</i> infection in mice and humans. In addition, we summarize the recent advancements that hold promise to elevate our understanding of the interactions and crosstalk between multiple cell types and the microbiota with <i>Salmonella</i>.

32228618,"Effects of body condition on the insulin resistance, lipid metabolism and oxidative stress of lactating dairy cows.","Overconditioned dairy cows are prone to greater insulin resistance in transition to successfully adapt to negative energy balance. The associations among body condition score (BCS), insulin resistance, lipid metabolism and oxidative stress in cows during late lactation with positive energy balance remain to be elucidated. The objectives of this study were to investigate insulin sensitivity and oxidative status in late lactating dairy cows with different BCS but similar milk production, parity and days in milk. Forty-two multiparous Holstein cows were fed the same diet under the same management and divided into three groups based on BCS: low BCS (LBCS; BCS ≤ 2.75; n = 12), medium BCS (MBCS; 3.0 ≤ BCS ≤ 3.5; n = 15) or high BCS (HBCS; BCS ≥ 3.75; n = 15). Blood samples used for analysis of biochemical and hematological parameters were collected from the coccygeal vein at the end of experiment. The concentrations of insulin and nonesterified fatty acid were higher and the revised quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (RQUICKI) was lower in HBCS cows than in LBCS and MBCS cows. These results suggest that insulin resistance exacerbates lipolysis in HBCS cows. Serum concentrations of very low-density lipoprotein, apolipoprotein A-I, and apolipoprotein B were lower in HBCS cows than in LBCS or MBCS cows. Although LBCS and MBCS cows had higher reactive oxygen species levels than did HBCS cows, the malondialdehyde concentration was not different among cows with different BCS. Ceruloplasmin activity was higher in MBCS and HBCS cows than in LBCS cows, but superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and paraoxonase activities were not different among cows with different BCS. Despite the higher percentage of granulocytes in MBCS cows than in HBCS cows, no differences were found in leukocyte counts, red blood cell profiles and platelet profiles among the cows in the three groups.

These properties have led to a rapidly increasing range of commercial applications; this, however, may come at a cost, if an association to long-term health and environmental risks is discovered or even just perceived. Many nanomaterials (NMs) have not yet had their potential adverse biological effects fully assessed, due to costs and time constraints associated with the experimental assessment, frequently involving animals. Here, the available NM libraries are analyzed for their suitability for integration with novel nanoinformatics approaches and for the development of NM specific Integrated Approaches to Testing and Assessment (IATA) for human and environmental risk assessment, all within the NanoSolveIT cloud-platform. These established and well-characterized NM libraries (e.g. NanoMILE, NanoSolutions, NANoREG, NanoFASE, caLIBRAte, NanoTEST and the Nanomaterial Registry (>2000 NMs)) contain physicochemical characterization data as well as data for several relevant biological endpoints, assessed in part using harmonized Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) methods and test guidelines. Integration of such extensive NM information sources with the latest nanoinformatics methods will allow NanoSolveIT to model the relationships between NM structure (morphology), properties and their adverse effects and to predict the effects of other NMs for which less data is available. The project specifically addresses the needs of regulatory agencies and industry to effectively and rapidly evaluate the exposure, NM hazard and risk from nanomaterials and nano-enabled products, enabling implementation of computational 'safe-by-design' approaches to facilitate NM commercialization.",Afantitis A; Melagraki G; Isigonis P; Tsoumanis A; Varsou DD; Valsami-Jones E; Papadiamantis A; Ellis LA; Sarimveis H; Doganis P; Karatzas P; Tsiros P; Liampa I; Lobaskin V; Greco D; Serra A; Kinaret PAS; Saarimäki LA; Grafström R; Kohonen P; Nymark P; Willighagen E; Puzyn T; Rybinska-Fryca A; Lyubartsev A; Alstrup Jensen K; Brandenburg JG; Lofts S; Svendsen C; Harrison S; Maier D; Tamm K; Jänes J; Sikk L; Dusinska M; Longhin E; Rundén-Pran E; Mariussen E; El Yamani N; Unger W; Radnik J; Tropsha A; Cohen Y; Leszczynski J; Ogilvie Hendren C; Wiesner M; Winkler D; Suzuki N; Yoon TH; Choi JS; Sanabria N; Gulumian M; Lynch I,Computational and structural biotechnology journal,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32226594/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32187517,Neuro-immune Interactions in the Tissues.,"The ability of the nervous system to sense environmental stimuli and to relay these signals to immune cells via neurotransmitters and neuropeptides is indispensable for effective immunity and tissue homeostasis. Depending on the tissue microenvironment and distinct drivers of a certain immune response, the same neuronal populations and neuro-mediators can exert opposing effects, promoting or inhibiting tissue immunity. Here, we review the current understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the complex interactions between the immune and the nervous systems in different tissues and contexts. We outline current gaps in knowledge and argue for the importance of considering infectious and inflammatory disease within a conceptual framework that integrates neuro-immune circuits both local and systemic, so as to better understand effective immunity to develop improved approaches to treat inflammation and disease.",Chu C; Artis D; Chiu IM,Immunity,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32187517/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32135127,Early detection of pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is most frequently detected at an advanced stage. Such late detection restricts treatment options and contributes to a dismal 5-year survival rate of 3-15%. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is relatively uncommon and screening of the asymptomatic adult population is not feasible or recommended with current modalities. However, screening of individuals in high-risk groups is recommended. Here, we review groups at high risk for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, including individuals with inherited predisposition and patients with pancreatic cystic lesions. We discuss studies aimed at finding ways of identifying pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in high-risk groups, such as among individuals with new-onset diabetes mellitus and people attending primary and secondary care practices with symptoms that suggest this cancer. We review early detection biomarkers, explore the potential of using social media for detection, appraise prediction models developed using electronic health records and research data, and examine the application of artificial intelligence to medical imaging for the purposes of early detection.",Pereira SP; Oldfield L; Ney A; Hart PA; Keane MG; Pandol SJ; Li D; Greenhalf W; Jeon CY; Koay EJ; Almario CV; Halloran C; Lennon AM; Costello E,The lancet.

To determine to what extent exosomes and exosomal miRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis, progression and diagnosis of viral infections. The scientific literature (PubMed and Google Scholar) was searched from 1970 to 2019. The complex biogenesis of exosomes and miRNAs was reviewed. Exosomes contain both viral and host miRNAs that can be used as diagnostic biomarkers for viral diseases. Viral proteins can alter miRNAs, and conversely miRNAs can alter the host response to viral infections in a positive or negative manner. It is expected that exosomal miRNAs will be increasingly used for diagnosis, monitoring and even treatment of viral infections.",Nahand JS; Mahjoubin-Tehran M; Moghoofei M; Pourhanifeh MH; Mirzaei HR; Asemi Z; Khatami A; Bokharaei-Salim F; Mirzaei H; Hamblin MR,Epigenomics,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32093516/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32077594,The role of nutrition in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Pathophysiology and management.,"A healthy diet together with physical activity could induce weight loss and control the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the composition of diet has not been clearly established. Macronutrients such as saturated fatty acids (SFA), trans-fats, simple sugars and animal proteins have a harmful effect on the liver. On the other hand, monounsaturated fats (MUFAs), polyunsaturated (PUFAs) omega-3-fats, plant-based proteins and dietary fibres are considered to be beneficial to the liver. The impact of specific micronutrients is less well-known. Nutrients are part of the food we eat. Food makes up our meals, which compose our dietary patterns. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients usually follow Western diets which are rich in soda, frozen junk food, juice, red meat, lard, processed meats, whole fat dairy foods, fatty snack foods, take-away foods, cakes and biscuits and poor in cereals, whole grains, fruit, vegetables, extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and fish. On the other hand, the Mediterranean diet (MD) is beneficial for NAFLD even when it is iso-caloric or there are no changes in body weight. A new approach, called 'nutritional geometry' considers the importance of integrating nutrition, animals and the environment. The goal of this approach is to combine nutrients and foods in a model to understand how food components interact to regulate the properties of diets affecting health and disease. The use of algorithms developed by artificial intelligence (AI) to create a personalized diet for patients can provide customized nutritional counselling to prevent and treat NAFLD.",Berná G; Romero-Gomez M,Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32077594/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32051759,All disease begins in the (leaky) gut: role of zonulin-mediated gut permeability in the pathogenesis of some chronic inflammatory diseases.,"Improved hygiene leading to reduced exposure to microorganisms has been implicated as one possible cause for the recent ""epidemic"" of chronic inflammatory diseases (CIDs) in industrialized countries. That is the essence of the hygiene hypothesis that argues that rising incidence of CIDs may be, at least in part, the result of lifestyle and environmental changes that have made us too ""clean"" for our own good, so causing changes in our microbiota. Apart from genetic makeup and exposure to environmental triggers, inappropriate increase in intestinal permeability (which may be influenced by the composition of the gut microbiota), a ""hyper-belligerent"" immune system responsible for the tolerance-immune response balance, and the composition of gut microbiome and its epigenetic influence on the host genomic expression have been identified as three additional elements in causing CIDs. During the past decade, a growing number of publications have focused on human genetics, the gut microbiome, and proteomics, suggesting that loss of mucosal barrier function, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, may substantially affect antigen trafficking, ultimately influencing the close bidirectional interaction between gut microbiome and our immune system. This cross-talk is highly influential in shaping the host gut immune system function and ultimately shifting genetic predisposition to clinical outcome. This observation led to a re-visitation of the possible causes of CIDs epidemics, suggesting a key pathogenic role of gut permeability. Pre-clinical and clinical studies have shown that the zonulin family, a group of proteins modulating gut permeability, is implicated in a variety of CIDs, including autoimmune, infective, metabolic, and tumoral diseases. These data offer novel therapeutic targets for a variety of CIDs in which the zonulin pathway is implicated in their pathogenesis.",Fasano A,F1000Research,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32051759/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31992991,Emerging Roles for Lymphatics in Chronic Liver Disease.,"Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a global health epidemic causing ∼2 million deaths annually worldwide. As the incidence of CLD is expected to rise over the next decade, understanding the cellular and molecular mediators of CLD is critical for developing novel therapeutics. Common characteristics of CLD include steatosis, inflammation, and cholesterol accumulation in the liver. While the lymphatic system in the liver has largely been overlooked, the liver lymphatics, as in other organs, are thought to play a critical role in maintaining normal hepatic function by assisting in the removal of protein, cholesterol, and immune infiltrate. Lymphatic growth, permeability, and/or hyperplasia in non-liver organs has been demonstrated to be caused by obesity or hypercholesterolemia in humans and animal models. While it is still unclear if changes in permeability occur in liver lymphatics, the lymphatics do expand in number and size in all disease etiologies tested. This is consistent with the lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) upregulating proliferation specific genes, however, other transcriptional changes occur in liver LECs that are dependent on the inflammatory mediators that are specific to the disease etiology. Whether these changes induce lymphatic dysfunction or if they impact liver function has yet to be directly addressed. Here, we will review what is known about liver lymphatics in health and disease, what can be learned from recent work on the influence of obesity and hypercholesterolemia on the lymphatics in other organs, changes that occur in LECs in the liver during disease and outstanding questions in the field.",Burchill MA; Goldberg AR; Tamburini BAJ,Frontiers in physiology,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31992991/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31991436,Human Milk as the First Source of Micronutrients.,"Well-nourished mothers are assumed to produce adequate concentrations of nutrients in their milk for optimal infant growth and development and infants should be exclusively breastfed during the first 6 months. It is important to know the nutrient content of human milk as this information is used to set recommended adequate intakes (AIs) for infants. Our review of existing information reveals that the AI recommendations are based on poor data. The milk content of a few nutrients may not be adequate to provide requirements for 6 months even in well-nourished mothers. Importantly, the concentrations of many micronutrients in milk are low when the mother consumes a poor quality diet. Our new efficient methods for milk nutrient analysis have enabled us to illuminate the large differences in milk micronutrient concentrations across populations, to examine the effects of milk collection protocols on nutrient concentrations, and to study the effects of maternal supplementation in pregnancy and/or lactation on milk micronutrient and infant status. The ongoing Mothers, Infants and Lactation Quality study proposes to answer some of these uncertainties. Two hundred and fifty healthy, well-nourished, unsupplemented mother-infant dyads in each of the 4 countries are being studied. The range of milk nutrient concentrations across the first 9 months postpartum will provide ""Reference Values"" against which other studies and surveys can evaluate the quality of milk and possibly target nutrients for treatment with supplements or fortification.",Allen LH; Hampel D,Nestle Nutrition Institute workshop series,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31991436/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31963760,Multiple Cell Signalling Pathways of Human Proinsulin C-Peptide in Vasculopathy Protection.,"A major hallmark of diabetes is a constant high blood glucose level (hyperglycaemia), resulting in endothelial dysfunction. Transient or prolonged hyperglycemia can cause diabetic vasculopathy, a secondary systemic damage. C-Peptide is a product of cleavage of proinsulin by a serine protease that occurs within the pancreatic β-cells, being secreted in similar amounts as insulin. The biological activity of human C-peptide is instrumental in the prevention of diabetic neuropathy, nephropathy and other vascular complications. The main feature of type 1 diabetes mellitus is the lack of insulin and of C-peptide, but the progressive β-cell loss is also observed in later stage of type 2 diabetes mellitus. C-peptide has multifaceted effects in animals and diabetic patients due to the activation of multiple cell signalling pathways, highlighting p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ½, Akt, as well as endothelial nitric oxide production. Recent works highlight the role of C-peptide in the prevention and amelioration of diabetes and also in organ-specific complications. Benefits of C-peptide in microangiopathy and vasculopathy have been shown through conservation of vascular function, and also in the prevention of endothelial cell death, microvascular permeability, neointima formation, and in vascular inflammation. Improvement of microvascular blood flow by replacing a physiological amount of C-peptide, in several tissues of diabetic animals and humans, mainly in nerve tissue, myocardium, skeletal muscle, and kidney has been described. A review of the multiple cell signalling pathways of human proinsulin C-peptide in vasculopathy protection is proposed, where the approaches to move beyond the state of the art in the development of innovative and effective therapeutic options of diabetic neuropathy and nephropathy are discussed.",Souto SB; Campos JR; Fangueiro JF; Silva AM; Cicero N; Lucarini M; Durazzo A; Santini A; Souto EB,International journal of molecular sciences,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31963760/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31950908,Clinical Management of Seafood Allergy.,"Seafood plays an important role in human nutrition and health. A good patient workup and sensitive diagnostic analysis of IgE antibody reactivity can distinguish between a true seafood allergy and other adverse reactions generated by toxins or parasites contaminating ingested seafood. The 2 most important seafood groupings include the fish and shellfish. Shellfish, in the context of seafood consumption, constitutes a diverse group of species subdivided into crustaceans and mollusks. The prevalence of shellfish allergy seems to be higher than that of fish allergy, with an estimate of up to 3% in the adult population and fin fish allergy prevalence of approximately 1%. Clinical evaluation of the seafood-allergic patient involves obtaining a detailed history and obtaining in vivo and/or in vitro testing with careful interpretation of results with consideration of cross-reactivity features of the major allergens. Oral food challenge is useful not only for the diagnosis but also for avoiding unnecessary dietary restrictions. In this review, we highlight some of the recent reports to provide solid clinical and laboratory tools for the differentiation of fish allergy from shellfish allergy, enabling best treatment and management of these patients.",Davis CM; Gupta RS; Aktas ON; Diaz V; Kamath SD; Lopata AL,The journal of allergy and clinical immunology.

In association with the damage of the skin integrity, the risk of infection is increased, posing an obstacle to healing and potentially leading to sepsis. Another limitation against healing is associated with antibiotic resistance mainly due to the use of systemic antibiotics for the treatment of localized infections.

AI, particularly deep learning, has recently made substantial strides in perception tasks allowing machines to better represent and interpret complex data. Deep learning is a subset of AI represented by the combination of artificial neuron layers. In the last years, deep learning has gained great momentum. In the field of orthopaedics and traumatology, some studies have been done using deep learning to detect fractures in radiographs. Deep learning studies to detect and classify fractures on computed tomography (CT) scans are even more limited. In this narrative review, we provide a brief overview of deep learning technology: we (1) describe the ways in which deep learning until now has been applied to fracture detection on radiographs and CT examinations; (2) discuss what value deep learning offers to this field; and finally (3) comment on future directions of this technology.",Kalmet PHS; Sanduleanu S; Primakov S; Wu G; Jochems A; Refaee T; Ibrahim A; Hulst LV; Lambin P; Poeze M,Acta orthopaedica,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31928116/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31882100,Quorum sensing in food spoilage and natural-based strategies for its inhibition.,"Food can harbor a variety of microorganisms including spoilage and pathogenic bacteria. Many bacterial processes, including production of degrading enzymes, virulence factors, and biofilm formation are known to depend on cell density through a process called quorum sensing (QS), in which cells communicate by synthesizing, detecting and reacting to small diffusible signaling molecules - autoinducers (AI). The disruption of QS could decisively contribute to control the expression of many harmful bacterial phenotypes. Several quorum sensing inhibitors (QSI) have been extensively studied, being many of them of natural origin. This review provides an analysis on the role of QS in food spoilage and biofilm formation within the food industry.

Covalent closed circular RNAs (circRNAs) are produced by a mechanism called ""back-splicing"" from mRNAs. They are highly stable and show cell and tissue specific expression patterns. Although some functions such as ""microRNA sponge"" and ""RNA binding protein sponge"" have been reported for a small number of circRNAs, the function of thousands of other circRNAs is still unknown. Dysregulation of circRNAs has been reported in many GI cancers and are involved in metastasis and invasion. CircRNAs have been reported to be useful as prognostic markers and targets for developing new treatments. We first describe the properties and biogenesis of circRNAs. We then summarize recent reports about circRNA functions, expression status, and their potential to be used as biomarkers in GI cancers including, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, gallbladder cancer and pancreatic cancer.",Naeli P; Pourhanifeh MH; Karimzadeh MR; Shabaninejad Z; Movahedpour A; Tarrahimofrad H; Mirzaei HR; Bafrani HH; Savardashtaki A; Mirzaei H; Hamblin MR,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31877535/,1,0,0,0,0,0

It is characterized by increased serum glucose, electrolyte disturbances (particularly hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia), vitamin depletion (especially vitamin B1 thiamine), fluid imbalance, and salt retention, with resulting impaired organ function and cardiac arrhythmias. The awareness of the medical and nursing staff is often too low in clinical practice, leading to under-diagnosis of this complication, which often has an unspecific clinical presentation.

31827641,Association between MIC-1 and Type 2 Diabetes: A Combined Analysis.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an epidemic disease that endangers human health seriously. Recently, a large number of reports have revealed that macrophage-inhibiting cytokine-1 (MIC-1) is linked with T2DM, but the results were inconclusive. The aim of this study was to perform bioinformatics analysis of the association between MIC-1 and T2DM. Datasets and relevant literatures were searched in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science till September 20, 2019. Expression levels of MIC-1 were extracted, pooled, and compared between T2DM cases and controls. In summary, 11 GEO datasets and 3 articles with 421 T2DM cases and 711 controls were finally included. The expression level of MIC-1 was significantly higher in T2DM patients compared with controls, with a standard mean difference (SMD) of 0.54 and a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 0.24-0.83; in blood samples, the difference was still significant (SMD = 0.65; 95%CI = 0.24-1.06). Meanwhile, the expression level of <i>MIC-1</i> plays a significant role in differentiating T2DM cases from controls; the combined sensitivity, specificity, and odds ratio were 0.83 (95%CI = 0.72-0.90), 0.59 (95%CI = 0.45-0.72), and 1.64 (95%CI = 1.35-1.99), respectively. The summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve demonstrated that the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.81 (95%CI = 0.77-0.84).

These clocks are acknowledged as a highly accurate molecular correlate of chronological age in humans and other vertebrates. Also, extensive research is aimed at their potential to quantify biological aging rates and test longevity or rejuvenating interventions. Here, we discuss key challenges to understand clock mechanisms and biomarker utility. This requires dissecting the drivers and regulators of age-related changes in single-cell, tissue- and disease-specific models, as well as exploring other epigenomic marks, longitudinal and diverse population studies, and non-human models.

31756034,MicroRNAs and exosomes: key players in HIV pathogenesis.,"HIV infection is well known to cause impairment of the human immune system, and until recently was a leading cause of death. It has been shown that T lymphocytes are the main targets of HIV. The virus inactivates T lymphocytes by interfering with a wide range of cellular and molecular targets, leading to suppression of the immune system. The objective of this review is to investigate to what extent microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in HIV pathogenesis. The scientific literature (Pubmed and Google scholar) for the period 1988-2019 was searched. Mounting evidence has revealed that miRNAs are involved in viral replication and immune response, whether by direct targeting of viral transcripts or through indirect modulation of virus-related host pathways. In addition, exosomes have been found to act as nanoscale carriers involved in HIV pathogenesis. These nanovehicles target their cargos (i.e. DNA, RNA, viral proteins and miRNAs) leading to alteration of the behaviour of recipient cells. miRNAs and exosomes are important players in HIV pathogenesis.

31753036,Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes: a new therapeutic approach to osteoarthritis?,"Degenerative disorders of joints, especially osteoarthritis (OA), result in persistent pain and disability and high costs to society. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms of OA have not yet been fully explained. OA is characterized by destruction of cartilage and loss of extracellular matrix (ECM). It is generally agreed that there is an association between pro-inflammatory cytokines and the development of OA. There is increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and ""a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs"" (ADAMTS). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been explored as a new treatment for OA during the last decade. It has been suggested that paracrine secretion of trophic factors, in which exosomes have a crucial role, contributes to the mechanism of MSC-based treatment of OA. The paracrine secretion of exosomes may play a role in the repair of joint tissue as well as MSC-based treatments for other disorders. Exosomes isolated from various stem cells may contribute to tissue regeneration in the heart, limbs, skin, and other tissues. Recent studies have indicated that exosomes (or similar particles) derived from MSCs may suppress OA development. Herein, for first time, we summarize the recent findings of studies on various exosomes derived from MSCs and their effectiveness in the treatment of OA. Moreover, we highlight the likely mechanisms of actions of exosomes in OA.",Mianehsaz E; Mirzaei HR; Mahjoubin-Tehran M; Rezaee A; Sahebnasagh R; Pourhanifeh MH; Mirzaei H; Hamblin MR,Stem cell research & therapy,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31753036/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31751757,Presentation and Management of Food Allergy in Breastfed Infants and Risks of Maternal Elimination Diets.,"Breastfeeding is currently recommended as the optimal source of nutrition to infants. However, there are several studies that have shown clinical IgE- and non-IgE-mediated reactions to foods in exclusively breastfeeding infants, specifically to cow's milk, egg, peanut, and fish. Literature suggests that antigenic food proteins present in human milk can be found in substantial enough amounts to elicit clinical reactions in some, already-sensitized infants, including anaphylaxis, eczema exacerbation, and non-IgE-mediated gastrointestinal food-allergic syndromes. Diagnosis of food allergy in a breastfed infant and identification of the trigger foods in the mother's diet can be especially challenging in infants with delayed symptoms, such as eczema and gastrointestinal symptoms. Management is further complicated in infants with atopic dermatitis, who have increased caloric needs and therefore in whom nutrition is an extremely important factor for growth and development. One needs to balance possible benefits with risks of further food sensitization through the skin when foods are eliminated from their diets. We review here the literature on clinical presentation and evidence for food allergy in exclusively breastfed infants, including the presence of food antigens in human milk. Incorporating clinical experience and the available data, which largely come from case reports and small, nonrandomized studies performed in referral centers with several limitations, we propose a novel algorithm to diagnosis and management, with emphasis on nutritional considerations.",Rajani PS; Martin H; Groetch M; Järvinen KM,The journal of allergy and clinical immunology.

Thirty-two studies met the inclusion criteria, 27 in the lung, four in the skin and one in the oesophagus. Meta-analysis of the three studies with prospective data collection of asthma diagnosis revealed a positive association with incident lung cancer (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.09-1.44); however, this result was not consistently supported by the larger dataset of retrospective studies (OR 1.37, 95% CI 0.90-1.83). Overall, studies in the lung displayed significant heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> 98%, P < .0001), but no significant effect modification on the association between asthma and lung cancer was identified for the variables of sex, smoking or study design. Meta-analysis could not be applied to the four papers reviewed in the skin, but three suggested an association between eczema and non-melanoma skin cancer, while the remaining study failed to identify an association between melanoma and eczema. A single study meeting inclusion criteria showed no association between EoE and oesophageal malignancy. The current data cannot exclude the possibility of an association between atopy and malignancy the lung, skin and oesophagus. The relationship between allergy and cancer should be explored further in prospective studies that any association identified between these conditions has the potential for significant public health implications.",Muir AB; Whelan KA; Dougherty MK; Aaron B; Navarre B; Aceves SS; Dellon ES; Jensen ET,Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31743536/,0,1,0,1,0,0
31717441,Management of Dehydration in Patients Suffering Swallowing Difficulties.,"Swallowing difficulties, also called dysphagia, can have various causes and may occur at many points in the swallowing process. The treatment and rehabilitation of dysphagia represent a major interdisciplinary and multiprofessional challenge. In dysphagic patients, dehydration is frequent and often accelerated as a result of limited fluid intake. This condition results from loss of water from the intracellular space, disturbing the normal levels of electrolytes and fluid interfering with metabolic processes and body functions. Dehydration is associated with increased morbidity and mortality rates. Dysphagic patients at risk of dehydration thus require close monitoring of their hydration state, and existing imbalances should be addressed quickly. This review gives an overview on dehydration, as well as its pathophysiology, risk factors, and clinical signs/symptoms in general. Available management strategies of dehydration are presented for oral, enteral, and parenteral fluid replacement.",Reber E; Gomes F; Dähn IA; Vasiloglou MF; Stanga Z,Journal of clinical medicine,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31717441/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31708530,Current status and future perspective of computational toxicology in drug safety assessment under ontological intellection.,"For the safety assessment of pharmaceuticals, initial data management requires accurate toxicological data acquisition, which is based on regulatory safety studies according to guidelines, and computational systems have been developed under the application of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). In addition to these regulatory toxicology studies, investigative toxicological study data for the selection of lead compound and candidate compound for clinical trials are directed to estimation by computational systems such as Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) and related expert systems. Furthermore, in the ""Go"" or ""No-Go"" decision of drug development, supportive utilization of a scientifically interpretable computational toxicology system is required for human safety evaluation. A pharmaceutical safety evaluator as a related toxicologist who is facing practical decision needs not only a data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) system that calls for the final consequence but also an explainable AI that can provide comprehensive information necessary for evaluation and can help with decision making. Through the explication and suggestion of information on the mechanism of toxic effects to safety assessment scientists, a subsidiary partnership system for risk assessment is ultimately to be a powerful tool that can indicate project-vector with data weight for the corresponding counterparts. To bridge the gaps between big data and knowledge, multi-dimensional thinking based on philosophical ontology theory is necessary for handling heterogeneous data for integration. In this review, we will explain the current state and future perspective of computational toxicology related to drug safety assessment from the viewpoint of ontology thinking.",Yamagata Y; Yamada H; Horii I,The Journal of toxicological sciences,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31708530/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We conducted a systematic review of VR acceptability, values and preferences among women in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) to inform further investment and/or guidance on VR use for HIV prevention. Following PRISMA guidelines, we used structured methods to search, screen, and extract data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies reporting quantitative outcomes of acceptability of the VR for any indication published 1/1970-2/2019 (PROSPERO: CRD42019122220). Of 1,110 records identified, 68 met inclusion criteria. Studies included women 15-50+ years from 25 LMIC for indications including HIV prevention, contraception, abnormal bleeding, and menopause. Overall VR acceptability was high (71-98% across RCTs; 62-100% across observational studies), with 80-100% continuation rates in RCTs and favorable ease of insertion (greater than 85%) and removal 89-99%). Users reported concerns about the VR getting lost in the body (8-43%), although actual expulsions and adverse events were generally infrequent. Most women disclosed use to partners, with some worrying about partner anger/violence. The VR was not felt during intercourse by 70-92% of users and 48-97% of partners. Acceptability improved over time both within studies (as women gained VR experience and worries diminished), and over chronological time (as the device was popularized). Women expressed preferences for accessible, long-acting, partner-approved methods that prevent both HIV and pregnancy, can be used without partner knowledge, and have no impact on sex and few side effects. This review was limited by a lack of standardization of acceptability measures and study heterogeneity. This systematic review suggests that most LMIC women users have a positive view of the VR that increases with familiarity of use; and, that many would consider the VR an acceptable future delivery device for HIV prevention or other indications.",Griffin JB; Ridgeway K; Montgomery E; Torjesen K; Clark R; Peterson J; Baggaley R; van der Straten A,PloS one,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31703094/,0,1,0,0,0,0
31702390,miRNAs derived from cancer-associated fibroblasts in colorectal cancer.,"Currently, the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is increasing across the world. The cancer stroma exerts an impact on the spread, invasion and chemoresistance of CRC. The tumor microenvironment involves a complex interaction between cancer cells and stromal cells, for example, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs can promote neoplastic angiogenesis and tumor development in CRC. Mounting evidence suggests that many miRNAs are overexpressed (miR-21, miR-329, miR-181a, miR-199a, miR-382 and miR-215) in CRC CAFs, and these miRNAs can influence the spread, invasiveness and chemoresistance in neighboring tumor cells via paracrine signaling. Herein, we summarize the pathogenic roles of miRNAs and CAFs in CRC. Moreover, for first time, we highlight the miRNAs derived from CRC-associated CAFs and their roles in CRC pathogenesis.",Savardashtaki A; Shabaninejad Z; Movahedpour A; Sahebnasagh R; Mirzaei H; Hamblin MR,Epigenomics,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31702390/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31629800,"Docosahexaenoic acid,22:6n-3: Its roles in the structure and function of the brain.","Docosahexaenoic acid,22:6n-3 (DHA) and its metabolites are vital for the structure and functional brain development of the fetus and infants, and also for maintenance of healthy brain function of adults. DHA is thought to be an essential nutrient required throughout the life cycle for the maintenance of overall brain health. The mode of actions of DHA and its derivatives at both cellular and molecular levels in the brain are emerging. DHA is the major prevalent fatty acid in the brain membrane. The brain maintains its fatty acid levels mainly via the uptake of plasma free fatty acids. Therefore, circulating plasma DHA is significantly related to cognitive abilities during ageing and is inversely associated with cognitive decline. The signaling pathways of DHA and its metabolites are involved in neurogenesis, antinociceptive effects, anti-apoptotic effect, synaptic plasticity, Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in brain diseases, and the functioning of nigrostriatal activities. Mechanisms of action of DHA metabolites on various processes in the brain are not yet well known. Epidemiological studies support a link between low habitual intake of DHA and a higher risk of brain disorders. A diet characterized by higher intakes of foods containing high in n-3 fatty acids, and/or lower intake of n-6 fatty acids was strongly associated with a lower Alzheimer's Disease and other brain disorders. Supplementation of DHA improves some behaviors associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and impulsive behavior, as well as cognition. Nevertheless, the outcomes of trials with DHA supplementation have been controversial. Many intervention studies with DHA have shown an apparent benefit in brain function. However, clinical trials are needed for definitive conclusions. Dietary deficiency of n-3 fatty acids during fetal development in utero and the postnatal state has detrimental effects on cognitive abilities. Further research in humans is required to assess a variety of clinical outcomes, including quality of life and mental status, by supplementation of DHA.",Mallick R; Basak S; Duttaroy AK,International journal of developmental neuroscience : the official journal of the International Society for Developmental Neuroscience,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31629800/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31591350,Sirtuins and SIRT6 in Carcinogenesis and in Diet.,"Sirtuins are a highly conserved family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent protein lysine modifying enzymes. They are key regulators for a wide variety of cellular and physiological processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, DNA damage and stress response, genome stability, cell survival, metabolism, energy homeostasis, organ development and aging. Aging is one of the major risk factors of cancer, as many of the physiological mechanisms and pathologies associated with the aging process also contribute to tumor initiation, growth and/or metastasis. This review focuses on one the mammalian sirtuins, SIRT6, which has emerged as an important regulator of longevity and appears to have multiple biochemical functions that interfere with tumor development and may be useful in cancer prevention and for site-specific treatment. The recent evidence of the role of SIRT6 in carcinogenesis is also discussed, focusing on the potential use of SIRT6 modulators in cancer nanomedicine.",de Céu Teixeira M; Sanchez-Lopez E; Espina M; Garcia ML; Durazzo A; Lucarini M; Novellino E; Souto SB; Santini A; Souto EB,International journal of molecular sciences,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31591350/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Typically, US omnivores obtain enough dietary EPA and DHA, but unless VGNs consume algal n-3 supplements, they rely on endogenous production of long-chain fatty acids. VGN diets have several possible concerns: (1) VGNs have high intakes of linoleic acid (LA) as compared to omnivore/non-vegetarian diets. (2) High intakes of LA competitively interfere with the endogenous conversion of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) to EPA and DHA. (3) High somatic levels of LA/low ALA indicate a decreased ALA conversion to EPA and DHA. (4) Some, not all VGNs meet the Dietary Reference Intake Adequate Intake (DRI-AI) for dietary ALA and (5) VGN diets are high in fiber, which possibly interferes with fat absorption. Consequently, health professionals and Registered Dietitians/Registered Dietitian Nutritionists working with VGNs need specific essential fatty acid diet guidelines. The purpose of this review was: (1) to suggest that VGNs have a DRI-AI Special Consideration requirement for ALA and LA based on VGN dietary and biochemical indicators of status and (2) to provide suggestions to ensure that VGNs receive adequate intakes of LA and ALA.",Burns-Whitmore B; Froyen E; Heskey C; Parker T; San Pablo G,Nutrients,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31590264/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Meta-analyses of standardised mean differences (SMDs) estimated from published and unpublished data. We searched Medline, bibliographies of key articles and reviews, and grey literature to identify studies from LMICs that collected data on early life exposures and child development. The most recent search was done on 4 November 2014. We then invited the first authors of the publications and investigators of unpublished studies to participate in the study. Studies that assessed at least one domain of child development in at least 100 children under 7 years of age and collected at least one early life factor of interest were included in the study. Linear regression models were used to assess SMDs in child development by parental and child factors within each study. We then produced pooled estimates across studies using random effects meta-analyses. We retrieved data from 21 studies including 20 882 children across 13 LMICs, to assess the associations of exposure to 14 major risk factors with child development. Children of mothers with secondary schooling had 0.14 SD (95% CI 0.05 to 0.25) higher cognitive scores compared with children whose mothers had primary education. Preterm birth was associated with 0.14 SD (-0.24 to -0.05) and 0.23 SD (-0.42 to -0.03) reductions in cognitive and motor scores, respectively. Maternal short stature, anaemia in infancy and lack of access to clean water and sanitation had significant negative associations with cognitive and motor development with effects ranging from -0.18 to -0.10 SDs.

31566705,Pathogenic role of exosomes and microRNAs in HPV-mediated inflammation and cervical cancer: A review.,"Cervical cancer (CC) is the fourth most common cause of cancer death in women. The most important risk factor for the development of CC is cervical infection with human papilloma virus (HPV). Inflammation is a protective strategy that is triggered by the host against pathogens such as viral infections that acts rapidly to activate the innate immune response. Inflammation is beneficial if it is brief and well controlled; however, if the inflammation is excessive or it becomes of chronic duration, it can produce detrimental effects. HPV proteins are involved, both directly and indirectly, in the development of chronic inflammation, which is a causal factor in the development of CC. However, other factors may also have a potential role in stimulating chronic inflammation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) (a class of noncoding RNAs) are strong regulators of gene expression. They have emerged as key players in several biological processes, including inflammatory pathways. Abnormal expression of miRNAs may be linked to the induction of inflammation that occurs in CC. Exosomes are a subset of extracellular vesicles shed by almost all types of cells, which can function as cargo transfer vehicles. Exosomes contain proteins and genetic material (including miRNAs) derived from their parent cells and can potentially affect recipient cells. Exosomes have recently been recognized to be involved in inflammatory processes and can also affect the immune response. In this review, we discuss the role of HPV proteins, miRNAs and exosomes in the inflammation associated with CC.",Sadri Nahand J; Moghoofei M; Salmaninejad A; Bahmanpour Z; Karimzadeh M; Nasiri M; Mirzaei HR; Pourhanifeh MH; Bokharaei-Salim F; Mirzaei H; Hamblin MR,International journal of cancer,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31566705/,1,0,0,0,0,0

While retrospective studies suggest that FMT is generally safe in the short term, particularly in immunocompetent patients and with rigorous donor screening, additional large prospective studies are needed. This particularly includes those at high risk for infectious complications, such as immunocompromised hosts. Further, long-term implications of altering the intestinal microbiome with FMT are not well understood.

31385229,"Neurofilament Light Chain as a Biomarker, and Correlation with Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Diagnosis of CNS-Related Disorders.","The search for diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for neurodegenerative conditions is of high importance, since these disorders may present difficulties in differential diagnosis. Biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity are required. Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a unique biomarker related to axonal damage and neural cell death, which is elevated in a number of neurological disorders, and can be detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well as blood, serum, or plasma samples. Although the NfL concentration in CSF is higher than that in blood, blood measurement may be easier in practice due to its lesser invasiveness, reproducibility, and convenience. Many studies have investigated NfL in both CSF and serum/plasma as a potential biomarker of neurodegenerative disorders. Neuroimaging biomarkers can also potentially improve detection of CNS-related disorders at an early stage. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are sensitive techniques to visualize neuroaxonal loss. Therefore, investigating the combination of NfL levels with indices extracted from MRI and DTI scans could potentially improve diagnosis of CNS-related disorders.

31354709,The Neonatal Fc Receptor (FcRn): A Misnomer?,"Antibodies are essential components of an adaptive immune response. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is the most common type of antibody found in circulation and extracellular fluids. Although IgG alone can directly protect the body from infection through the activities of its antigen binding region, the majority of IgG immune functions are mediated via proteins and receptors expressed by specialized cell subsets that bind to the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of IgG. Fc gamma (γ) receptors (FcγR) belong to a broad family of proteins that presently include classical membrane-bound surface receptors as well as atypical intracellular receptors and cytoplasmic glycoproteins. Among the atypical FcγRs, the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) has increasingly gained notoriety given its intimate influence on IgG biology and its ability to also bind to albumin. FcRn functions as a recycling or transcytosis receptor that is responsible for maintaining IgG and albumin in the circulation, and bidirectionally transporting these two ligands across polarized cellular barriers. More recently, it has been appreciated that FcRn acts as an immune receptor by interacting with and facilitating antigen presentation of peptides derived from IgG immune complexes (IC).

31265376,Applications of Photobiomodulation Therapy to Musculoskeletal Disorders and Osteoarthritis with Particular Relevance to Canada.,"<b><i>Background:</i></b> Musculoskeletal disorders caused by osteoarthritis (MSDs/OA) are a growing problem in the modern industrialized society in Canada. Overall aging of the general population and a progressive lack of exercise contribute to this alarming increase. Moreover, a range of chronic conditions including cardiovascular and mental diseases show significantly higher comorbidity with MSDs/OA. Conventional medical treatment for MSDs/OA includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opiate pain killers. These drugs have major drawbacks such as a relative lack of efficacy, potential for addiction, and even death (Vioxx scandal). Photobiomodulation (PBM) was discovered over 50 years ago but has still not attained widespread acceptance by the medical community. This is partly due to uncertainty about the precise molecular mechanisms of action and a bewildering array of different wavelengths and dosimetric parameters employed in reported studies. <b><i>Objective:</i></b> The goal of this review was to survey literature reports of PBM, also known as low-level laser therapy used for treatment of MSDs/OA, concentrating on the growth over time, different wavelengths employed, and application to different joints. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> We searched the PubMed database for publication of study on PBM to treat the most common joints. <b><i>Results:</i></b> We show that the field of PBM to treat MSDs/OA is expanding exponentially over the past 20 years. A trend has emerged over time for more power to achieve better effective treatments, and the understanding of the physiological effect of safe parameters has improved. There is, however, no consensus on the best set of parameters to treat a specific patient indication. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Finally, we highlight gaps in our knowledge and the barriers to further clinical trials.

31255604,The effects of supplementation with L-carnitine on apolipoproteins: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials.,"Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have reported that L-carnitin may change serum apolipoproteins. However, the results of RCTs are contradictory. Our objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize earlier RCTs on the effects of L-carnitine supplementation on apolipoproteins B100 and AI. ISI web of science, Ovid, PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched from inception to January 2019 using relevant keywords. Treatment effects were considered as weighted mean difference (MD) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval in concentrations of serum apolipoproteins. Random-effects model (Dersimonian-Liard) was used to estimate the overall summary effect. This meta-analysis was performed on fourteen trials. Our results indicated that L-carnitine supplementation has a non-significant effect on Apo B100 (mean difference (MD): 1.820 mg/dl; 95% CI: -3.367 to 7.006, p = 0.492) and Apo AI (MD: -0.119 mg/dl; 95% CI: -4.425 to 4.186, p = 0.957). We also found body mass index, L-carnitine dosage; health condition and intervention duration could change the results. We conclude that L-carnitine does not change Apo B100 and Apo AI concentration. Further trials with sufficient sample size are needed to confirm these findings.",Sheikhi A; Djafarian K; Askarpour M; Shab-Bidar S,European journal of pharmacology,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31255604/,0,1,0,1,0,0
31235187,"Boar semen improvement through sperm capacitation management, with emphasis on zinc ion homeostasis.","Critical to fertilization success, sperm capacitation within the female oviductal sperm reservoir endows mammalian spermatozoa with hyperactivated motility and capacity to fertilize. An elaborate cascade of signaling events during capacitation guides the redistribution of sperm plasma membrane seminolipid and cholesterol, Ca-influx and increases tyrosine phosphorylation to promote hyperactivated motility. Such events result in the remodeling of the sperm acrosome, increased fluidity and fusability of the plasma membrane, shedding of surface-adsorbed seminal plasma proteins that glue sperm heads to the oviductal epithelium and ultimately the release of hyperactivated spermatozoa from the oviductal sperm reservoir. Discovered recently, the capacitation-induced sperm zinc ion efflux and resultant zinc signatures are reflective of sperm capacitation status and fertilizing ability, inspiring the retrospection of zinc ion functions in the physiology and fertility of boar sperm and that of other species. This review also highlights the merit of the domestic boar as a biomedical model for spermatology and fertilization research. Relevant to the quest for better fertility management in the livestock industries, the benefits of zinc ion supplementation through nutrition and direct addition to extended semen are discussed in the context of artificial insemination (AI). Ideas are shared on future technologies for zinc management in AI doses and research on the sperm zinc-interacting proteome.",Sutovsky P; Kerns K; Zigo M; Zuidema D,Theriogenology,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31235187/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31201918,Immunosenescence: A systems-level overview of immune cell biology and strategies for improving vaccine responses.,"Immunosenescence contributes to a decreased capacity of the immune system to respond effectively to infections or vaccines in the elderly. The full extent of the biological changes that lead to immunosenescence are unknown, but numerous cell types involved in innate and adaptive immunity exhibit altered phenotypes and function as a result of aging. These manifestations of immunosenescence at the cellular level are mediated by dysregulation at the genetic level, and changes throughout the immune system are, in turn, propagated by numerous cellular interactions. Environmental factors, such as nutrition, also exert significant influence on the immune system during aging. While the mechanisms that govern the onset of immunosenescence are complex, systems biology approaches allow for the identification of individual contributions from each component within the system as a whole. Although there is still much to learn regarding immunosenescence, systems-level studies of vaccine responses have been highly informative and will guide the development of new vaccine candidates, novel adjuvant formulations, and immunotherapeutic drugs to improve vaccine responses among the aging population.",Crooke SN; Ovsyannikova IG; Poland GA; Kennedy RB,Experimental gerontology,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31201918/,0,1,0,0,0,0
31181319,CFIm25 and alternative polyadenylation: Conflicting roles in cancer.,"Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is now widely recognized to regulate gene expression. APA is an RNA-processing mechanism that generates distinct 3' termini on mRNAs, producing mRNA isoforms. Different factors influence the initiation and development of this process. CFIm25 (among others) is a cleavage and polyadenylation factor that plays a key role in the regulation of APA. Shortening of the 3'UTRs on mRNAs leads to enhanced cellular proliferation and tumorigenicity. One reason may be the up-regulation of growth promoting factors, such as Cyclin D1. Different studies have reported a dual role of CFIm25 in cancer (both oncogenic and tumor suppressor). microRNAs (miRNAs) may be involved in CFIm25 function as well as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). The present review focuses on the role of CFIm25 in cancer, cancer treatment, and possible involvement in other human diseases. We highlight the involvement of miRNAs and ceRNAs in the function of CFIm25 to affect gene expression. The lack of understanding of the mechanisms and regulation of CFIm25 and APA has underscored the need for further research regarding their role in cancer and other diseases.",Jafari Najaf Abadi MH; Shafabakhsh R; Asemi Z; Mirzaei HR; Sahebnasagh R; Mirzaei H; Hamblin MR,Cancer letters,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31181319/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31152163,A catalog of genetic loci associated with kidney function from analyses of a million individuals.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is responsible for a public health burden with multi-systemic complications. Through trans-ancestry meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and independent replication (n = 1,046,070), we identified 264 associated loci (166 new). Of these, 147 were likely to be relevant for kidney function on the basis of associations with the alternative kidney function marker blood urea nitrogen (n = 416,178). Pathway and enrichment analyses, including mouse models with renal phenotypes, support the kidney as the main target organ. A genetic risk score for lower eGFR was associated with clinically diagnosed CKD in 452,264 independent individuals. Colocalization analyses of associations with eGFR among 783,978 European-ancestry individuals and gene expression across 46 human tissues, including tubulo-interstitial and glomerular kidney compartments, identified 17 genes differentially expressed in kidney. Fine-mapping highlighted missense driver variants in 11 genes and kidney-specific regulatory variants.

31134099,"Impact of Obesity on Influenza A Virus Pathogenesis, Immune Response, and Evolution.","With the rising prevalence of obesity has come an increasing awareness of its impact on communicable disease. As a consequence of the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus pandemic, obesity was identified for the first time as a risk factor for increased disease severity and mortality in infected individuals. Over-nutrition that results in obesity causes a chronic state of meta-inflammation with systemic implications for immunity. Obese hosts exhibit delayed and blunted antiviral responses to influenza virus infection, and they experience poor recovery from the disease. Furthermore, the efficacy of antivirals and vaccines is reduced in this population and obesity may also play a role in altering the viral life cycle, thus complementing the already weakened immune response and leading to severe pathogenesis. Case studies and basic research in human cohorts and animal models have highlighted the prolonged viral shed in the obese host, as well as a microenvironment that permits the emergence of virulent minor variants. This review focuses on influenza A virus pathogenesis in the obese host, and on the impact of obesity on the antiviral response, viral shed, and viral evolution. We comprehensively analyze the recent literature on how and why viral pathogenesis is altered in the obese host along with the impact of the altered host and pathogenic state on viral evolutionary dynamics in multiple models. Finally, we summarized the effectiveness of current vaccines and antivirals in this populations and the questions that remain to be answered. If current trends continue, nearly 50% of the worldwide population is projected to be obese by 2050. This population will have a growing impact on both non-communicable and communicable diseases and may affect global evolutionary trends of influenza virus.",Honce R; Schultz-Cherry S,Frontiers in immunology,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31134099/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Vitamin A and vitamin D deficiencies result in less diverse, dysbiotic microbial communities and increased susceptibility to infection or injury of the gastrointestinal tract. The vitamin A and vitamin D receptors are nuclear receptors expressed by the host, but not the microbiota. Vitamin A- and vitamin D-mediated regulation of the intestinal epithelium and mucosal immune cells underlies the effects of these nutrients on the microbiota. Vitamin A and vitamin D regulate the expression of tight junction proteins on intestinal epithelial cells that are critical for barrier function in the gut. Other shared functions of vitamin A and vitamin D include the support of innate lymphoid cells that produce IL-22, suppression of IFN-γ and IL-17 by T cells, and induction of regulatory T cells in the mucosal tissues. There are some unique functions of vitamin A and D; for example, vitamin A induces gut homing receptors on T cells, while vitamin D suppresses gut homing receptors on T cells.

The purpose of the present study is to critically investigate the effectiveness of PS supplementation on Apo in adults.A comprehensive search was conducted of all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted up to September 2018 in the following databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus. Mean difference with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using a random-effects model (DerSimonian-Laird method).Fifty-one arms from 37 RCTs were included in the present meta-analysis. Findings showed that PS supplementation and fortification increased Apo-AI (weighted mean difference [WMD]: 0.014 mg/dl, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.028, <i>p</i> = 0.042) and Apo-CII (WMD: 0.303 mg/dl, 95% CI: 0.084, 0.523, <i>p</i> = 0.007) and lowered Apo-B (WMD: -0.063 mg/dl, 95% CI: -0.075, -0.051, <i>p</i> < 0.001), Apo-B/Apo-A-I ratio (WMD: -0.044 mg/dl, 95% CI: -0.062, -0.025, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and Apo-E (WMD: -0.255 mg/dl, 95% CI: -0.474, -0.036, <i>p</i> = 0.023). However, PS supplementation did not have significant effects on Apo-AII and Apo-CIII. PS supplementation or fortification significantly changes Apo-E (<i>r</i> = -0.137, <i>p</i> nonlinearity = 0.006) and Apo-CIII (<i>r</i> = 1.26, <i>p</i> nonlinearity = 0.028) based on PS dosage (mg/d) and Apo-CIII (<i>r</i> = 3.34, <i>p</i> nonlinearity = 0.013) and Apo-CII (<i>r</i> = 1.09, <i>p</i> nonlinearity = 0.017) based on trial duration (weeks) in a nonlinear fashion.Based on our findings, supplements or fortified foods containing PS might have a considerable favorite effect in achieving Apo profile target; however, due to high heterogeneity among included studies, results must be interpreted with caution.KEY TEACHING POINTSCardiovascular diseases (CVDs) recognized as main public health concern worldwide with considerable mortality of all global deaths.Apo-lipoproteins are amphipathic molecules involved in the lipoprotein metabolism which introduced as <i>biomarkers in the evaluation of CVD risk</i>.Phytosterols bioactive components of plants have important biological functions in cholesterol metabolism in humans.Here we showed that phytosterols and phytostanols improve apo-lipoproteins profile of humans; finding from meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.Phytosterols supplementation lowered atherogenic apo-lipoproteins (Apo-B and Apo-E) and increased anti-atherogenic apo-lipoproteins (Apo-AI, Apo-CII).",Ghaedi E; Kord-Varkaneh H; Mohammadi H; Askarpour M; Miraghajani M,Journal of the American College of Nutrition,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31074692/,0,1,0,1,0,0
31040040,Necrotizing enterocolitis totalis: High mortality in the absence of an aggressive surgical approach.,"Necrotizing enterocolitis is the leading case of gastrointestinal-related morbidity in premature infants. Necrotizing enterocolitis totalis is an aggressive form of necrotizing enterocolitis, which has traditionally been managed with comfort care. Recent advances in management of short bowel syndrome have resulted in some reported long-term survival. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, studies that reported outcomes in children with necrotizing enterocolitis totalis were identified. The definition of necrotizing enterocolitis totalis was captured along with length of follow-up, patient demographics, and outcomes. A total of 766 articles were screened, of which 166 were selected for full article review. Of these, 32 articles included data on 414 patients with necrotizing enterocolitis totalis. In the majority of studies (52%), necrotizing enterocolitis totalis was not defined. Aggressive surgical therapy (defined as bowel resection or fecal diversion) was undertaken in 32 patients (7.7%), with a mortality rate of 68.8%. In contrast, nonaggressive surgical therapy was undertaken in 382 patients (92.3%), and the mortality in these patients was 95%. Long-term outcomes for necrotizing enterocolitis totalis survivors, such as length of time on parenteral nutrition, progression to liver and/or small bowel transplant, and quality of life, were not reported. We found that there is no accepted definition of necrotizing enterocolitis totalis. Aggressive surgical therapy is rarely pursued, which likely drives the overall high mortality rate. This study underscores the importance of standardizing the definition of necrotizing enterocolitis totalis and capturing short and long-term outcomes prospectively. With more aggressive surgical therapy, more infants are likely to survive this abdominal catastrophe, which was once thought to be uniformly fatal.",Dukleska K; Devin CL; Martin AE; Miller JM; Sullivan KM; Levy C; Prestowitz S; Flathers K; Vinocur CD; Berman L,Surgery,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31040040/,0,1,0,0,0,1

They include multiple dimensions and functions of food systems trying to provide solutions for harmonic co-evolution of humanity and planet Earth. ""Nutritional Sustainability"" is differentiated from other concepts which combine nutrition and sustainability as it not only sets environmental sustaining capacity as a baseline level for balanced nutrition, but also aims for the search of food system driving nodes. It does not aim for the support of solutions of producing enough or more food for increasing population (sustainable nutrition), neither does it contradict other similar concepts [sustainable nutrition security, nutritional life cycle assessment (LCA)]. However, it calls for more definite estimation of the carrying capacity of the environment on personal, local, and national levels for the development of more efficient solutions of nutrition balanced in the limits of environmental carrying capacity.

31016375,The role of polyamines in the regulation of macrophage polarization and function.,"Naturally occurring polyamines are ubiquitously distributed and play important roles in cell development, amino acid and protein synthesis, oxidative DNA damage, proliferation, and cellular differentiation. Macrophages are essential in the innate immune response, and contribute to tissue remodeling. Naïve macrophages have two major potential fates: polarization to (1) the classical pro-inflammatory M1 defense response to bacterial pathogens and tumor cells, and (2) the alternatively activated M2 response, induced in the presence of parasites and wounding, and also implicated in the development of tumor-associated macrophages. ODC, the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine synthesis, leads to an increase in putrescine levels, which impairs M1 gene transcription. Additionally, spermidine and spermine can regulate translation of pro-inflammatory mediators in activated macrophages. In this review, we focus on polyamines in macrophage activation patterns in the context of gastrointestinal inflammation and carcinogenesis. We seek to clarify mechanisms of innate immune regulation by polyamine metabolism and potential novel therapeutic targets.",Latour YL; Gobert AP; Wilson KT,Amino acids,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31016375/,1,0,0,0,0,0

30990817,Associations of variants In the hexokinase 1 and interleukin 18 receptor regions with oxyhemoglobin saturation during sleep.,"Sleep disordered breathing (SDB)-related overnight hypoxemia is associated with cardiometabolic disease and other comorbidities. Understanding the genetic bases for variations in nocturnal hypoxemia may help understand mechanisms influencing oxygenation and SDB-related mortality. We conducted genome-wide association tests across 10 cohorts and 4 populations to identify genetic variants associated with three correlated measures of overnight oxyhemoglobin saturation: average and minimum oxyhemoglobin saturation during sleep and the percent of sleep with oxyhemoglobin saturation under 90%. The discovery sample consisted of 8,326 individuals. Variants with p < 1 × 10(-6) were analyzed in a replication group of 14,410 individuals. We identified 3 significantly associated regions, including 2 regions in multi-ethnic analyses (2q12, 10q22). SNPs in the 2q12 region associated with minimum SpO2 (rs78136548 p = 2.70 × 10(-10)). SNPs at 10q22 were associated with all three traits including average SpO2 (rs72805692 p = 4.58 × 10(-8)). SNPs in both regions were associated in over 20,000 individuals and are supported by prior associations or functional evidence. Four additional significant regions were detected in secondary sex-stratified and combined discovery and replication analyses, including a region overlapping Reelin, a known marker of respiratory complex neurons.These are the first genome-wide significant findings reported for oxyhemoglobin saturation during sleep, a phenotype of high clinical interest.

This review is aimed to present our current knowledge on biological mechanisms involved in adiposity-related gastrointestinal carcinogenesis supported by results collected in epidemiological studies.",Karczewski J; Begier-Krasińska B; Staszewski R; Popławska E; Gulczynska-Elhadi K; Dobrowolska A,Digestive diseases and sciences,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30968228/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30950797,Applications of Machine Learning in Real-Life Digital Health Interventions: Review of the Literature.,"Machine learning has attracted considerable research interest toward developing smart digital health interventions. These interventions have the potential to revolutionize health care and lead to substantial outcomes for patients and medical professionals. Our objective was to review the literature on applications of machine learning in real-life digital health interventions, aiming to improve the understanding of researchers, clinicians, engineers, and policy makers in developing robust and impactful data-driven interventions in the health care domain. We searched the PubMed and Scopus bibliographic databases with terms related to machine learning, to identify real-life studies of digital health interventions incorporating machine learning algorithms. We grouped those interventions according to their target (ie, target condition), study design, number of enrolled participants, follow-up duration, primary outcome and whether this had been statistically significant, machine learning algorithms used in the intervention, and outcome of the algorithms (eg, prediction). Our literature search identified 8 interventions incorporating machine learning in a real-life research setting, of which 3 (37%) were evaluated in a randomized controlled trial and 5 (63%) in a pilot or experimental single-group study. The interventions targeted depression prediction and management, speech recognition for people with speech disabilities, self-efficacy for weight loss, detection of changes in biopsychosocial condition of patients with multiple morbidity, stress management, treatment of phantom limb pain, smoking cessation, and personalized nutrition based on glycemic response. The average number of enrolled participants in the studies was 71 (range 8-214), and the average follow-up study duration was 69 days (range 3-180). Of the 8 interventions, 6 (75%) showed statistical significance (at the P=.05 level) in health outcomes. This review found that digital health interventions incorporating machine learning algorithms in real-life studies can be useful and effective. Given the low number of studies identified in this review and that they did not follow a rigorous machine learning evaluation methodology, we urge the research community to conduct further studies in intervention settings following evaluation principles and demonstrating the potential of machine learning in clinical practice.",Triantafyllidis AK; Tsanas A,Journal of medical Internet research,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30950797/,1,0,0,0,0,1
30935531,Effects of Royal jelly on metabolic variables in diabetes mellitus: A systematic review.,"Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common endocrine disorders in the world. This systematic review was conducted with focus on the current knowledge on the effect of royal jelly on metabolic variables in diabetes mellitus. PubMed, Scopus, Embase, ProQuest and Google Scholar databases were searched from inception until June 2018. All clinical trials and animal studies that evaluated the effects of royal jelly on diabetes mellitus, and were published in English-language journals were eligible. Studies that provided insufficient outcomes were excluded. Out of 522 articles found in the search, only twelve articles were eligible for analysis. Seven studies showed a significant reduction in FBS, and one reported HbA1c decrease following royal jelly supplementation. Although royal jelly supplementation resulted in significant reductions in HOM A-I R in three studies, the findings on insulin levels were controversial. In addition, royal jelly substantially improved serum levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, HDL, LDL, VLDL and Apo-A1 in diabetes mellitus. In addition, royal jelly resulted in a decrease oxidative stress indicators and increase antioxidant enzymes levels. In conclusion, royal jelly could improve glycemic status, lipid profiles and oxidative stress in diabetes mellitus.

Mobile health has become a field of interest as a tool for childcare, especially as a means for parents of children with diverse diseases and a resource to promote their health conditions. Current systematic review was conducted to survey the functionalities of available applications on the mobile platform to support pediatrics intelligent diagnosis and children healthcare. Results which met the inclusion criteria (such as patient monitoring, decision support, diagnosis support) were obtained, assessed and organised into a checklist. In this study, 379 potential apps were identified using the search feature in Apple App Store and Google Play Store. After careful consideration of the selected apps, only three (Google Play Store) and one (iTunes Store), fulfilled all the general inclusion criteria and special criteria, such as intelligence tools.

30850271,The effect of l-carnitine supplementation on lipid profile and glycaemic control in adults with cardiovascular risk factors: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials.,"Several randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have investigated the effect of l-carnitine supplementation on lipid profile and glycaemic control in adults with cardiovascular risk factors; however, the results were conflicting. Therefore, a meta-analysis was performed to assess the eﬀect of l-carnitine on lipid profile and glycaemic control in adults with cardiovascular risk factors. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Databases, Google Scholar, ProQuest, Web of Science and Embase for randomized, placebo-controlled human trials that investigated the effect of l-carnitine supplementation on lipid profile and glycaemic control up to April 2017. From the eligible trials, 24 articles were selected for the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis was performed in a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was determined by I<sup>2</sup> statistics and Cochrane Q test. The result showed significant effect of l-carnitine on TC (WMD: -13.73 [95% CI: -22.28, -5.17] mg/dL; P < 0.001), LDL-C (WMD = - 7.70 [95% CI: - 11.80, -3.61]mg/dL; p < 0.001), HDL-C (WMD = 0.82 [95% CI: 0.44, 1.21] mg/dL; P > 0.001), Lp(a) (WMD = - 7.13 [95% CI: -9.82,- 4.43]mg/dL; P < 0.001), FPG (WMD = -6.25 [95% CI: -10.35, -2.16] mg/dL; P < 0.001), HbA1C (WMD (%) = - 0.35 [95% CI: -0.65,- 0.05]; p = 0.02) and HOMA-IR (WMD (%) = - 0.94 [95% CI: -1.89, -0.00]; P = 0.05). No effect of l-carnitine was detected in TG, Apo A-I and Apo B 100 on pooled effect size. Additionally, sensitivity analysis showed l-carnitine supplementation could improve glycaemic control, particularly along with hypocaloric diet. This meta-analysis showed that l-carnitine supplementation could improve lipid profile levels, particularly in doses more than 1500 mg/day. More RCTs with large sample sizes, focusing on gut microbiome profiles and dietary patterns are needed to better understand the effect of l-carnitine on patients with cardiovascular risk factors.",Asadi M; Rahimlou M; Shishehbor F; Mansoori A,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30850271/,0,1,0,1,0,0
30781836,Roles of PI3K/AKT/GSK3 Pathway Involved in Psychiatric Illnesses.,"Psychiatric illnesses may be qualified to the cellular impairments of the function for survival or death in neurons, which may consequently appear as abnormalities in the neuroplasticity. The molecular mechanism has not been well understood, however, it seems that PI3K, AKT, GSK3, and their downstream molecules have crucial roles in the pathogenesis. Through transducing cell surviving signal, the PI3K/AKT/GSK3 pathway may organize an intracellular central network for the action of the synaptic neuroplasticity. In addition, the pathways may also regulate cell proliferation, cell migration, and apoptosis. Several lines of evidence have supported a role for this signaling network underlying the development and treatment for psychiatric illnesses. Indeed, the discovery of molecular biochemical phenotypes would represent a breakthrough in the research for effective treatment. In this review, we summarize advances on the involvement of the PI3K/AKT/GSK3 pathways in cell signaling of neuronal cells. This study may provide novel insights on the mechanism of mental disorder involved in psychiatric illnesses and would open future opportunity for contributions suggesting new targets for diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedures.",Matsuda S; Ikeda Y; Murakami M; Nakagawa Y; Tsuji A; Kitagishi Y,"Diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30781836/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30696516,Nutritional challenges for older adults in Europe: current status and future directions.,"Population ageing is rapidly progressing and it is estimated that by 2050 one in every five people globally will be aged 60 years or over. Research has shown that adequate nutritional status can positively impact the ageing process, resulting in improved quality of life and the prevention of chronic disease and mortality. However, due to physiological and social changes associated with ageing, older adults may be at increased risk of nutrient deficiencies. This review aims to investigate the nutrient intake and status of older adults in Europe and to explore the potential role of fortified foods and nutritional supplements in addressing some of the nutritional challenges identified in this population group. The available literature has highlighted unfavourable intakes of total and saturated fat, sugar, salt and dietary fibre together with low intakes and suboptimal status of key micronutrients such as vitamins D, B2, B12, folate and calcium. Evidence has shown that the consumption of fortified foods and use of nutritional supplements make significant contributions to intakes and status of these micronutrients in older adults. Continued monitoring of nutrient intake and status is important in light of changing fortification practices and food consumption patterns. Future strategies to address the nutritional issues identified in older adults could include the promotion of healthy food choices together with improvements of the food supply including reformulation (fat, sugar and salt), food fortification or supplementation to support successful ageing of our populations.",Kehoe L; Walton J; Flynn A,The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30696516/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30694990,The parallel paradigm between intestinal transplant inflammation and inflammatory bowel disease.,"A significant shift in our understanding of the molecular and cellular basis for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) mirrors research that has been ongoing in intestinal transplantation. The blurring of lines between these two disease states creates an avenue into potential therapeutic interventions which take advantage of these molecular similarities. Traditional knowledge of T-cell involvement in IBD has expanded to highlight the role of T helper 17 (Th17) cells as key effector cells. A similar role has been demonstrated in cellular rejection of intestinal allografts. Genetic polymorphism related to the propagation and function of Th17 cells has been found to confer significant risk of developing autoimmune conditions. Interleukin-23, a cytokine identified as crucial to the expansion of Th17 cells, has become a validated molecular target in psoriatic arthritis and IBD, and could become a target for intestinal transplant therapies. Intestinal transplant rejection and IBD share a similar phenotype, especially as it relates to key effector cells and gene polymorphisms. Improvements in our understanding of the immune-pathogenesis of IBD, as well as molecular targeting exploiting that knowledge, provide a potential route to improve outcomes for intestinal transplant patients.",Belyayev L; Loh K; Fishbein TM; Kroemer A,Current opinion in organ transplantation,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30694990/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30655036,Nutrition and Bipartite Metabolism of Intracellular Pathogens.,"The host is a nutrient-rich niche for microbial pathogens, but one that comes with obstacles and challenges. Many intracellular pathogens like Legionella pneumophila, Coxiella burnetii, Listeria monocytogenes, and Chlamydia trachomatis have developed bipartite metabolism within their hosts. This style of metabolic regulation enables pathogen sensing of specific nutrients to engage them into catabolic and anabolic processes, and contributes to temporal and spatial pathogen phenotypic modulation. Not only have intracellular pathogens adapted their metabolism to the host, they have also acquired idiosyncratic strategies to exploit host nutritional supplies and intercept metabolites. Francisella tularensis and Anaplasma phagocytophilum alter host autophagy, Shigella flexneri intercepts all host pyruvate, while L. pneumophila induces host protein degradation and blocks protein translation. Strategies of pathogen manipulation of host nutrients could serve as therapeutic targets.",Best A; Abu Kwaik Y,Trends in microbiology,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30655036/,1,0,0,0,0,0

They are heritable<sup>2,3</sup> and etiologically related<sup>4,5</sup> behaviors that have been resistant to gene discovery efforts<sup>6-11</sup>. In sample sizes up to 1.2 million individuals, we discovered 566 genetic variants in 406 loci associated with multiple stages of tobacco use (initiation, cessation, and heaviness) as well as alcohol use, with 150 loci evidencing pleiotropic association. Smoking phenotypes were positively genetically correlated with many health conditions, whereas alcohol use was negatively correlated with these conditions, such that increased genetic risk for alcohol use is associated with lower disease risk. We report evidence for the involvement of many systems in tobacco and alcohol use, including genes involved in nicotinic, dopaminergic, and glutamatergic neurotransmission.

30640893,"Chylomicron retention disease: genetics, biochemistry, and clinical spectrum.","Chylomicron retention disease (CRD) is an autosomic recessive disorder, in which intestinal fat malabsorption is the main cause of diverse severe manifestations. The specific molecular defect was identified in 2003 and consists of mutations in the SAR1B or SARA2 gene encoding for intracellular SAR1B GTPase protein. The aim of this review is first to provide an update of the recent biochemical, genetic and clinical findings, and second to discuss novel mechanisms related to hallmark symptoms. CRD patients present with SAR1B mutations, which disable the formation of coat protein complex II and thus blocks the transport of chylomicron cargo from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. Consequently, there is a total absence of chylomicron and apolipoprotein B-48 in the blood circulation following a fat meal, accompanied by a deficiency in liposoluble vitamins and essential fatty acids. The recent discovery of Transport and Golgi organization and Transport and Golgi organization-like proteins may explain the intriguing export of large chylomicron, exceeding coat protein complex II size. Hypocholesterolemia could be accounted for by a decrease in HDL cholesterol, likely a reflection of limited production of intestinal HDL in view of reduced ATP-binding cassette family A protein 1 and apolipoprotein A-I protein. In experimental studies, the paralog SAR1A compensates for the lack of the SAR1B GTPase protein. Molecular testing for CRD is recommended to distinguish the disease from other congenital fat malabsorptions, and to early define molecular aberrations, accelerate treatment, and prevent complications.",Levy E; Poinsot P; Spahis S,Current opinion in lipidology,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30640893/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30599936,Interplay between food and gut microbiota in health and disease.,"Numerous microorganisms colonize the human gastrointestinal tract playing pivotal roles in relation to digestion and absorption of dietary components. They biotransform food components and produce metabolites, which in combination with food components shape and modulate the host immune system and metabolic responses. Reciprocally, the diet modulates the composition and functional capacity of the gut microbiota, which subsequently influence host biochemical processes establishing a system of mutual interaction and inter-dependency. Macronutrients, fibers, as well as polyphenols and prebiotics are strong drivers shaping the composition of the gut microbiota. Especially, short-chain fatty acids produced from ingested fibers and tryptophan metabolites are key in modulating host immune responses. Since reciprocal interactions between diet, host, and microbiota are personal, understanding this complex network of interactions calls for novel use of large datasets and the implementation of machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence. In this review, we aim to provide a base for future investigations of how interactions between food components and gut microbiota may influence or even determine human health and disease.",Danneskiold-Samsøe NB; Dias de Freitas Queiroz Barros H; Santos R; Bicas JL; Cazarin CBB; Madsen L; Kristiansen K; Pastore GM; Brix S; Maróstica Júnior MR,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30599936/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32188562,Factors affecting embryo production in superovulated Bos taurus cattle.,"Despite a long history of bovine superovulation research, significant commercial applications did not start until the early 1970s. For some 20 years thereafter, superovulation represented the primary tool for the production of cattle embryos. In the early 1990s, commercial invitro production (IVP) was initiated in cattle. Although ovum pick-up and IVP are now commercially practiced on a wide scale, superovulation and embryo recovery by flushing remain a widespread and very effective approach to the production of cattle embryos. This review covers both the history and the effects of multiple factors on superovulation in Bos taurus cattle. There are three general protocols for suitable pre-FSH programming of donors so that gonadotrophin-responsive follicles are available. Superovulation protocols vary widely based on the FSH source, the diluent used, the number and timing of FSH injections and the timing and utilisation of various prostaglandins, controlled internal progesterone releasing devices, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone, and other means of controlling follicular development and ovulation. The number of oocytes that can be stimulated to grow and ovulate within any given donor can be estimated by either ultrasound-guided sonography or by measuring concentrations of anti-Müllerian hormone in the blood. Animal-related factors that can influence the efficacy of superovulation include cattle breed, age, parity, genetics, lactational status and reproductive history. In addition, nutrition, stress, season, climate, weather and several semen factors are discussed.",Mikkola M; Hasler JF; Taponen J,"Reproduction, fertility, and development",2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32188562/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30579849,Epigenome-wide meta-analysis of DNA methylation and childhood asthma.,"Epigenetic mechanisms, including methylation, can contribute to childhood asthma. Identifying DNA methylation profiles in asthmatic patients can inform disease pathogenesis. We sought to identify differential DNA methylation in newborns and children related to childhood asthma. Within the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics consortium, we performed epigenome-wide meta-analyses of school-age asthma in relation to CpG methylation (Illumina450K) in blood measured either in newborns, in prospective analyses, or cross-sectionally in school-aged children. We also identified differentially methylated regions. In newborns (8 cohorts, 668 cases), 9 CpGs (and 35 regions) were differentially methylated (epigenome-wide significance, false discovery rate < 0.05) in relation to asthma development. In a cross-sectional meta-analysis of asthma and methylation in children (9 cohorts, 631 cases), we identified 179 CpGs (false discovery rate < 0.05) and 36 differentially methylated regions. In replication studies of methylation in other tissues, most of the 179 CpGs discovered in blood replicated, despite smaller sample sizes, in studies of nasal respiratory epithelium or eosinophils. Pathway analyses highlighted enrichment for asthma-relevant immune processes and overlap in pathways enriched both in newborns and children. Gene expression correlated with methylation at most loci. Functional annotation supports a regulatory effect on gene expression at many asthma-associated CpGs. Several implicated genes are targets for approved or experimental drugs, including IL5RA and KCNH2. Novel loci differentially methylated in newborns represent potential biomarkers of risk of asthma by school age. Cross-sectional associations in children can reflect both risk for and effects of disease. Asthma-related differential methylation in blood in children was substantially replicated in eosinophils and respiratory epithelium.",Reese SE; Xu CJ; den Dekker HT; Lee MK; Sikdar S; Ruiz-Arenas C; Merid SK; Rezwan FI; Page CM; Ullemar V; Melton PE; Oh SS; Yang IV; Burrows K; Söderhäll C; Jima DD; Gao L; Arathimos R; Küpers LK; Wielscher M; Rzehak P; Lahti J; Laprise C; Madore AM; Ward J; Bennett BD; Wang T; Bell DA; Vonk JM; Håberg SE; Zhao S; Karlsson R; Hollams E; Hu D; Richards AJ; Bergström A; Sharp GC; Felix JF; Bustamante M; Gruzieva O; Maguire RL; Gilliland F; Baïz N; Nohr EA; Corpeleijn E; Sebert S; Karmaus W; Grote V; Kajantie E; Magnus MC; Örtqvist AK; Eng C; Liu AH; Kull I; Jaddoe VWV; Sunyer J; Kere J; Hoyo C; Annesi-Maesano I; Arshad SH; Koletzko B; Brunekreef B; Binder EB; Räikkönen K; Reischl E; Holloway JW; Jarvelin MR; Snieder H; Kazmi N; Breton CV; Murphy SK; Pershagen G; Anto JM; Relton CL; Schwartz DA; Burchard EG; Huang RC; Nystad W; Almqvist C; Henderson AJ; Melén E; Duijts L; Koppelman GH; London SJ,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30579849/,0,0,0,1,0,0
30558128,The Dietary Intake and Practices of Adolescent Girls in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Review.,"In many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) the double burden of malnutrition is high among adolescent girls, leading to poor health outcomes for the adolescent herself and sustained intergenerational effects. This underpins the importance of adequate dietary intake during this period of rapid biological development. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the current dietary intake and practices among adolescent girls (10⁻19 years) in LMICs. We searched relevant databases and grey literature using MeSH terms and keywords. After applying specified inclusion and exclusion criteria, 227 articles were selected for data extraction, synthesis, and quality assessment. Of the included studies, 59% were conducted in urban populations, 78% in school settings, and dietary measures and indicators were inconsistent. Mean energy intake was lower in rural settings (1621 ± 312 kcal/day) compared to urban settings (1906 ± 507 kcal/day). Self-reported daily consumption of nutritious foods was low; on average, 16% of girls consumed dairy, 46% consumed meats, 44% consumed fruits, and 37% consumed vegetables. In contrast, energy-dense and nutrient-poor foods, like sweet snacks, salty snacks, fast foods, and sugar-sweetened beverages, were consumed four to six times per week by an average of 63%, 78%, 23%, and 49% of adolescent girls, respectively. 40% of adolescent girls reported skipping breakfast. Along with highlighting the poor dietary habits of adolescent girls in LMIC, this review emphasizes the need for consistently measured and standardized indicators, and dietary intake data that are nationally representative.",Keats EC; Rappaport AI; Shah S; Oh C; Jain R; Bhutta ZA,Nutrients,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30558128/,0,1,0,0,0,0

30510440,"Precision pharmacotherapy: psychiatry's future direction in preventing, diagnosing, and treating mental disorders.","Mental disorders account for around one-third of disability worldwide and cause enormous personal and societal burden. Current pharmacotherapies and nonpharmacotherapies do help many patients, but there are still high rates of partial or no response, delayed effect, and unfavorable adverse effects. The current diagnostic taxonomy of mental disorders by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the International Classification of Diseases relies on presenting signs and symptoms, but does not reflect evidence from neurobiological and behavioral systems. However, in the last decades, the understanding of biological mechanisms underlying mental disorders has grown and can be used for the development of precision medicine, that is, to deliver a patient-tailored individual treatment. Precision medicine may incorporate genetic variants contributing to the mental disorder and the response to pharmacotherapies, but also consider gene <b>¥</b> environment interactions, blood-based markers, neuropsychological tests, data from electronic health records, early life adversity, stressful life events, and very proximal factors such as lifestyle, nutrition, and sport.

Some studies have discussed that magnesium levels are lower in the serum and erythrocytes of children with ADHD. However, these findings are controversial. The aim of our study is to identify whether magnesium levels are in fact lower in children with ADHD. We conducted a thorough search of the literature and examined the connection between magnesium insufficiency and ADHD. A total of twelve studies were included into the current meta-analysis. The results of our meta-analysis found that peripheral blood magnesium levels, either in plasma, serum, or whole blood, of children diagnosed with ADHD were significantly lower than those in controls (k = 8, Hedges' g = -0.547, 95% CI = -0.818 to -0.276, p < .001). The subgroup meta-analysis with serum sample sources also suggested that peripheral serum magnesium levels of children diagnosed with ADHD were significantly lower than those in controls (k = 6, Hedges' g = -0.733, 95% CI = -0.911 to -0.555, p < .001). The subgroup meta-analysis focusing on subjects with ADHD diagnosed by definite diagnostic criteria also suggested significantly lower peripheral serum magnesium levels in ADHD children than those in controls (k = 4, Hedges' g = -0.780, 95% CI = -0.985 to -0.574, p < .001). We also noted that magnesium levels in the hair of children diagnosed with ADHD were significantly lower than those in controls (k = 4, Hedges' g = -0.713, 95% CI = -1.359 to -0.067, p = .031). In this meta-analysis, we found that children diagnosed with ADHD have lower serum and hair magnesium levels than children without ADHD. Further study may be needed to investigate the behavioral influence on ADHD due to lower magnesium levels, the association between brain and serum magnesium levels, and the effects brought about by larger longitudinal cohort studies.",Huang YH; Zeng BY; Li DJ; Cheng YS; Chen TY; Liang HY; Yang WC; Lin PY; Chen YW; Tseng PT; Lin CH,Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30496768/,0,1,0,1,0,1
30476125,Undernutrition and Tuberculosis: Public Health Implications.,"Almost 800 million people are chronically undernourished worldwide, of whom 98% are in low- and middle-income countries where tuberculosis is endemic. In many tuberculosis-endemic countries, undernutrition is a driver of tuberculosis incidence and associated with a high population attributable fraction of tuberculosis and poor treatment outcomes. Data suggest that undernutrition impairs innate and adaptive immune responses needed to control Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and may affect responses to live vaccines, such as BCG. Given its impact on tuberculosis, addressing undernutrition will be a vital component of the World Health Organization End TB strategy. This narrative review describes the effect of undernutrition on the immune response, vaccine response, and tuberculosis incidence, severity, and treatment outcomes.",Sinha P; Davis J; Saag L; Wanke C; Salgame P; Mesick J; Horsburgh CR; Hochberg NS,The Journal of infectious diseases,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30476125/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30470232,Effects of fatty and lean fish intake on stroke risk: a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.,"Fish intake has been postulated to reduce the risk of stroke. However, whether the beneficial effect of fish are mainly linked to fat content, as a source of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, remains unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis to compare the effect of fatty and lean fish intake on stroke risk. We performed a literature search on four database (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library) through February 1, 2018 to identify prospective studies of fatty and lean fish in relation to stroke risk. A random-effects model was used to calculate the summary estimates. We identified five prospective studies, including 7 comparisons for fatty fish intake and 5 comparisons for lean fish intake. Compared with the highest category of intake with lowest category, the summary relative risk was 0.88 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.74-1.04] for fatty fish intake and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.67-0.99) for lean fish intake. No heterogeneity across studies and publication bias were observed. Our findings demonstrated that fatty and lean fish intake has beneficial effects on stroke risk, especially lean fish intake. Additional prospective studies are necessary to confirm these observations.",Qin ZZ; Xu JY; Chen GC; Ma YX; Qin LQ,Lipids in health and disease,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30470232/,0,0,0,1,0,0
30402203,Connection between Systemic Inflammation and Neuroinflammation Underlies Neuroprotective Mechanism of Several Phytochemicals in Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), and a substantial portion of elderly population at risk of these diseases requires nutritional intervention to benefit health due to lack of clinically relevant drugs. To this end, anti-inflammatory mechanisms of several phytochemicals such as curcumin, resveratrol, propolis, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and ginsenosides have been extensively studied. However, correlation of the phytochemicals with neuroinflammation or brain nutrition is not fully considered, especially in their therapeutic mechanism for neuronal damage or dysfunction. In this article, we review the advance in antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of phytochemicals and discuss the potential communication with brain microenvironment by improved gastrointestinal function, enhanced systemic immunity, and neuroprotective outcomes. These data show that phytochemicals may modulate and suppress neuroinflammation of the brain by several approaches: (1) reducing systemic inflammation and infiltration via the blood-brain barrier (BBB), (2) direct permeation into the brain parenchyma leading to neuroprotection, (3) enhancing integrity of disrupted BBB, and (4) vagal reflex-mediated nutrition and protection by gastrointestinal function signaling to the brain. Therefore, many phytochemicals have multiple potential neuroprotective approaches contributing to therapeutic benefit for pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, and development of strategies for preventing these diseases represents a considerable public health concern and socioeconomic burden.",Wang J; Song Y; Chen Z; Leng SX,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30402203/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30389231,"Hepatic growth hormone - JAK2 - STAT5 signalling: Metabolic function, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma progression.","The rising prevalence of obesity came along with an increase in associated metabolic disorders in Western countries. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome and is linked to primary stages of liver cancer development. Growth hormone (GH) regulates various vital processes such as energy supply and cellular regeneration. In addition, GH regulates various aspects of liver physiology through activating the Janus kinase (JAK) 2- signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5 pathway. Consequently, disrupted GH - JAK2 - STAT5 signaling in the liver alters hepatic lipid metabolism and is associated with NAFLD development in humans and mouse models. Interestingly, while STAT5 as well as JAK2 deficiency correlates with hepatic lipid accumulation, recent studies suggest that these proteins have unique ambivalent functions in chronic liver disease progression and tumorigenesis. In this review, we focus on the consequences of altered GH - JAK2 - STAT5 signaling for hepatic lipid metabolism and liver cancer development with an emphasis on lessons learned from genetic knockout models.",Kaltenecker D; Themanns M; Mueller KM; Spirk K; Suske T; Merkel O; Kenner L; Luís A; Kozlov A; Haybaeck J; Müller M; Han X; Moriggl R,Cytokine,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30389231/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30386297,Cognitive Effects of Aromatase and Possible Role in Memory Disorders.,"Diverse cognitive functions in many vertebrate species are influenced by local conversion of androgens to 17β-estradiol (E2) by aromatase. This enzyme is highly expressed in various brain regions across species, with some inter-species variation in terms of regional brain expression. Since women with breast cancer and men and women with other disorders are often treated with aromatase inhibitors (AI), these populations might be especially vulnerable to cognitive deficits due to low neuroE2 synthesis, i.e., synthesis of E2 directly within the brain. Animal models have been useful in deciphering aromatase effects on cognitive functions. Consequences of AI administration at various life cycle stages have been assessed on auditory, song processing, and spatial memory in birds and various aspects of cognition in rodent models. Additionally, cognitive deficits have been described in aromatase knockout (ArKO) mice that systemically lack this gene throughout their lifespan. This review will consider evidence to date that AI treatment in male and female rodent models, birds, and humans results in cognitive impairments. How brain aromatase regulates cognitive function throughout the lifespan, and gaps in current knowledge will be considered, along with future directions to better define how aromatase might guide learning and memory from early development through the geriatric period. Better understanding the importance of E2 synthesis on neurobehavioral responses at various ages will likely aid in the discovery of therapeutic strategies to prevent potential cognitive deficits, including Alzheimer's Disease, in individuals treated with AI or those possessing <i>CYP19</i> gene polymorphisms, as well as cognitive effects of normal aging that may be related to changes in brain aromatase activity.",Rosenfeld CS; Shay DA; Vieira-Potter VJ,Frontiers in endocrinology,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30386297/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30374289,Sexually Dimorphic Effects of Aromatase on Neurobehavioral Responses.,"Aromatase is the enzyme responsible for converting testosterone to estradiol. In mammals, aromatase is expressed in the testes, ovaries, brain, and other tissues. While estrogen is traditionally associated with reproduction and sexual behavior in females, our current understanding broadens this perspective to include such biological functions as metabolism and cognition. It is now well-recognized that aromatase plays a vital lifetime role in brain development and neurobehavioral function in both sexes. Thus, ongoing investigations seek to highlight potentially vital sex differences in the role of aromatase, particularly regarding its centrally mediated effects. To characterize the role of aromatase in mediating such functions, effects of aromatase inhibitor (AI) treatments on humans and animal models have been determined. Aromatase knockout (ArKO) mice that systemically lack the enzyme have also been employed. Humans possessing mutations in the gene encoding aromatase, <i>CYP19</i>, have also provided critical insight into how aromatase affects brain function in a possible sex-dependent manner. A better understanding of how AIs, used to treat breast cancer and other clinical conditions, may detrimentally affect neurobehavioral responses will likely promote development of future therapies to combat these effects. Herein, we will provide a critical review of the current knowledge of sex differences in aromatase regulation of various neurobehavioral functions. Although many species have been used to better understand the functions of aromatase, this review focuses on rodent models and humans. Critical gaps in our present understanding of this area will be considered, and important future research directions will be discussed.",Shay DA; Vieira-Potter VJ; Rosenfeld CS,Frontiers in molecular neuroscience,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30374289/,1,0,0,0,0,0

30314802,JCL roundtable: High-density lipoprotein function and reverse cholesterol transport.,"High-density lipoproteins (HDL) have been known since the 1960s to be associated with protection from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, the mechanisms of this protection are unclear. The extent to which HDL per se vs other correlated metabolic factors may mitigate atherosclerosis has been seriously questioned. In fact, new epidemiologic studies have found that in some clinical settings, very high HDL cholesterol levels correlate with increased atherosclerotic risk. Most importantly, over the past 2 decades, randomized clinical trials targeting HDL have failed to reproduce the usual epidemiologic inverse relation of HDL cholesterol to atherosclerotic events. In this roundtable discussion, we bring together 3 expert investigators working in the HDL field to elucidate questions of HDL function. One area of agreement is that reverse cholesterol transport remains a primary hypothesis for an anti-atherogenic role of HDL. Bioassays that measure cholesterol efflux capacity of HDL (or of apolipoprotein [apo] B-depleted plasma) have emerged as potentially accurate surrogates for reverse cholesterol transport. ApoA-I is the major functional apoprotein of HDL, but apoE- and apoC-III-containing subpopulations of HDL may have significant roles. Anti- and pro-inflammatory functions of various HDL particles, as well as the role of oxidative and other modifications, are gaining attention.",Cuchel M; Rohatgi A; Sacks FM; Guyton JR,Journal of clinical lipidology,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30314802/,1,0,0,0,0,0

One particular subset is the category where early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is the most common manifestation. These disorders are being increasingly appreciated although there has been minimal effort to articulate a unified approach to their diagnosis and management. This review will cover current thinking and strategies related to diagnosis and management of very early-onset IBD. There is an expanding set of monogenic causes of early-onset IBD. In many cases, the precise genetic cause dictates management. Lessons learned from the management of these monogenic conditions can sometimes be extrapolated to other refractory cases of IBD. An integrated approach to diagnosis, risk analysis, and management can include diagnostic approaches not often utilized for traditional IBD such as whole exome sequencing.

This parasite is a threat to public health. Disease often is not recognized and is inadequately managed. Herein, we analyze the status of congenital toxoplasmosis in Morocco, Colombia, the United States, and France. We identify the unique challenges faced by each nation in the implementation of optimal approaches to congenital toxoplasmosis as a public health problem. We suggest that developed and developing countries use a multipronged approach, modeling their public health management protocols after those in France. We conclude that education, screening, appropriate treatment, and the development of novel modalities will be required to intervene successfully in caring for individuals with this infection. Gestational screening has been demonstrated to be cost-effective, morbidity-sparing, and life-saving.

30228238,The Microbiome and Tuberculosis: Early Evidence for Cross Talk.,"Tuberculosis (TB) is an ancient infectious disease of humans that has been extensively studied both clinically and experimentally. Although susceptibility to <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> infection is clearly influenced by factors such as nutrition, immune status, and both mycobacterial and host genetics, the variable pathogenesis of TB in infected individuals remains poorly understood. During the past two decades, it has become clear that the microbiota-the trillion organisms that reside at mucosal surfaces within and on the body-can exert a major influence on disease outcome through its effects on host innate and adaptive immune function and metabolism. This new recognition of the potentially pleiotropic participation of the microbiome in immune responses has raised the possibility that the microbiota may influence <i>M. tuberculosis</i> infection and/or disease. Similarly, treatment of TB may alter the healthy steady-state composition and function of the microbiome, possibly affecting treatment outcome in addition to other host physiological parameters. Herein, we review emerging evidence for how the microbiota may influence the transition points in the life cycle of TB infection, including (i) resistance to initial infection, (ii) initial infection to latent tuberculosis (LTBI), (iii) LTBI to reactivated disease, and (iv) treatment to cure. A major goal of this review is to frame questions to guide future scientific and clinical studies in this largely unexplored but increasingly important area of TB research.",Namasivayam S; Sher A; Glickman MS; Wipperman MF,mBio,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30228238/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30219474,Effect of sumac (Rhus Coriaria) on blood lipids: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the prominent cause of mortality worldwide. Hypercholesterolemia is a chief risk factor for the progress of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) such as herbal interventions has received much attention in literature. Rhus Coriaria (RC) with the general name Sumac is a medicinal spice, especially in Middle Eastern countries which is well known as an anti-lipid spice. This study aimed to summarize the existing findings regarding the effect of RC on the lipid profile. In this review randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of RC on blood lipids were included. Electronic searches using the MeSH terms were conducted in the following databases: Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and The Cochrane Library. The effect of RC on serum lipid concentration were measured as standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) by the random-effects model. The initial search extracted 119 potentially relevant articles. After studying these publications, 4 were potentially eligible and retrieved in full text (four RCTs). Based on the results of the systematic review, RC has positive effects on different indices of the lipid profile including increasing Apo A-I and HDL; decreasing Apo B, Apo B/ Apo A1 ratio, total cholesterol, LDL and triglyceride. However the meta-analysis conducted on three studies on total cholesterol, HDL, LDL and triglyceride individually did not show any significant difference between intervention and control groups. No definite conclusion could be made on the effect of RC on serum blood lipids due to lack of sufficient clinical trials and variable inconsistency. Future trials with desirable designs that would eliminate the limitations in the current evidence are needed before conclusive claims can be made about the effect of RC on the lipid profile.",Akbari-Fakhrabadi M; Heshmati J; Sepidarkish M; Shidfar F,Complementary therapies in medicine,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30219474/,0,1,0,1,0,0

Eosinophilic esophagitis is an emerging clinical problem that is growing in recognition. It is characterized clinically by feeding dysfunction, dysphagia, and reflux-like symptoms. Histologically, eosinophilic esophagitis is identifiable by a dense epithelial eosinophilic infiltrate. Experimental modeling and clinical studies over the last decade have greatly improved mechanistic insights and led to improvements in clinical understanding and the assessment of therapeutic options for patients and their clinicians who manage this disease. Here, we review the clinicopathologic diagnostic criteria and our understanding of eosinophilic esophagitis as an allergic disease with genetic and immunological components. We present studies defining the importance of the epithelial barrier and the concept of barrier dysfunction as an initiating or perpetuating factor for this disease. We discuss the relationship between the symptoms of dysphagia and feeding dysfunction, our current knowledge of the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, and advances in clinical assessment of esophageal distensibility and narrowing in eosinophilic esophagitis patients.

Being malnourished at the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) leads to higher risk of early mortality and reduced quality of life. Thus, introduction of protein-energy-fortified macronutrient supplements at ART initiation may improve HIV treatment outcomes. This review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of macronutrient interventions. This systematic review and meta-analysis included 15 studies conducted from 2000 to 2015 among Sub-Saharan African adults. Six randomized controlled trials and 4 retrospective cohort studies provided data eligible for a meta-analysis. Supplementation significantly increased the overall standardized mean difference (SMD) between baseline and follow-up data in weight (SMD = 0.382, p < .001), BMI (SMD = 0.799, p < .001); fat-free mass (SMD = 0.154, p = .009); and CD4 count (SMD = 0.428, p < .001).

30101408,Epithelial-stromal crosstalk and fibrosis in eosinophilic esophagitis.,"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a food allergen-induced inflammatory disorder. EoE is increasingly recognized as a cause of swallowing dysfunction, food impaction and esophageal stricture. Inflammation of the esophageal mucosa involves immune cell infiltrate, reactive epithelial changes and fibroblast activation, culminating in robust tissue remodeling toward esophageal fibrosis characterized by excess collagen deposition in the subepithelial lamina propria. Fibrosis contributes to a unique mechanical property of the EoE-affected esophagus that is substantially stiffer than the normal esophagus. There is a great need to better understand the processes behind esophageal fibrosis in order to foster improved diagnostic tools and novel therapeutics for EoE-related esophageal fibrosis. In this review, we discuss the role of esophageal inflammatory microenvironment that promotes esophageal fibrosis, with specific emphasis upon cytokines-mediated functional epithelial-stromal interplays, recruitment and activation of a variety of effector cells, and tissue stiffness. We then explore the current state of clinical methodologies to detect and treat the EoE-related esophageal stricture.",Muir AB; Wang JX; Nakagawa H,Journal of gastroenterology,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30101408/,1,0,0,0,0,0

30009819,Updated International Consensus Diagnostic Criteria for Eosinophilic Esophagitis: Proceedings of the AGREE Conference.,"Over the last decade, clinical experiences and research studies raised concerns regarding use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) as part of the diagnostic strategy for eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). We aimed to clarify the use of PPIs in the evaluation and treatment of children and adults with suspected EoE to develop updated international consensus criteria for EoE diagnosis. A consensus conference was convened to address the issue of PPI use for esophageal eosinophilia using a process consistent with standards described in the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II. Pediatric and adult physicians and researchers from gastroenterology, allergy, and pathology subspecialties representing 14 countries used online communications, teleconferences, and a face-to-face meeting to review the literature and clinical experiences. Substantial evidence documented that PPIs reduce esophageal eosinophilia in children, adolescents, and adults, with several mechanisms potentially explaining the treatment effect. Based on these findings, an updated diagnostic algorithm for EoE was developed, with removal of the PPI trial requirement. EoE should be diagnosed when there are symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and at least 15 eosinophils per high-power field (or approximately 60 eosinophils per mm<sup>2</sup>) on esophageal biopsy and after a comprehensive assessment of non-EoE disorders that could cause or potentially contribute to esophageal eosinophilia. The evidence suggests that PPIs are better classified as a treatment for esophageal eosinophilia that may be due to EoE than as a diagnostic criterion, and we have developed updated consensus criteria for EoE that reflect this change.",Dellon ES; Liacouras CA; Molina-Infante J; Furuta GT; Spergel JM; Zevit N; Spechler SJ; Attwood SE; Straumann A; Aceves SS; Alexander JA; Atkins D; Arva NC; Blanchard C; Bonis PA; Book WM; Capocelli KE; Chehade M; Cheng E; Collins MH; Davis CM; Dias JA; Di Lorenzo C; Dohil R; Dupont C; Falk GW; Ferreira CT; Fox A; Gonsalves NP; Gupta SK; Katzka DA; Kinoshita Y; Menard-Katcher C; Kodroff E; Metz DC; Miehlke S; Muir AB; Mukkada VA; Murch S; Nurko S; Ohtsuka Y; Orel R; Papadopoulou A; Peterson KA; Philpott H; Putnam PE; Richter JE; Rosen R; Rothenberg ME; Schoepfer A; Scott MM; Shah N; Sheikh J; Souza RF; Strobel MJ; Talley NJ; Vaezi MF; Vandenplas Y; Vieira MC; Walker MM; Wechsler JB; Wershil BK; Wen T; Yang GY; Hirano I; Bredenoord AJ,Gastroenterology,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30009819/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29995221,A Variety of Alu-Mediated Copy Number Variations Can Underlie IL-12Rβ1 Deficiency.,"Inborn errors of IFN-γ immunity underlie Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD). Autosomal recessive complete IL-12Rβ1 deficiency is the most frequent genetic etiology of MSMD. Only two of the 84 known mutations are copy number variations (CNVs), identified in two of the 213 IL-12Rβ1-deficient patients and two of the 164 kindreds reported. These two CNVs are large deletions found in the heterozygous or homozygous state. We searched for novel families with IL-12Rβ1 deficiency due to CNVs. We studied six MSMD patients from five unrelated kindreds displaying adverse reactions to BCG vaccination. Three of the patients also presented systemic salmonellosis, two had mucocutaneous candidiasis, and one had disseminated histoplasmosis. We searched for CNVs and other variations by IL12RB1-targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). We identified six new IL-12Rβ1-deficient patients with a complete loss of IL-12Rβ1 expression on phytohemagglutinin-activated T cells and/or EBV-transformed B cells. The cells of these patients did not respond to IL-12 and IL-23. Five different CNVs encompassing IL12RB1 (four deletions and one duplication) were identified in these patients by NGS coverage analysis, either in the homozygous state (n = 1) or in trans (n = 4) with a single-nucleotide variation (n = 3) or a small indel (n = 1). Seven of the nine mutations are novel. Interestingly, four of the five CNVs were predicted to be driven by nearby Alu elements, as well as the two previously reported large deletions. The IL12RB1 locus is actually enriched in Alu elements (44.7%), when compared with the rest of the genome (10.5%).

29907910,Maternal breastfeeding and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children: a meta-analysis.,"Previous studies have suggested environmental factors may contribute to the risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The current meta-analysis examined (1) the difference in the duration of maternal breastfeeding between children with and without ADHD, and (2) the association between maternal breastfeeding and ADHD in children. The data of individual studies were synthesized with a random-effects model. Eleven articles were included in this meta-analysis. Children with ADHD had significantly less breastfeeding duration than controls (Hedges' g = - 0.36, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) = - 0.61 to - 0.11, p = 0.005; difference in means: - 2.44 months, 95% CIs = - 3.17 to - 1.71, p < 0.001). In addition, the rates of non-exclusive breastfeeding in children with ADHD is significantly higher in ""under 3 months"" (odds ratio (OR) = 1.90, 95% CIs = 1.45 to 2.48, p < 0.001) but lower in ""6 to 12 months"" (OR = 0.69, 95% CIs = 0.49 to 0.98, p = 0.039) and ""over 12 months"" (OR = 0.58, 95% CIs = 0.35 to 0.97, p = 0.038) than controls. Children with ADHD received significantly higher rate of exclusive breastfeeding duration ""under 3 months"" (OR = 1.51, 95% CIs = 1.20 to 1.89, p < 0.001) but lower in ""over 3 months"" (OR = 0.52, 95% CIs = 0.29 to 0.95, p = 0.033) than controls. Furthermore, an association was found between non-breastfeeding and ADHD children (adjusted OR = 3.71, 95% CI = 1.94 to 7.11, p < 0.001). Our results suggest maternal breastfeeding is associated with a lower risk of ADHD in children. Future longitudinal research is required to confirm/refute these findings and to explore possible mechanisms underlying this association.",Tseng PT; Yen CF; Chen YW; Stubbs B; Carvalho AF; Whiteley P; Chu CS; Li DJ; Chen TY; Yang WC; Tang CH; Liang HY; Yang WC; Wu CK; Lin PY,European child & adolescent psychiatry,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29907910/,0,0,0,1,0,1
29886183,Nutritional modulation of the intestinal microbiota; future opportunities for the prevention and treatment of neuroimmune and neuroinflammatory disease.,"The gut-brain axis refers to the bidirectional communication between the enteric nervous system and the central nervous system. Mounting evidence supports the premise that the intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in its function and has led to the more common and perhaps more accurate term gut-microbiota-brain axis. Numerous studies have identified associations between an altered microbiome and neuroimmune and neuroinflammatory diseases. In most cases, it is unknown if these associations are cause or effect; notwithstanding, maintaining or restoring homeostasis of the microbiota may represent future opportunities when treating or preventing these diseases. In recent years, several studies have identified the diet as a primary contributing factor in shaping the composition of the gut microbiota and, in turn, the mucosal and systemic immune systems. In this review, we will discuss the potential opportunities and challenges with respect to modifying and shaping the microbiota through diet and nutrition in order to treat or prevent neuroimmune and neuroinflammatory disease.",Lombardi VC; De Meirleir KL; Subramanian K; Nourani SM; Dagda RK; Delaney SL; Palotás A,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29886183/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29868016,Changes in Nutritional Status Impact Immune Cell Metabolism and Function.,"Immune cell function and metabolism are closely linked. Many studies have now clearly demonstrated that alterations in cellular metabolism influence immune cell function and that, conversely, immune cell function determines the cellular metabolic state. Less well understood, however, are the effects of systemic metabolism or whole organism nutritional status on immune cell function and metabolism. Several studies have demonstrated that undernutrition is associated with immunosuppression, which leads to both increased susceptibility to infection and protection against several types of autoimmune disease, whereas overnutrition is associated with low-grade, chronic inflammation that increases the risk of metabolic and cardiovascular disease, promotes autoreactivity, and disrupts protective immunity. Here, we review the effects of nutritional status on immunity and highlight the effects of nutrition on circulating cytokines and immune cell populations in both human studies and mouse models. As T cells are critical members of the immune system, which direct overall immune response, we will focus this review on the influence of systemic nutritional status on T cell metabolism and function. Several cytokines and hormones have been identified which mediate the effects of nutrition on T cell metabolism and function through the expression and action of key regulatory signaling proteins. Understanding how T cells are sensitive to both inadequate and overabundant nutrients may enhance our ability to target immune cell metabolism and alter immunity in both malnutrition and obesity.",Alwarawrah Y; Kiernan K; MacIver NJ,Frontiers in immunology,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29868016/,1,0,0,0,0,0

There is a growing recognition of a subset of patients with eosinophilic esophagitis whose disease does not respond well to topical steroids or elimination diets. In addition, long-term use of corticosteroids presents possible risks that are currently being evaluated. Systemic therapy with a biologic agent offers potential advantages as a global approach that could limit the need for multiple, locally active medical therapies and allergen avoidance. The identification of novel biologic strategies is ongoing, and the recent validation of instruments and outcome measures to assess disease activity has proved essential in demonstrating efficacy.

The disorders are suspected to result from an abnormal inflammatory response to allergen (s), and individuals may develop a relapsing or chronic disease, if the allergen is not eliminated. Mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, including the humoral immune response, need to be fully elucidated. A variety of therapies are used, although there is a lack of well-defined randomized, prospective studies. Other therapeutic options are needed as the current treatments have potential concerns; elimination diets may impair a child's quality of life, and corticosteroids have adverse risks with long-term use.

29848130,Emerging drugs for eosinophilic esophagitis.,"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is rare but incidence and prevalence is increasing. EoE is characterized by eosinophilic inflammation of the esophagus causing gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, reflux, dysphagia, and food impactions. If untreated, remodeling and fibrosis of the esophagus can occur and stricture formation may result. Current treatment options are limited to food-restriction diets or medications including proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or swallowed corticosteroids. Significant progress has been made in understanding the underlying mechanisms of EoE allowing for development of drugs that target specific points in EoE pathways. Investigation of these drugs is early with few controlled studies, but many show promise as future treatments. Areas covered: This review will provide an up to date discussion of current therapies and investigational drugs for EoE. Articles used in this review were retrieved from PubMed. Ongoing or completed clinical trials were obtained through clinicaltrials.gov and review of the PharmaProjects database. Expert Opinion: Multiple therapeutic targets have been identified and several have shown efficacy. Work is needed to define appropriate trial outcome measures. Collaboration between government agencies, patient advocacy groups, and investigator-led consortia is critical for completing new clinical trials which should pave the way for new therapies in clinical practice.",Pesek RD; Gupta SK,Expert opinion on emerging drugs,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29848130/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29729305,Environmental factors and eosinophilic esophagitis.,"The incidence and prevalence of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) have markedly increased over the past 2 decades, outpacing increased detection of the disease. Although genetic susceptibility markers for EoE have begun to be elucidated, the rate at which EoE has increased in incidence suggests environmental factors predominate. Despite many advances in understanding of the pathogenesis of EoE, the cause of EoE is unknown. This article reviews the emerging data related to environmental risk factors for EoE. Many of these environmental factors are rooted in the theoretical framework of the hygiene hypothesis, specifically mediation of disease development through dysbiosis. Other hypotheses are based on associations that have been observed in studies of non-EoE allergic disease. We describe the evidence that early-life exposures, including antibiotic use, acid suppression, and cesarean delivery, can increase the risk of disease. We also describe the evidence that infectious agents, such as Helicobacter pylori, are inversely associated with disease. Current evidence on geographic risk factors, such as population density, climate zone, and seasonality, is reviewed. We also describe behavioral factors that have been evaluated. Limitations of the existing research are discussed, and recommendations for future areas of research, including assessment of gene-environment interaction, are presented.",Jensen ET; Dellon ES,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29729305/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29728695,Implications of STAT3 and STAT5 signaling on gene regulation and chromatin remodeling in hematopoietic cancer.,"STAT3 and STAT5 proteins are oncogenic downstream mediators of the JAK-STAT pathway. Deregulated STAT3 and STAT5 signaling promotes cancer cell proliferation and survival in conjunction with other core cancer pathways. Nuclear phosphorylated STAT3 and STAT5 regulate cell-type-specific transcription profiles via binding to promoter elements and exert more complex functions involving interaction with various transcriptional coactivators or corepressors and chromatin remodeling proteins. The JAK-STAT pathway can rapidly reshape the chromatin landscape upon cytokine, hormone, or growth factor stimulation and unphosphorylated STAT proteins also appear to be functional with respect to regulating chromatin accessibility. Notably, cancer genome landscape studies have implicated mutations in various epigenetic modifiers as well as the JAK-STAT pathway as underlying causes of many cancers, particularly acute leukemia and lymphomas. However, it is incompletely understood how mutations within these pathways can interact and synergize to promote cancer. We summarize the current knowledge of oncogenic STAT3 and STAT5 functions downstream of cytokine signaling and provide details on prerequisites for DNA binding and gene transcription. We also discuss key interactions of STAT3 and STAT5 with chromatin remodeling factors such as DNA methyltransferases, histone modifiers, cofactors, corepressors, and other transcription factors.",Wingelhofer B; Neubauer HA; Valent P; Han X; Constantinescu SN; Gunning PT; Müller M; Moriggl R,Leukemia,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29728695/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29713660,Esophageal 3D Culture Systems as Modeling Tools in Esophageal Epithelial Pathobiology and Personalized Medicine.,"The stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus shows a proliferative basal layer of keratinocytes that undergo terminal differentiation in overlying suprabasal layers. Esophageal pathologies, including eosinophilic esophagitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, Barrett's esophagus, squamous cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma, cause perturbations in the esophageal epithelial proliferation-differentiation gradient. Three-dimensional (3D) culture platforms mimicking in vivo esophageal epithelial tissue architecture ex vivo have emerged as powerful experimental tools for the investigation of esophageal biology in the context of homeostasis and pathology. Herein, we describe types of 3D culture that are used to model the esophagus, including organotypic, organoid, and spheroid culture systems. We discuss the development and optimization of various esophageal 3D culture models; highlight the applications, strengths, and limitations of each method; and summarize how these models have been used to evaluate the esophagus under homeostatic conditions as well as under the duress of inflammation and precancerous/cancerous conditions. Finally, we present future perspectives regarding the use of esophageal 3D models in basic science research as well as translational studies with the potential for personalized medicine.",Whelan KA; Muir AB; Nakagawa H,Cellular and molecular gastroenterology and hepatology,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29713660/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29623873,Antimicrobial Resistance in <i>Campylobacter</i> spp.,"<i>Campylobacter</i> is a major foodborne pathogen and has become increasingly resistant to clinically important antimicrobials. To cope with the selection pressure from antimicrobial use in both veterinary and human medicine, <i>Campylobacter</i> has developed multiple mechanisms for antibiotic resistance, including modification or mutation of antimicrobial targets, modification or inactivation of antibiotics, and reduced drug accumulation by drug efflux pumps. Some of these mechanisms confer resistance to a specific class of antimicrobials, while others give rise to multidrug resistance. Notably, new antibiotic resistance mechanisms continuously emerge in <i>Campylobacter</i>, and some examples include the recently discovered multidrug resistance genomic islands harboring multiple genes involved in the resistance to aminoglycosides and macrolides, a novel Cfr(C) conferring resistance to phenicols and other drugs, and a potent multidrug efflux pump CmeABC variant (RE-CmeABC) that shows a significantly enhanced function in multidrug resistance and is associated with exceedingly high-level resistance to fluoroquinolones. These newly emerged resistance mechanisms are horizontally transferable and greatly facilitate the adaptation of <i>Campylobacter</i> in the food-producing environments where antibiotics are frequently used. In this article, we will discuss how <i>Campylobacter</i> resists the action of various classes of antimicrobials, with an emphasis on newly discovered mechanisms.",Shen Z; Wang Y; Zhang Q; Shen J,Microbiology spectrum,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29623873/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29601355,How to prevent food allergy during infancy: what has changed since 2013?,"The purpose of this review is to summarize recent studies and emerging consensus guidelines regarding food allergy prevention in infants of the past 5 years. Prior to 2013, the general consensus regarding prevention of food allergy in infants was to recommend delayed introduction or complete avoidance of commonly allergenic foods, such as milk, egg and peanut. However, in the past 5 years, several landmark studies have been conducted, particularly with peanut. The results of these studies have led to a paradigm shift from recommending delayed introduction to early introduction and frequent feeding of highly allergenic foods such as peanut, with hopes of achieving primary and secondary prevention of food allergy in infants. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that early introduction and frequent feeding, rather than delayed introduction or complete avoidance, of commonly allergenic foods plays a critical role in preventing food allergy in infants. More studies are required to risk-stratify infants by personal and family atopic history to tailor guidelines for groups with inherently different risks. The universal acceptance of the guidelines and their application outcome are still to be determined.",Lavery WJ; Assa'ad A,Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29601355/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29589132,Smoking quantity determines disease activity and function in Chinese patients with ankylosing spondylitis.,"The objective of this study was to systemically and comprehensively evaluate the associations between smoking and disease outcomes in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Information on smoking, clinical features, and sociodemographic characteristics was collected by a questionnaire administered directly to the patient. Group differences were analyzed by t test or chi-square test. Logistic regression analysis was conducted with the Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Bath AS Functional Index (BASFI), C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate as the dependent variables and different stratification of smoking duration, smoking intensity, and cumulative smoking as independent variables. In order to compare our results with previous studies, meta-analysis was performed to calculate standardized mean difference (SMD) for relationship between outcomes and smoking status. A total of 1178 AS patients were analyzed. Compared with non-smokers, the risk of having active disease (BASDAI ≥ 4) was higher in patients who smoked at least 15 years, or 15 cigarettes per day, or 15 pack-years (OR = 1.70 [1.06, 2.73], 1.75 [1.08, 2.82], and 1.97 [1.06, 3.67], respectively); and smokers had increasing risk of BASDAI ≥ 4 with increasing years of smoking, or cigarettes per day, or pack-years (p<sub>-trend</sub> = 0.010, 0.008 and 0.006, respectively). The risk of having active disease was higher in patients who smoked at least 15 cigarettes per day or 15 pack-years (OR = 1.74 [1.06, 2.84] and 2.89 [1.56, 5.35], respectively), with increasing number of cigarettes per day and pack-years. Smokers had an increased risk of BASFI ≥ 4 (p<sub>-trend</sub> = 0.040 and 0.007, respectively). By meta-analysis, current, former and ever smokers had significantly higher BASDAI (SMD = 0.34 [0.18, 0.48], 0.10 [0.01, 0.19], and 0.27 [0.20, 0.34], respectively) and BASFI (SMD = 0.35 [0.16, 0.55], 0.30 [0.22, 0.39], and 0.35 [0.21, 0.50], respectively) compared to non-smokers. Smoking is a risk factor for greater disease activity and worse functioning in AS patients.",Zhang H; Wan W; Liu J; Dai S; Zou Y; Qian Q; Ding Y; Xu X; Ji H; He H; Zhu Q; Yang C; Ye S; Jiang L; Tang J; Tong Q; He D; Zhao D; Li Y; Ma Y; Zhou J; Mei Z; Chen X; Yuan Z; Zhang J; Wang X; Yang Y; Jin L; Gao Y; Zhou X; Reveille JD; Zou H; Wang J,Clinical rheumatology,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29589132/,0,0,0,1,0,0
29572552,Dietary carbohydrates: a review of international recommendations and the methods used to derive them.,"Renewed dietary recommendations for carbohydrates have recently been published by various international health authorities. The present work (1) reviews the methods and processes (systematic approach/review, inclusion of public consultation) used to identify, select and grade the evidence underpinning the recommendations, particularly for total carbohydrate (CHO), fibre and sugar consumption, and (2) examines the extent to which variation in the methods and processes applied relates to any differences in the final recommendations. A search of WHO, US, Canada, Australia and European sources identified 19 documents from 13 authorities with the desired detailed information. Processes and methods applied to derive recommendations were compiled and compared. (1) A relatively high total CHO and fibre intake and limited intake of (added or free) sugars are generally recommended. (2) Even where recommendations are similar, the specific justifications for quantitative/qualitative recommendations differ across authorities. (3) Differences in recommendations mainly arise from differences in the underlying definitions of CHO exposure and classifications, the degree to which specific CHO-providing foods and food components were considered, and the choice and number of health outcomes selected. (4) Differences in the selection of source material, time frames or data aggregation and grading methods appeared to have minor influence. Despite general consistency, apparent differences among the recommendations of different authorities would likely be minimized by: (1) More explicit quantitative justifications for numerical recommendations and communication of uncertainty, and (2) greater international harmonization, particularly in the underlying definitions of exposures and range of relevant nutrition-related outcomes.",Buyken AE; Mela DJ; Dussort P; Johnson IT; Macdonald IA; Stowell JD; Brouns FJPH,European journal of clinical nutrition,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29572552/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29569377,Immune regulation by microbiome metabolites.,"Commensal microbes and the host immune system have been co-evolved for mutual regulation. Microbes regulate the host immune system, in part, by producing metabolites. A mounting body of evidence indicates that diverse microbial metabolites profoundly regulate the immune system via host receptors and other target molecules. Immune cells express metabolite-specific receptors such as P2X<sub>7</sub> , GPR41, GPR43, GPR109A, aryl hydrocarbon receptor precursor (AhR), pregnane X receptor (PXR), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), TGR5 and other molecular targets. Microbial metabolites and their receptors form an extensive array of signals to respond to changes in nutrition, health and immunological status. As a consequence, microbial metabolite signals contribute to nutrient harvest from diet, and regulate host metabolism and the immune system. Importantly, microbial metabolites bidirectionally function to promote both tolerance and immunity to effectively fight infection without developing inflammatory diseases. In pathogenic conditions, adverse effects of microbial metabolites have been observed as well. Key immune-regulatory functions of the metabolites, generated from carbohydrates, proteins and bile acids, are reviewed in this article.",Kim CH,Immunology,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29569377/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29540271,Peripheral iron levels in children with autism spectrum disorders vs controls: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder, and nutritional deficiency may play a role in the development of ASD. A relationship between ASD and iron levels/iron deficiency (ID) has been reported; however, the results have been inconsistent. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to examine the relationship between ASD and ID following the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. We performed a systematic search of PubMed, ScienceDirect, Embase, ProQuest, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases up to September 22, 2017. Studies providing data on peripheral iron levels and/or the prevalence of ID in children with ASD vs those without ASD (non-ASD) were included. Primary outcomes included the difference in peripheral iron levels in children with ASD compared with those without ASD, and the odds ratio of ASD in children with ID compared with those without ID. Twenty-five articles met the inclusion criteria. We found that peripheral iron levels were not significantly different between the ASD and non-ASD groups, including serum ferritin (k = 4, Hedges g = 0.016, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.482 to 0.515, P = .949) or hair iron (k = 12; Hedges g = -0.219, 95% CI = -0.551 to 0.113, P = .196). There was no significant difference in the amount of iron in food content between the ASD and non-ASD groups (k = 6; Hedges g = -0.458, 95% CI = -1.246 to 0.330, P = .254). However, the reciprocal comorbidity of ASD and ID was significantly higher than in the children without these disorders. Our analysis showed that the available evidence is inconsistent with regard to whether children with ASD have lower iron levels. Future longitudinal studies are required to confirm or refute these associations and elucidate potential mechanisms.",Tseng PT; Cheng YS; Chen YW; Stubbs B; Whiteley P; Carvalho AF; Li DJ; Chen TY; Yang WC; Tang CH; Chu CS; Yang WC; Liang HY; Wu CK; Yen CF; Lin PY,"Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)",2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29540271/,0,1,0,1,0,1
29537884,Current status of sperm functional genomics and its diagnostic potential of fertility in bovine (Bos taurus).,"With artificial insemination (AI) and other precision dependent assisted reproductive technologies (ART) being followed in large scale in human and animal reproduction, assessing semen quality and fertilizability is under continuous scrutiny. Various tests have been developed to predict semen quality, but so far no single, highly reliable test is available. In this regard, transcriptomic profiling of spermatozoa assumes significance as it carries the information about spermatogenesis, sperm function, and paternal roles in post-fertilization events. Human spermatozoal transcriptome profiling has been carried out on a large number of individuals to predict the semen quality. A study in human indicated that the outcome of some idiopathic couples seeking reproductive care could be helped using transcriptomic profiling of spermatozoa. Such studies have a direct impact on the bovine dairy industry, wherein AI is practiced. Limited studies in bovine spermatozoal transcriptome profiling have revealed that the spermatozoa contain various classes of RNA, like in human. Approximately 13,000 bovine genes yield a series of spermatozoal transcripts, of which most are fragmented in nature. Their abundance is indicative of the timing of events associated with spermatogenesis, e.g., PRM1, IGF1, BMP2; sperm function, TSSK6, CRISP, HSFY2; fertility, UBE2D3, Integrin-β, LDC-1; and embryonic development, miR34c-5p, BCL2L11, BRCA1. The most abundant translated bovine transcripts are BSP3 and SPATA18, and are involved in regulation of germ cell development and the maintenance of chromatin integrity during spermatogenesis respectively. The presence of transcripts associated with placental development, e.g., placental associated glycoproteins (PAGs) have suggested their possible influence beyond early embryonic development. Changes in transcript levels like RPL31 and PRKCE that increase, and PRM1 that decreases, during cryopreservation need to be defined in order to optimize cryopreservation and fertility yield. Spermatozoal transcriptome profiling with validation studies are warranted in large numbers of animals to elucidate their significance for selecting fertile bulls for the breeding program.

29528874,High-Density Lipoprotein Functionality as a New Pharmacological Target on Cardiovascular Disease: Unifying Mechanism That Explains High-Density Lipoprotein Protection Toward the Progression of Atherosclerosis.,"The formation of the atherosclerotic plaque that is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal amounts of cholesterol-loaded macrophages in the artery wall is mediated by both inflammatory events and alterations of lipid/lipoprotein metabolism. Reverse transport of cholesterol opposes the formation and development of atherosclerotic plaque by promoting high density lipoprotein (HDL)-mediated removal of cholesterol from peripheral macrophages and its delivery back to the liver for excretion into the bile. Although an inverse association between HDL plasma levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been demonstrated over the years, several studies have recently shown that the antiatherogenic functions of HDL seem to be mediated by their functionality, not always associated with their plasma concentrations. Therefore, assessment of HDL function, evaluated as the capacity to promote cell cholesterol efflux, may offer a better prediction of CVD than HDL levels alone. In agreement with this idea, it has recently been shown that the assessment of serum cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC), as a metric of HDL functionality, may represent a predictor of atherosclerosis extent in humans. The purpose of this narrative review is to summarize the current evidence concerning the role of cholesterol efflux capacity that is important for evaluating CVD risk, focusing on pharmacological evidences and its relationship with inflammation. We conclude that HDL therapeutics are a promising area of investigation but strategies for identifying efficacy must move beyond the idea of simply raising static HDL-cholesterol levels and toward methods of measuring the dynamics of HDL particle remodeling and the generation of lipid-free apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). In this way, apoA-I, unlike mature HDL, can promote the greatest extent of cholesterol efflux relieving cellular cholesterol toxicity and the inflammation it causes.",Favari E; Thomas MJ; Sorci-Thomas MG,Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29528874/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The pathophysiology of IFALD is poorly understood but appears to be multifactorial and related to the inflammatory state in the patient with IF. Visceral transplant for IFALD includes variants of intestine, liver, or combined liver-intestine allografts. Graft selection for an individual patient depends on the etiology of IF, abdominal and vascular anatomy, severity of IFALD, and potential for intestinal rehabilitation. The past decade has witnessed dramatic improvement in the management of IFALD, principally due to improved lipid emulsion formulations and the multidisciplinary care of the patient with IF.

However, 1.0 mg F/L, initially called a permissible level, was adopted for fluoridation programs. McClure, in 1943, derived an ""optimum"" fluoride intake based on this permissible concentration. It was not until 1944 that Dean referred to this concentration as the ""optimal"" concentration. These were critical steps that have informed health authorities through to today. Several countries have derived toxicological estimates of an adequate and an upper level of intake of fluoride as an important nutrient. The US Institute of Medicine (IOM) in 1997 estimated an Adequate Intake (AI) of 0.05 mg F/kg bodyweight (bw)/d and a Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) of 0.10 mg F/kg bw/d. These have been widely promulgated. However, a conundrum has existed with estimates of actual fluoride intake that exceed the UL without the expected adverse fluorosis effects being observed. Both the AI and UL need review. Fluoride intake at an individual level should be interpreted to inform more nuanced guidelines for individual behavior. An ""optimum"" intake should be based on community perceptions of caries and fluorosis, while the ultimate test for fluoride intake is monitoring caries and fluorosis in populations.",Spencer AJ; Do LG; Mueller U; Baines J; Foley M; Peres MA,Advances in dental research,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29461108/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29412180,As You Eat It: Effects of Prenatal Nutrition on Asthma.,"Asthma most frequently develops early in life, and increased recognition of the role of lifestyle and environmental factors in asthma susceptibility raises the possibility that dietary exposures during pregnancy may influence the risk of asthma in offspring. This review discusses the latest evidence with regard to the effect of diet during pregnancy on childhood asthma risk, including potential mechanisms, outcomes of randomized clinical trials, and results from observational studies. Vitamin D and polyunsaturated fatty acid intake during pregnancy are highlighted as areas with large and growing bodies of literature to support a potential role in prenatal modulation of subsequent asthma risk. Several other nutritional interventions are under active investigation, and recommendations regarding dietary modifications during pregnancy will likely need to be personalized based on factors such as maternal smoking and genetic variants. Although nutrition during pregnancy is uniquely challenging to investigate, and definitive recommendations cannot be made without additional high-quality evidence and knowledge regarding long-term effects of interventions, the modifiable nature of the diet and sizeable potential reduction of morbidity supports ongoing research to determine how to optimize nutrition during pregnancy to prevent asthma in offspring.",Lee-Sarwar K; Litonjua AA,The journal of allergy and clinical immunology.

29400994,Advances in Understanding the Molecular Basis of the Mediterranean Diet Effect.,"Increasingly, studies showing the protective effects of the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) on different diseases (cardiovascular, diabetes, some cancers, and even total mortality and aging indicators) are being published. The scientific evidence level for each outcome is variable, and new studies are needed to better understand the molecular mechanisms whereby the MedDiet may exercise its effects. Here, we present recent advances in understanding the molecular basis of MedDiet effects, mainly focusing on cardiovascular diseases but also discussing other related diseases. There is heterogeneity in defining the MedDiet, and it can, owing to its complexity, be considered as an exposome with thousands of nutrients and phytochemicals. We review MedDiet composition and assessment as well as the latest advances in the genomic, epigenomic (DNA methylation, histone modifications, microRNAs, and other emerging regulators), transcriptomic (selected genes and whole transcriptome), and metabolomic and metagenomic aspects of the MedDiet effects (as a whole and for its most typical food components). We also present a critical review of the limitations of the studies undertaken and propose new analyses and greater bioinformatic integration to better understand the most important molecular mechanisms whereby the MedDiet as a whole, or its main food components, may exercise their protective effects.",Corella D; Coltell O; Macian F; Ordovás JM,Annual review of food science and technology,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29400994/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29371248,From High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol to Measurements of Function: Prospects for the Development of Tests for High-Density Lipoprotein Functionality in Cardiovascular Disease.,"The evidence is strong that biological functions contained in high-density lipoproteins (HDL) are antiatherogenic. These functions may track with HDL cholesterol or apolipoprotein A1 concentration to explain the strongly inverse risk curve for cardiovascular disease. Moreover, there are harmful as well as protective HDL subspecies in regard to cardiovascular disease, which could be responsible for paradoxical responses to HDL-directed treatments. Recent metabolic studies show that apolipoprotein A1-containing HDL is secreted into the circulation as mostly spherical cholesterol ester-rich lipoproteins that span the HDL size range. Most of the flux of apolipoprotein A1 HDL into and out of the circulation occurs in these spherical cholesterol-replete particles. Discoidal cholesterol-poor HDL comprises a minority of HDL secretion. We propose that much cholesterol in reverse cholesterol transport enters and exits medium and large size HDL without changing a size category, and its flux may be estimated provisionally from holoparticle clearance of cholesterol ester-rich HDL. An accurate framework for metabolism of HDL is essential to finding steady-state biomarkers that reflect HDL function in vivo. Whereas cholesterol efflux from cells to mainly discoidal HDL, mediated by ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA1), predicts cardiovascular disease, cholesterol transfers to spherical HDL also can be measured and may be relevant to protection against atherosclerosis. We propose several investigative paths on which human HDL biology may be investigated leading to convenient biomarkers of HDL quality and function having potential not only to improve risk prediction but also to more accurately target drug treatments.",Sacks FM; Jensen MK,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29371248/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29362479,Molecular mechanisms of cell death: recommendations of the Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death 2018.,"Over the past decade, the Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death (NCCD) has formulated guidelines for the definition and interpretation of cell death from morphological, biochemical, and functional perspectives. Since the field continues to expand and novel mechanisms that orchestrate multiple cell death pathways are unveiled, we propose an updated classification of cell death subroutines focusing on mechanistic and essential (as opposed to correlative and dispensable) aspects of the process. As we provide molecularly oriented definitions of terms including intrinsic apoptosis, extrinsic apoptosis, mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT)-driven necrosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, parthanatos, entotic cell death, NETotic cell death, lysosome-dependent cell death, autophagy-dependent cell death, immunogenic cell death, cellular senescence, and mitotic catastrophe, we discuss the utility of neologisms that refer to highly specialized instances of these processes.

This brief historical account starts with descriptions of the disease and its impact on human health from ancient time to the present. Our story of the bacterium starts just before the identification of the dysentery bacillus by Kiyoshi Shiga in 1898 and follows the scientific discoveries and principal scientists who contributed to the elucidation of <i>Shigella</i> pathogenesis in the first 100 years. Over the past century, <i>Shigella</i> has proved to be an outstanding model of an invasive bacterial pathogen and has served as a paradigm for the study of other bacterial pathogens. In addition to invasion of epithelial cells, some of those shared virulence traits include toxin production, multiple-antibiotic resistance, virulence genes encoded on plasmids and bacteriophages, global regulation of virulence genes, pathogenicity islands, intracellular motility, remodeling of host cytoskeleton, inflammation/polymorphonuclear leukocyte signaling, apoptosis induction/inhibition, and ""black holes"" and antivirulence genes.

29278406,Dietary Fiber and Metabolic Syndrome: A Meta-Analysis and Review of Related Mechanisms.,"(1) Background: Dietary fiber intake may provide beneficial effects on the components of metabolic syndrome (MetS); however, observational studies reported inconsistent results for the relationship between dietary fiber intake and MetS risk. We conducted a meta-analysis to quantify previous observational studies and a narrative review to summarize mechanisms involved in the potential relationship. (2) Methods: The literature was searched on PubMed and Web of Science until 28 November 2017. A random-effects model was used to calculate the summary risk estimates. Eleven cross-sectional studies and three cohort studies were included in the meta-analysis. Results from the original studies were reported as odds ratios (ORs) or relative ratios (RRs) of the MetS associated with different levels of dietary fiber intake, and the ORs/RRs comparing the highest with lowest categories of the intake were pooled. (3) Results: For the cross-sectional studies, the pooled OR was 0.70 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.61-0.82) with evidence of high heterogeneity (<i>I</i>² = 74.4%, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and publication bias (<i>p</i> for Egger's test < 0.001). After removing four studies, results remained significant (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.58-0.78) and the heterogeneity was largely reduced (<i>I</i>² = 32.4%, <i>p</i> = 0.181). For the cohort studies, the pooled RR was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.70-1.06). (4) Conclusion: Although the meta-analysis suggests an inverse association between dietary fiber intake and risk of MetS, and the association was supported by a wide range of mechanism studies, the findings are limited by insufficient cohort data. More prospective studies are needed to further verify the association between dietary fiber intake and the risk of MetS.",Chen JP; Chen GC; Wang XP; Qin L; Bai Y,Nutrients,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29278406/,1,0,0,1,0,0
29277155,WNT Takes Two to Tango: Molecular Links between the Circadian Clock and the Cell Cycle in Adult Stem Cells.,"Like two dancers, the circadian clock and cell cycle are biological oscillators engaged in bidirectional communication, resulting in circadian clock-gated cell division cycles in species ranging from cyanobacteria to mammals. The identified mechanisms for this phenomenon have expanded beyond intracellular molecular coupling components to include intercellular connections. However, detailed molecular mechanisms, dynamics, and physiological functions of the circadian clock and cell cycle as coupled oscillators remain largely unknown. In this review, we discuss current understanding of this connection in light of recent findings that have uncovered intercellular coupling between the circadian clock in Paneth cells and the cell cycle in intestinal stem cells via WNT signaling. This extends the impact of circadian rhythms regulating the timing of cell divisions beyond the intracellular domain of homogenous cell populations into dynamic, multicellular systems. In-depth understanding of the molecular links and dynamics of these two oscillators will identify potential targets and temporal regimens for effective chronotherapy.",Matsu-Ura T; Moore SR; Hong CI,Journal of biological rhythms,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29277155/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29270819,Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis Endotypes: Are We Closer to Predicting Treatment Response?,"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, food antigen-driven gastrointestinal disease that is characterized by esophageal eosinophilia. Currently, there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments for EoE, but the two most commonly prescribed therapies include topical corticosteroids and food elimination diets. Clinical trials have revealed a significant proportion of cases that are resistant to topical corticosteroids, and although we define EoE as a food antigen-driven disease, not all patients with EoE respond to elimination diets or even elemental diets. The varied response to treatments highlights the heterogeneity of EoE and the need for new treatment strategies. Despite the clinical differences in treatment response, predicting the outcome remains difficult since factors including age, histologic severity at diagnosis, atopic history, and anthropometrics are not predictive of treatment response. In our practice at an academic pediatric referral center, we observe distinct clinical EoE phenotypes, including cases with atopy, connective tissue disorders, or responsiveness to a proton pump inhibitor. Similar to the work in progress with asthma, stratification of patients with EoE by clinical phenotypes and/or molecular endotypes will likely assist with therapy selection and prediction of natural history. Molecular analysis with gene expression panels also shows promise in helping us classify patients based on molecular endotypes. In additional to the clinical and molecular classifications, more accurate histologic diagnostic criteria for EoE may help us tease out small differences between patient cohorts. Despite the leaps in knowledge over the past decade regarding EoE pathogenesis, it remains a challenge to predict the response to treatment. Future studies focused on molecular, genetic, and immunologic analyses of larger patient cohorts are needed to assist in identifying EoE phenotypes and endotypes as we attempt to improve patient outcomes in pediatric EoE.",Ferguson AE; Mukkada VA; Fulkerson PC,Clinical reviews in allergy & immunology,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29270819/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29206649,The importance of the microbiome in pediatrics and pediatric infectious diseases.,"Emerging research on the pediatric microbiome implicates the importance of the microbiome on the development of the immune system, nervous system, and growth. Changes to the microbiome during infancy are associated with the development of chronic illnesses such as asthma and inflammatory bowel disease. Additionally, the microbiome provides protection against certain pathogens, affects vaccine responses, and alters drug metabolism. This review highlights what is known about the microbiome, the establishment of a healthy microbiome and the significance that changes to the microbiome composition have on growth and health of children and adolescents. Vaginal delivery, breastfeeding, maternal health, and nutrition help shape a healthy microbiome. Caesarian delivery, formula feeding, and antibiotic use perturb the microbiome and are associated with the development of type II diabetes, asthma, allergic diseases, and obesity later in life. Specific interventions using pre and probiotics in multiple settings are under investigation with limited success. A better understanding of the microbiome and the interaction with the immune system may help guide interventions to alter the microbiome toward a state of lifelong health.",Gaufin T; Tobin NH; Aldrovandi GM,Current opinion in pediatrics,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29206649/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29187673,Dietary interventions to prevent and manage diabetes in worksite settings: a meta-analysis.,"The translation of lifestyle intervention to improve glucose tolerance into the workplace has been rare. The objective of this meta-analysis is to summarize the evidence for the effectiveness of dietary interventions in worksite settings on lowering blood sugar levels. We searched for studies in PubMed, Embase, Econlit, Ovid, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. Search terms were as follows: (1) Exposure-based: nutrition/diet/dietary intervention/health promotion/primary prevention/health behavior/health education/food /program evaluation; (2) Outcome-based: diabetes/hyperglycemia/glucose/HbA1c/glycated hemoglobin; and (3) Setting-based: workplace/worksite/occupational/industry/job/employee. We manually searched review articles and reference lists of articles identified from 1969 to December 2016. We tested for between-studies heterogeneity and calculated the pooled effect sizes for changes in HbA1c (%) and fasting glucose (mg/dl) using random effect models for meta-analysis in 2016. A total of 17 articles out of 1663 initially selected articles were included in the meta-analysis. With a random-effects model, worksite dietary interventions led to a pooled -0.18% (95% CI, -0.29 to -0.06; P<0.001) difference in HbA1c. With the random-effects model, the interventions resulted in 2.60 mg/dl lower fasting glucose with borderline significance (95% CI: -5.27 to 0.08, P=0.06). In the multivariate meta-regression model, the interventions with high percent of female participants and that used the intervention directly delivered to individuals, rather the environment changes, were associated with more effective interventions. Workplace dietary interventions can improve HbA1c. The effects were larger for the interventions with greater number of female participants and with individual-level interventions.",Shrestha A; Karmacharya BM; Khudyakov P; Weber MB; Spiegelman D,Journal of occupational health,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29187673/,1,0,0,1,0,0

29084893,What Is a Host? Attributes of Individual Susceptibility.,"In every epidemic some individuals become sick and some may die, whereas others recover from illness and still others show no signs or symptoms of disease. These differences highlight a fundamental question of microbial pathogenesis: why are some individuals susceptible to infectious diseases while others who acquire the same microbe remain well? For most of human history, the answer assumed the hand of providence. With the advent of the germ theory of disease, the focus on disease causality became the microbe, but this did not explain how there can be different outcomes of infection in different individuals with the same microbe. Here we examine the attributes of susceptibility in the context of the ""damage-response framework"" of microbial pathogenesis. We identify 11 attributes that, although not independent, are sufficiently distinct to be considered separately: microbiome, inoculum, sex, temperature, environment, age, chance, history, immunity, nutrition, and genetics. We use the first letter of each to create the mnemonic MISTEACHING, underscoring the need for caution in accepting dogma and attributing disease causality to any single factor. For both populations and individuals, variations in the attributes that assemble into MISTEACHING can create an enormity of combinations that can in turn translate into different outcomes of host-microbe encounters. Combinatorial diversity among the 11 attributes makes identifying ""signatures"" of susceptibility possible. However, with their inevitable uncertainties and propensity to change, there may still be a low likelihood for prediction with regard to individual host-microbe interactions, although probabilistic prediction may be possible.",Casadevall A; Pirofski LA,Infection and immunity,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29084893/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29077507,Multiethnic Meta-Analysis Identifies RAI1 as a Possible Obstructive Sleep Apnea-related Quantitative Trait Locus in Men.,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common heritable disorder displaying marked sexual dimorphism in disease prevalence and progression. Previous genetic association studies have identified a few genetic loci associated with OSA and related quantitative traits, but they have only focused on single ethnic groups, and a large proportion of the heritability remains unexplained. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is a commonly used quantitative measure characterizing OSA severity. Because OSA differs by sex, and the pathophysiology of obstructive events differ in rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep, we hypothesized that additional genetic association signals would be identified by analyzing the NREM/REM-specific AHI and by conducting sex-specific analyses in multiethnic samples. We performed genome-wide association tests for up to 19,733 participants of African, Asian, European, and Hispanic/Latino American ancestry in 7 studies. We identified rs12936587 on chromosome 17 as a possible quantitative trait locus for NREM AHI in men (N = 6,737; P = 1.7 × 10<sup>-8</sup>) but not in women (P = 0.77). The association with NREM AHI was replicated in a physiological research study (N = 67; P = 0.047). This locus overlapping the RAI1 gene and encompassing genes PEMT1, SREBF1, and RASD1 was previously reported to be associated with coronary artery disease, lipid metabolism, and implicated in Potocki-Lupski syndrome and Smith-Magenis syndrome, which are characterized by abnormal sleep phenotypes. We also identified gene-by-sex interactions in suggestive association regions, suggesting that genetic variants for AHI appear to vary by sex, consistent with the clinical observations of strong sexual dimorphism.",Chen H; Cade BE; Gleason KJ; Bjonnes AC; Stilp AM; Sofer T; Conomos MP; Ancoli-Israel S; Arens R; Azarbarzin A; Bell GI; Below JE; Chun S; Evans DS; Ewert R; Frazier-Wood AC; Gharib SA; Haba-Rubio J; Hagen EW; Heinzer R; Hillman DR; Johnson WC; Kutalik Z; Lane JM; Larkin EK; Lee SK; Liang J; Loredo JS; Mukherjee S; Palmer LJ; Papanicolaou GJ; Penzel T; Peppard PE; Post WS; Ramos AR; Rice K; Rotter JI; Sands SA; Shah NA; Shin C; Stone KL; Stubbe B; Sul JH; Tafti M; Taylor KD; Teumer A; Thornton TA; Tranah GJ; Wang C; Wang H; Warby SC; Wellman DA; Zee PC; Hanis CL; Laurie CC; Gottlieb DJ; Patel SR; Zhu X; Sunyaev SR; Saxena R; Lin X; Redline S,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29077507/,0,0,0,1,0,0
29026445,Viral communities of the human gut: metagenomic analysis of composition and dynamics.,"The numerically most abundant biological entities on Earth are viruses. Vast populations prey on the cellular microbiota in all habitats, including the human gut. Here we review approaches for studying the human virome, and some recent results on movement of viral sequences between bacterial cells and eukaryotic hosts. We first overview biochemical and bioinformatic methods, emphasizing that specific choices in the methods used can have strong effects on the results obtained. We then review studies characterizing the virome of the healthy human gut, which reveal that most of the viruses detected are typically uncharacterized phage - the viral dark matter - and that viruses that infect human cells are encountered only rarely. We then review movement of phage between bacterial cells during antibiotic treatment. Here a radical proposal for extensive movement of antibiotic genes on phage has been challenged by a careful reanalysis of the metagenomic annotation methods used. We then review two recent studies of movement of whole phage communities between human individuals during fecal microbial transplantation, which emphasize the possible role of lysogeny in dispersal. Methods for studying the human gut virome are improving, yielding interesting data on movement of phage genes between cells and mammalian host organisms. However, viral populations are vast, and studies of their composition and function are just beginning.",Aggarwala V; Liang G; Bushman FD,Mobile DNA,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29026445/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28959937,Genome Editing of Food-Grade Lactobacilli To Develop Therapeutic Probiotics.,"Lactic acid bacteria have been used historically for food manufacturing mainly to ensure preservation via fermentation. More recently, lactic acid bacteria have been exploited to promote human health, and many strains serve as industrial workhorses. Recent advances in microbiology and molecular biology have contributed to understanding the genetic basis of many of their functional attributes. These include dissection of biochemical processes that drive food fermentation, and identification and characterization of health-promoting features that positively impact the composition and roles of microbiomes in human health. Recently, the advent of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-based technologies has revolutionized our ability to manipulate genomes, and we are on the cusp of a broad-scale genome editing revolution. Here, we discuss recent advances in genetic alteration of food-grade bacteria, with a focus on CRISPR-associated enzyme genome editing, single-stranded DNA recombineering, and the modification of bacteriophages. These tools open new avenues for the genesis of next-generation biotherapeutic agents with improved genotypes and enhanced health-promoting functional features.",van Pijkeren JP; Barrangou R,Microbiology spectrum,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28959937/,1,0,0,0,0,0

This article obtained information through search of evidence-based scientific databases, especially the US National Library of Medicine NIH. (A) MSG is a water-soluble salt of glutamate, a non-essential amino acid, normally synthesized in the body and prevalent in protein foods. (B) MSG is utilized world-wide for its ""umami"" taste and flavor enhancement qualities, (C) the human body does not discriminate between glutamate present in food and that added as seasoning, (D) glutamate metabolism is compartmentalized in the human body without reported ethnic differences, (E) glutamate does not passively cross biological membranes, (F) food glutamate is completely metabolized by gut cells as energy source and serves as key substrate for other important metabolites in the liver, (G) normal food use of MSG is dose-dependent and self-limiting without elevation in plasma glutamate, (H) the recent EFSA acceptable daily intake (30mg/kg body weight/day) is not attainable when MSG is consumed at normal dietary level, (I) scientists have not been able to consistently elicit reactions in double-blind studies with 'sensitive' individuals using MSG or placebo in food.

28864984,The Importance of the Periconception Period: Immediate Effects in Cattle Breeding and in Assisted Reproduction Such as Artificial Insemination and Embryo Transfer.,"In livestock breeding, the successful outcome is largely depending on the ""periconception environment"" which, in a narrow sense, refers to the genital tract, where gametogenesis and embryogenesis occur. During these early stages of development, gametes and embryos are known to be particularly sensitive to alterations in their microenvironment. However, as the microenvironment somehow reflects what is going on in the external world, we must widen our definition of ""periconception environment"" and refer to all events taking place around the time of conception, including metabolic state and health and nutrition of the dam. In modern dairy cows that have to manage an optimal reproductive performance with continued growth and high milk yield, the periconception period is particularly challenging. The metabolic priority for growth and lactation is known to generate adverse conditions hampering optimal ovarian function, oocyte maturation, and development of embryo/fetus. In addition, by using artificial reproductive technologies (ARTs), gametes and/or embryos of livestock are exposed to unnatural conditions outside the male and female genital tract. Artificial insemination, the most widely used technique, is currently yielding pregnancy rates similar to natural mating, and calves produced by AI are equally viable after natural mating. In contrast, other ART, such as multiple ovulation and embryo transfer, have been reported to induce changes in gene expression and DNA methylation patterns with potential consequences for development.Finally, the ""periconceptional"" environment has been shown to not only influence the successful establishment of pregnancy but also the long-term health and productivity of the offspring. Hence, the optimization of management around the time of conception might open doors to improve animal production and product quality.",Van Eetvelde M; Heras S; Leroy JLMR; Van Soom A; Opsomer G,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28864984/,1,0,0,0,0,0

28832963,The role of the red blood cell in host defence against falciparum malaria: an expanding repertoire of evolutionary alterations.,"The malaria parasite has co-evolved with its human host as each organism struggles for resources and survival. The scars of this war are carried in the human genome in the form of polymorphisms that confer innate resistance to malaria. Clinical, epidemiological and genome-wide association studies have identified multiple polymorphisms in red blood cell (RBC) proteins that attenuate malaria pathogenesis. These include well-known polymorphisms in haemoglobin, intracellular enzymes, RBC channels, RBC surface markers, and proteins impacting the RBC cytoskeleton and RBC morphology. A better understanding of how changes in RBC physiology impact malaria pathogenesis may uncover new strategies to combat the disease.",Goheen MM; Campino S; Cerami C,British journal of haematology,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28832963/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28799803,"Nutrition, inflammation and liver-spleen axis.","Chronic low-grade systemic inflammation represents a mechanism common to many diseases linked to atherosclerosis-related pathways. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that the combination of food quantity and quality along with genetic susceptibility are able to induce the aberrant activation of innate immune signalling, which initially contributes to chronic low-grade inflammation. Liver represents the central player to inflammatory response. Dietary/metabolic factors contribute to the pathogenesis of Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), the main causes of liver disease in the Western world. Enlargement of the spleen, central organ in regulating the inflammation-related immune response, is commonly seen in patients with of NAFLD, depicting the so called ""liver-spleen axis."" The aim of this review was to provide an at-a-glance overview of the possible bi-directional mechanisms linking nutrition and inflammation, particularly pinpointing the inflammatory effects stemmed by nutrition on ""liver-spleen axis."" In particular, the role of unhealthy diet, healthy dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet style, dietary vitamins and micronutrients, such as vitamin D or Magnesium, and Glucagon-Like Peptide-1, a well-known incretin released in response to meal intake, will be discussed. The highly variability of the inflammatory response highlights the role of expert nutritionists in refining methodologies apt to assess nutritional epidemiology and to apply appropriate dietary intervention to counteract diet-induced inflammation mechanisms.",Barrea L; Di Somma C; Muscogiuri G; Tarantino G; Tenore GC; Orio F; Colao A; Savastano S,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28799803/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28796136,Local and Systemic Expression of Immunomodulatory Factors in Chronic Pancreatitis.,"Inflammatory and fibrotic events that drive chronic pancreatitis (CP) are likely orchestrated via signaling of soluble cytokines and chemokines systemically and within the pancreas. However, a comprehensive summary of the expression of such factors during CP has not been reported to date. This information is important given continued interest in targeting cytokines that influence CP pathogenesis. Reported data on the expression change of soluble immunomodulatory factors in human CP patients were identified via a literature search using a single search term. Thirty-one articles meeting the prespecified inclusion criteria were identified to generate a compiled data summary. Compiled data demonstrated up-regulation of several factors in the blood or pancreas microenvironment of CP patients. Nine factors were elevated in both compartments, including fractalkine, IFN-γ, interleukin 1β, IL-6, IL-8, macrophage inhibitory cytokine 1, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, transforming growth factor β, and tumor necrosis factor α. Most up-regulated factors could be classified into one of several functional groups, including inflammation, chemotaxis, angiogenesis, bone remodeling, extracellular matrix remodeling, and pain. After further validation, these factors may be used as biomarkers for disease diagnosis and identification of comorbidities, or as potential therapeutic targets.",Komar HM; Hart PA; Cruz-Monserrate Z; Conwell DL; Lesinski GB,Pancreas,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28796136/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28792500,"Malaria, malnutrition, and birthweight: A meta-analysis using individual participant data.","Four studies previously indicated that the effect of malaria infection during pregnancy on the risk of low birthweight (LBW; <2,500 g) may depend upon maternal nutritional status. We investigated this dependence further using a large, diverse study population. We evaluated the interaction between maternal malaria infection and maternal anthropometric status on the risk of LBW using pooled data from 14,633 pregnancies from 13 studies (6 cohort studies and 7 randomized controlled trials) conducted in Africa and the Western Pacific from 1996-2015. Studies were identified by the Maternal Malaria and Malnutrition (M3) initiative using a convenience sampling approach and were eligible for pooling given adequate ethical approval and availability of essential variables. Study-specific adjusted effect estimates were calculated using inverse probability of treatment-weighted linear and log-binomial regression models and pooled using a random-effects model. The adjusted risk of delivering a baby with LBW was 8.8% among women with malaria infection at antenatal enrollment compared to 7.7% among uninfected women (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 1.14 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.91, 1.42]; N = 13,613), 10.5% among women with malaria infection at delivery compared to 7.9% among uninfected women (aRR 1.32 [95% CI: 1.08, 1.62]; N = 11,826), and 15.3% among women with low mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC <23 cm) at enrollment compared to 9.5% among women with MUAC ≥ 23 cm (aRR 1.60 [95% CI: 1.36, 1.87]; N = 9,008). The risk of delivering a baby with LBW was 17.8% among women with both malaria infection and low MUAC at enrollment compared to 8.4% among uninfected women with MUAC ≥ 23 cm (joint aRR 2.13 [95% CI: 1.21, 3.73]; N = 8,152). There was no evidence of synergism (i.e., excess risk due to interaction) between malaria infection and MUAC on the multiplicative (p = 0.5) or additive scale (p = 0.9). Results were similar using body mass index (BMI) as an anthropometric indicator of nutritional status. Meta-regression results indicated that there may be multiplicative interaction between malaria infection at enrollment and low MUAC within studies conducted in Africa; however, this finding was not consistent on the additive scale, when accounting for multiple comparisons, or when using other definitions of malaria and malnutrition. The major limitations of the study included availability of only 2 cross-sectional measurements of malaria and the limited availability of ultrasound-based pregnancy dating to assess impacts on preterm birth and fetal growth in all studies. Pregnant women with malnutrition and malaria infection are at increased risk of LBW compared to women with only 1 risk factor or none, but malaria and malnutrition do not act synergistically.",Cates JE; Unger HW; Briand V; Fievet N; Valea I; Tinto H; D'Alessandro U; Landis SH; Adu-Afarwuah S; Dewey KG; Ter Kuile FO; Desai M; Dellicour S; Ouma P; Gutman J; Oneko M; Slutsker L; Terlouw DJ; Kariuki S; Ayisi J; Madanitsa M; Mwapasa V; Ashorn P; Maleta K; Mueller I; Stanisic D; Schmiegelow C; Lusingu JPA; van Eijk AM; Bauserman M; Adair L; Cole SR; Westreich D; Meshnick S; Rogerson S,PLoS medicine,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28792500/,0,0,0,1,0,0

28768707,Impact of Childhood Malnutrition on Host Defense and Infection.,"The global impact of childhood malnutrition is staggering. The synergism between malnutrition and infection contributes substantially to childhood morbidity and mortality. Anthropometric indicators of malnutrition are associated with the increased risk and severity of infections caused by many pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and helminths. Since childhood malnutrition commonly involves the inadequate intake of protein and calories, with superimposed micronutrient deficiencies, the causal factors involved in impaired host defense are usually not defined. This review focuses on literature related to impaired host defense and the risk of infection in primary childhood malnutrition. Particular attention is given to longitudinal and prospective cohort human studies and studies of experimental animal models that address causal, mechanistic relationships between malnutrition and host defense. Protein and micronutrient deficiencies impact the hematopoietic and lymphoid organs and compromise both innate and adaptive immune functions. Malnutrition-related changes in intestinal microbiota contribute to growth faltering and dysregulated inflammation and immune function. Although substantial progress has been made in understanding the malnutrition-infection synergism, critical gaps in our understanding remain. We highlight the need for mechanistic studies that can lead to targeted interventions to improve host defense and reduce the morbidity and mortality of infectious diseases in this vulnerable population.",Ibrahim MK; Zambruni M; Melby CL; Melby PC,Clinical microbiology reviews,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28768707/,1,0,0,0,0,1

Rare genetic syndromes have uncovered the contribution of barrier disruption, mediated in part by defective desmosomes and dysregulated transforming growth factor beta production and signaling, to eosinophilic esophagitis pathophysiology. Experimental modeling has defined a cooperative role of activated eosinophils, mast cells, and the cytokines IL-5 and IL-13, mediated by allergic sensitization to multiple foods. Understanding these processes is opening the way to better treatment based on disrupting allergic inflammatory and type 2 cytokine-mediated responses, including anti-cytokine therapeutics and dietary therapy.",O'Shea KM; Aceves SS; Dellon ES; Gupta SK; Spergel JM; Furuta GT; Rothenberg ME,Gastroenterology,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28757265/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28746353,Delayed breastfeeding initiation and infant survival: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"To assess the existing evidence regarding breastfeeding initiation time and infant morbidity and mortality. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, Popline, LILACS, AIM, and Index Medicus to identify existing evidence. We included observational studies and randomized control trials that examined the association between breastfeeding initiation time and mortality, morbidity, or nutrition outcomes from birth through 12 months of age in a population of infants who all initiated breastfeeding. Two reviewers independently extracted data from eligible studies using a standardized form. We pooled effect estimates using fixed-effects meta-analysis. We pooled five studies, including 136,047 infants, which examined the association between very early breastfeeding initiation and neonatal mortality. Compared to infants who initiated breastfeeding ≤1 hour after birth, infants who initiated breastfeeding 2-23 hours after birth had a 33% greater risk of neonatal mortality (95% CI: 13-56%, I2 = 0%), and infants who initiated breastfeeding ≥24 hours after birth had a 2.19-fold greater risk of neonatal mortality (95% CI: 1.73-2.77, I2 = 33%). Among the subgroup of infants exclusively breastfed in the neonatal period, those who initiated breastfeeding ≥24 hours after birth had an 85% greater risk of neonatal mortality compared to infants who initiated <24 hours after birth (95% CI: 29-167%, I2 = 33%). Policy frameworks and models to estimate newborn and infant survival, as well as health facility policies, should consider the potential independent effect of early breastfeeding initiation.",Smith ER; Hurt L; Chowdhury R; Sinha B; Fawzi W; Edmond KM,PloS one,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28746353/,0,1,0,1,0,0
28743984,Gut microbiota and IBD: causation or correlation?,"A general consensus exists that IBD is associated with compositional and metabolic changes in the intestinal microbiota (dysbiosis). However, a direct causal relationship between dysbiosis and IBD has not been definitively established in humans. Findings from animal models have revealed diverse and context-specific roles of the gut microbiota in health and disease, ranging from protective to pro-inflammatory actions. Moreover, evidence from these experimental models suggest that although gut bacteria often drive immune activation, chronic inflammation in turn shapes the gut microbiota and contributes to dysbiosis. The purpose of this Review is to summarize current associations between IBD and dysbiosis, describe the role of the gut microbiota in the context of specific animal models of colitis, and discuss the potential role of microbiota-focused interventions in the treatment of human IBD. Ultimately, more studies will be needed to define host-microbial relationships relevant to human disease and amenable to therapeutic interventions.",Ni J; Wu GD; Albenberg L; Tomov VT,Nature reviews.

28743601,Reproductive factors and risk of Parkinson's disease in women: A meta-analysis of observational studies.,"Evidence on the relationship between reproductive factors, use of oral contraceptives (OCs) and the incidence of Parkinson's disease (PD) remain inconclusive. The aim of this meta-analysis is to evaluate whether relevant reproductive factors including age at menarche, age at menopause, fertile lifespan, parity, type of menopause (surgical versus natural), and use of OCs are associated with risk of PD in women via random-effects model. PubMed and EMBASE database were used to search for case-control or cohort studies published before February17, 2017. 6 case-control and 5 cohort studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled relative risks (RRs) of PD risk were 1.00 (95% CI: 0.79-1.28) for use of OCs (ever versus never), 1.03 (95% CI: 0.84-1.26) for age at menarche, 0.98 (95% CI: 0.75-1.29) for age at menopause, 0.98(95% CI: 0.77-1.25) for fertile lifespan, 0.99(95% CI:0.0.79-1.25) for parity, 0.93 (95% CI:0.68-1.29) for type of menopause (surgical versus natural). In the subgroup analysis stratified by study design, age, caffeine intake and smoking, an inverse association was found between surgical menopause and risk of PD for those adjusting for caffeine intake (RR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.45-0.99) and smoking (RR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.63-0.94); while a positive association was found between surgical menopause and PD risk for those not adjusting for smoking (RR: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.29-2.83). In conclusion, our meta-analysis provided little epidemiological support for the role of reproductive factors in the incidence of PD. Whether surgical menopause is inversely associated with the risk of PD requires further explorations.",Lv M; Zhang Y; Chen GC; Li G; Rui Y; Qin L; Wan Z,Behavioural brain research,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28743601/,1,0,0,1,0,0

28724643,A review of the characteristics of dietary fibers relevant to appetite and energy intake outcomes in human intervention trials.,"<b>Background:</b> Many intervention studies have tested the effect of dietary fibers (DFs) on appetite-related outcomes, with inconsistent results. However, DFs comprise a wide range of compounds with diverse properties, and the specific contribution of these to appetite control is not well characterized.<b>Objective:</b> The influence of specific DF characteristics [i.e., viscosity, gel-forming capacity, fermentability, or molecular weight (MW)] on appetite-related outcomes was assessed in healthy humans.<b>Design:</b> Controlled human intervention trials that tested the effects of well-characterized DFs on appetite ratings or energy intake were identified from a systematic search of literature. Studies were included only if they reported <i>1</i>) DF name and origin and <i>2</i>) data on viscosity, gelling properties, fermentability, or MW of the DF materials or DF-containing matrixes.<b>Results:</b> A high proportion of the potentially relevant literature was excluded because of lack of adequate DF characterization. In total, 49 articles that met these criteria were identified, which reported 90 comparisons of various DFs in foods, beverages, or supplements in acute or sustained-exposure trials. In 51 of the 90 comparisons, the DF-containing material of interest was efficacious for ≥1 appetite-related outcome. Reported differences in material viscosity, MW, or fermentability did not clearly correspond to differences in efficacy, whereas gel-forming DF sources were consistently efficacious (but with very few comparisons).<b>Conclusions:</b> The overall inconsistent relations of DF properties with respect to efficacy may reflect variation in measurement methodology, nature of the DF preparation and matrix, and study designs. Methods of DF characterization, incorporation, and study design are too inconsistent to allow generalized conclusions about the effects of DF properties on appetite and preclude the development of reliable, predictive, structure-function relations. Improved standards for characterization and reporting of DF sources and DF-containing materials are strongly recommended for future studies on the effects of DF on human physiology.

28701368,Kunkel Lecture: Fundamental immunodeficiency and its correction.,"""Fundamental immunodeficiency"" is the inability of the encoded immune system to protect an otherwise healthy host from every infection that could threaten its life. In contrast to primary immunodeficiencies, fundamental immunodeficiency is not rare but nearly universal. It results not from variation in a given host gene but from the rate and extent of variation in the genes of other organisms. The remedy for fundamental immunodeficiency is ""adopted immunity,"" not to be confused with adaptive or adoptive immunity. Adopted immunity arises from four critical societal contributions to the survival of the human species: sanitation, nutrition, vaccines, and antimicrobial agents. Immunologists have a great deal to contribute to the development of vaccines and antimicrobial agents, but they have focused chiefly on vaccines, and vaccinology is thriving. In contrast, the effect of antimicrobial agents in adopted immunity, although fundamental, is fragile and failing.

Categorized and dose-response meta-analyses were performed to quantify this relation. Potentially eligible studies were identified by searching PubMed and Embase databases. Dose-response effects were assessed by the generalized least squares trend estimation and study-specific summary relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed with a random-effects model. Seven prospective studies including one US, four European, and two Chinese cohorts involving 249,077 participants and 13,237 cases of T2D were included. The overall analyses showed a 17% increased risk of T2D when comparing habitual nappers with non-nappers (RR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.08-1.27). By region, the summary RR was 1.21 (95% CI 1.17-1.26), 1.15 (95% CI 1.03-1.30) and 1.23 (95% CI 0.87-1.73) for the US, European, and Chinese studies, respectively. Limiting to five studies that excluded subjects with known major chronic disorders yielded a summary RR of 1.16 (95% CI 1.03-1.30). A dose-response analysis suggested an 11% (95% CI 7-16%) increased T2D risk for each increment in daytime napping of 30 min/day and, despite no evidence for nonlinearity (P <sub>nonlinearity</sub> = 0.65), the increased risk of T2D for short nap (<50 min/day) was dominated by the US study. This meta-analysis suggests that daytime napping is associated with an increased risk of T2D. Given the limited number of cohorts and inconsistency in terms of methodological and population characteristics across these cohorts, residual confounders and/or reverse causality cannot be fully addressed, and our findings should be interpreted with great caution.

In low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), there may be factors that have a substantial impact on the size of the latent HIV reservoir and the immunological response to infection. If a curative strategy is to be available to all HIV-infected individuals, these factors must be understood. We use a scoping review to examine the literature on biological factors that may have an impact on HIV persistence in LMIC. Three databases were searched without date restrictions. Uncontrolled viral replication and higher coinfection prevalence may alter the immunological milieu of individuals in LMIC and increase the size of the HIV reservoir. Differences in HIV subtype could also influence the measurement and size of the HIV reservoir. Immune activation may differ due to late presentation to care, presence of chronic infections, increased gut translocation of bacterial products and poor nutrition. Research on HIV remission is urgently needed in LMIC. Research into chronic immune activation in resource poor environments, the immune response to infection, the mechanisms of HIV persistence and latency in different viral clades and the effect of the microbiological milieu must be performed.

No systematic review has addressed the effect of isoenergetic fructose replacement of other sugars and its effect on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose, insulin, and triglycerides.<b>Objective:</b> The objective of this study was to review the evidence for a reduction in fasting glycemic and insulinemic markers after chronic, isoenergetic replacement of glucose or sucrose in foods or beverages by fructose. The target populations were persons without diabetes, those with impaired glucose tolerance, and those with type 2 diabetes.<b>Design:</b> We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal, and clinicaltrials.gov The date of the last search was 26 April 2016. We included randomized controlled trials of isoenergetic replacement of glucose, sucrose, or both by fructose in adults or children with or without diabetes of ≥2 wk duration that measured fasting blood glucose. The main outcomes analyzed were fasting blood glucose and insulin as well as fasting triglycerides, blood lipoproteins, HbA1c, and body weight.<b>Results:</b> We included 14 comparison arms from 11 trials, including 277 patients. The studies varied in length from 2 to 10 wk (mean: 28 d) and included doses of fructose between 40 and 150 g/d (mean: 68 g/d). Fructose substitution in some subgroups resulted in significantly but only slightly lowered fasting blood glucose (-0.14 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.24, -0.036 mmol/L), HbA1c [-10 g/L (95% CI: -12.90, -7.10 g/L; impaired glucose tolerance) and -6 g/L (95% CI: -8.47, -3.53 g/L; normoglycemia)], triglycerides (-0.08 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.14, -0.02 mmol/L), and body weight (-1.40 kg; 95% CI: -2.07, -0.74 kg). There was no effect on fasting blood insulin or blood lipids.<b>Conclusions:</b> The evidence suggests that the substitution of fructose for glucose or sucrose in food or beverages may be of benefit to individuals, particularly those with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes. However, additional high-quality studies in these populations are required.",Evans RA; Frese M; Romero J; Cunningham JH; Mills KE,The American journal of clinical nutrition,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28592603/,0,1,0,1,0,0
28589087,Nodular Thyroid Disease and Thyroid Cancer in the Era of Precision Medicine.,"The management of thyroid nodules, one of the main clinical challenges in endocrine clinical practice, is usually straightforward. Although the most important concern is ruling out malignancy, there are grey areas where uncertainty is frequently present: the nodules labelled as indeterminate by cytology and the extent of therapy when thyroid cancer is diagnosed pathologically. There is evidence that the current available precision medicine tools (from all the ""-omics"" to molecular analysis, fine-tuning imaging or artificial intelligence) may help to fill present gaps in the future. We present here a commentary on some of the current challenges faced by endocrinologists in the field of thyroid nodules and cancer, and illustrate how precision medicine may improve their diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities in the future.",Zafon C; Díez JJ; Galofré JC; Cooper DS,European thyroid journal,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28589087/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28577489,European contribution to the study of ROS: A summary of the findings and prospects for the future from the COST action BM1203 (EU-ROS).,"The European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) provides an ideal framework to establish multi-disciplinary research networks. COST Action BM1203 (EU-ROS) represents a consortium of researchers from different disciplines who are dedicated to providing new insights and tools for better understanding redox biology and medicine and, in the long run, to finding new therapeutic strategies to target dysregulated redox processes in various diseases. This report highlights the major achievements of EU-ROS as well as research updates and new perspectives arising from its members. The EU-ROS consortium comprised more than 140 active members who worked together for four years on the topics briefly described below. The formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) is an established hallmark of our aerobic environment and metabolism but RONS also act as messengers via redox regulation of essential cellular processes. The fact that many diseases have been found to be associated with oxidative stress established the theory of oxidative stress as a trigger of diseases that can be corrected by antioxidant therapy. However, while experimental studies support this thesis, clinical studies still generate controversial results, due to complex pathophysiology of oxidative stress in humans. For future improvement of antioxidant therapy and better understanding of redox-associated disease progression detailed knowledge on the sources and targets of RONS formation and discrimination of their detrimental or beneficial roles is required. In order to advance this important area of biology and medicine, highly synergistic approaches combining a variety of diverse and contrasting disciplines are needed.",Egea J; Fabregat I; Frapart YM; Ghezzi P; Görlach A; Kietzmann T; Kubaichuk K; Knaus UG; Lopez MG; Olaso-Gonzalez G; Petry A; Schulz R; Vina J; Winyard P; Abbas K; Ademowo OS; Afonso CB; Andreadou I; Antelmann H; Antunes F; Aslan M; Bachschmid MM; Barbosa RM; Belousov V; Berndt C; Bernlohr D; Bertrán E; Bindoli A; Bottari SP; Brito PM; Carrara G; Casas AI; Chatzi A; Chondrogianni N; Conrad M; Cooke MS; Costa JG; Cuadrado A; My-Chan Dang P; De Smet B; Debelec-Butuner B; Dias IHK; Dunn JD; Edson AJ; El Assar M; El-Benna J; Ferdinandy P; Fernandes AS; Fladmark KE; Förstermann U; Giniatullin R; Giricz Z; Görbe A; Griffiths H; Hampl V; Hanf A; Herget J; Hernansanz-Agustín P; Hillion M; Huang J; Ilikay S; Jansen-Dürr P; Jaquet V; Joles JA; Kalyanaraman B; Kaminskyy D; Karbaschi M; Kleanthous M; Klotz LO; Korac B; Korkmaz KS; Koziel R; Kračun D; Krause KH; Křen V; Krieg T; Laranjinha J; Lazou A; Li H; Martínez-Ruiz A; Matsui R; McBean GJ; Meredith SP; Messens J; Miguel V; Mikhed Y; Milisav I; Milković L; Miranda-Vizuete A; Mojović M; Monsalve M; Mouthuy PA; Mulvey J; Münzel T; Muzykantov V; Nguyen ITN; Oelze M; Oliveira NG; Palmeira CM; Papaevgeniou N; Pavićević A; Pedre B; Peyrot F; Phylactides M; Pircalabioru GG; Pitt AR; Poulsen HE; Prieto I; Rigobello MP; Robledinos-Antón N; Rodríguez-Mañas L; Rolo AP; Rousset F; Ruskovska T; Saraiva N; Sasson S; Schröder K; Semen K; Seredenina T; Shakirzyanova A; Smith GL; Soldati T; Sousa BC; Spickett CM; Stancic A; Stasia MJ; Steinbrenner H; Stepanić V; Steven S; Tokatlidis K; Tuncay E; Turan B; Ursini F; Vacek J; Vajnerova O; Valentová K; Van Breusegem F; Varisli L; Veal EA; Yalçın AS; Yelisyeyeva O; Žarković N; Zatloukalová M; Zielonka J; Touyz RM; Papapetropoulos A; Grune T; Lamas S; Schmidt HHHW; Di Lisa F; Daiber A,Redox biology,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28577489/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28476139,Optimizing methods and dodging pitfalls in microbiome research.,"Research on the human microbiome has yielded numerous insights into health and disease, but also has resulted in a wealth of experimental artifacts. Here, we present suggestions for optimizing experimental design and avoiding known pitfalls, organized in the typical order in which studies are carried out. We first review best practices in experimental design and introduce common confounders such as age, diet, antibiotic use, pet ownership, longitudinal instability, and microbial sharing during cohousing in animal studies. Typically, samples will need to be stored, so we provide data on best practices for several sample types. We then discuss design and analysis of positive and negative controls, which should always be run with experimental samples. We introduce a convenient set of non-biological DNA sequences that can be useful as positive controls for high-volume analysis. Careful analysis of negative and positive controls is particularly important in studies of samples with low microbial biomass, where contamination can comprise most or all of a sample. Lastly, we summarize approaches to enhancing experimental robustness by careful control of multiple comparisons and to comparing discovery and validation cohorts. We hope the experimental tactics summarized here will help researchers in this exciting field advance their studies efficiently while avoiding errors.",Kim D; Hofstaedter CE; Zhao C; Mattei L; Tanes C; Clarke E; Lauder A; Sherrill-Mix S; Chehoud C; Kelsen J; Conrad M; Collman RG; Baldassano R; Bushman FD; Bittinger K,Microbiome,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28476139/,1,0,0,0,0,1
28448460,Assessing Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Health Co-Benefits: A Structured Review of Lifestyle-Related Climate Change Mitigation Strategies.,"This is the first structured review to identify and summarize research on lifestyle choices that improve health and have the greatest potential to mitigate climate change. Two literature searches were conducted on: (1) active transport health co-benefits, and (2) dietary health co-benefits. Articles needed to quantify both greenhouse gas emissions and health or nutrition outcomes resulting from active transport or diet changes. A data extraction tool (PRISMA) was created for article selection and evaluation. A rubric was devised to assess the biases, limitations and uncertainties of included articles. For active transport 790 articles were retrieved, nine meeting the inclusion criteria. For diet 2524 articles were retrieved, 23 meeting the inclusion criteria. A total of 31 articles were reviewed and assessed using the rubric, as one article met the inclusion criteria for both active transport and diet co-benefits. Methods used to estimate the effect of diet or active transport modification vary greatly precluding meta-analysis. The scale of impact on health and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) outcomes depends predominately on the aggressiveness of the diet or active transport scenario modelled, versus the modelling technique. Effective mitigation policies, infrastructure that supports active transport and low GHGE food delivery, plus community engagement are integral in achieving optimal health and GHGE outcomes. Variation in culture, nutritional and health status, plus geographic density will determine which mitigation scenario(s) best suit individual communities.",Quam VGM; Rocklöv J; Quam MBM; Lucas RAI,International journal of environmental research and public health,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28448460/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28430825,Discovery and fine-mapping of adiposity loci using high density imputation of genome-wide association studies in individuals of African ancestry: African Ancestry Anthropometry Genetics Consortium.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified >300 loci associated with measures of adiposity including body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (adjusted for BMI, WHRadjBMI), but few have been identified through screening of the African ancestry genomes. We performed large scale meta-analyses and replications in up to 52,895 individuals for BMI and up to 23,095 individuals for WHRadjBMI from the African Ancestry Anthropometry Genetics Consortium (AAAGC) using 1000 Genomes phase 1 imputed GWAS to improve coverage of both common and low frequency variants in the low linkage disequilibrium African ancestry genomes. In the sex-combined analyses, we identified one novel locus (TCF7L2/HABP2) for WHRadjBMI and eight previously established loci at P < 5×10-8: seven for BMI, and one for WHRadjBMI in African ancestry individuals. An additional novel locus (SPRYD7/DLEU2) was identified for WHRadjBMI when combined with European GWAS. In the sex-stratified analyses, we identified three novel loci for BMI (INTS10/LPL and MLC1 in men, IRX4/IRX2 in women) and four for WHRadjBMI (SSX2IP, CASC8, PDE3B and ZDHHC1/HSD11B2 in women) in individuals of African ancestry or both African and European ancestry. For four of the novel variants, the minor allele frequency was low (<5%). In the trans-ethnic fine mapping of 47 BMI loci and 27 WHRadjBMI loci that were locus-wide significant (P < 0.05 adjusted for effective number of variants per locus) from the African ancestry sex-combined and sex-stratified analyses, 26 BMI loci and 17 WHRadjBMI loci contained ≤ 20 variants in the credible sets that jointly account for 99% posterior probability of driving the associations. The lead variants in 13 of these loci had a high probability of being causal. As compared to our previous HapMap imputed GWAS for BMI and WHRadjBMI including up to 71,412 and 27,350 African ancestry individuals, respectively, our results suggest that 1000 Genomes imputation showed modest improvement in identifying GWAS loci including low frequency variants. Trans-ethnic meta-analyses further improved fine mapping of putative causal variants in loci shared between the African and European ancestry populations.",Ng MCY; Graff M; Lu Y; Justice AE; Mudgal P; Liu CT; Young K; Yanek LR; Feitosa MF; Wojczynski MK; Rand K; Brody JA; Cade BE; Dimitrov L; Duan Q; Guo X; Lange LA; Nalls MA; Okut H; Tajuddin SM; Tayo BO; Vedantam S; Bradfield JP; Chen G; Chen WM; Chesi A; Irvin MR; Padhukasahasram B; Smith JA; Zheng W; Allison MA; Ambrosone CB; Bandera EV; Bartz TM; Berndt SI; Bernstein L; Blot WJ; Bottinger EP; Carpten J; Chanock SJ; Chen YI; Conti DV; Cooper RS; Fornage M; Freedman BI; Garcia M; Goodman PJ; Hsu YH; Hu J; Huff CD; Ingles SA; John EM; Kittles R; Klein E; Li J; McKnight B; Nayak U; Nemesure B; Ogunniyi A; Olshan A; Press MF; Rohde R; Rybicki BA; Salako B; Sanderson M; Shao Y; Siscovick DS; Stanford JL; Stevens VL; Stram A; Strom SS; Vaidya D; Witte JS; Yao J; Zhu X; Ziegler RG; Zonderman AB; Adeyemo A; Ambs S; Cushman M; Faul JD; Hakonarson H; Levin AM; Nathanson KL; Ware EB; Weir DR; Zhao W; Zhi D; Arnett DK; Grant SFA; Kardia SLR; Oloapde OI; Rao DC; Rotimi CN; Sale MM; Williams LK; Zemel BS; Becker DM; Borecki IB; Evans MK; Harris TB; Hirschhorn JN; Li Y; Patel SR; Psaty BM; Rotter JI; Wilson JG; Bowden DW; Cupples LA; Haiman CA; Loos RJF; North KE,PLoS genetics,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28430825/,0,0,0,1,0,0
28388917,Influence of diet on the gut microbiome and implications for human health.,"Recent studies have suggested that the intestinal microbiome plays an important role in modulating risk of several chronic diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. At the same time, it is now understood that diet plays a significant role in shaping the microbiome, with experiments showing that dietary alterations can induce large, temporary microbial shifts within 24 h. Given this association, there may be significant therapeutic utility in altering microbial composition through diet. This review systematically evaluates current data regarding the effects of several common dietary components on intestinal microbiota. We show that consumption of particular types of food produces predictable shifts in existing host bacterial genera. Furthermore, the identity of these bacteria affects host immune and metabolic parameters, with broad implications for human health.

Within the past few years, obesity has been shown to impair the adaptive immune response to infection through alterations in T cell functioning. Growing evidence suggests that perturbations in T cell metabolism drives this stunted immune response, stemming from nutrient, hormone and adipokine dysregulation in the obese.

28338444,The role of diet in multiple sclerosis: A review.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a multifactorial, inflammatory, and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system, where environmental factors interact with genetic susceptibility. The role of diet on MS has not been comprehensively elucidated; therefore, through an extensive search of relevant literature, this review reports the most significant evidence regarding nutrition as a possible co-factor influencing the inflammatory cascade by acting on both its molecular pathways and gut microbiota. Since nutritional status and dietary habits in MS patients have not been extensively reported, the lack of a scientific-based consensus on dietary recommendation in MS could encourage many patients to experiment alternative dietetic regimens, increasing the risk of malnutrition. This work investigates the health implications of an unbalanced diet in MS, and collects recent findings on nutrients of great interest among MS patients and physicians. The aim of this review is to elucidate the role of an accurate nutritional counseling in MS to move toward a multidisciplinary management of the disease and to encourage future studies demonstrating the role of a healthy diet on the onset and course of MS.",Esposito S; Bonavita S; Sparaco M; Gallo A; Tedeschi G,Nutritional neuroscience,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28338444/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28276943,Sleep disruption in chronic rhinosinusitis.,"Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common disease of the upper airways and paranasal sinuses with a marked decline in quality of life (QOL). CRS patients suffer from sleep disruption at a significantly higher proportion (60 to 75%) than in the general population (8-18 %). Sleep disruption in CRS causes decreased QOL and is linked to poor functional outcomes such as impaired cognitive function and depression. Areas covered: A systematic PubMed/Medline search was done to assess the results of studies that have investigated sleep and sleep disturbances in CRS. Expert commentary: These studies reported sleep disruption in most CRS patients. The main risk factors for sleep disruption in CRS include allergic rhinitis, smoking, and high SNOT-22 total scores. The literature is inconsistent with regard to the prevalence of sleep-related disordered breathing (e.g. obstructive sleep apnea) in CRS patients. Although nasal obstruction is linked to sleep disruption, the extent of sleep disruption in CRS seems to expand beyond that expected from physical blockage of the upper airways alone. Despite the high prevalence of sleep disruption in CRS, and its detrimental effects on QOL, the literature contains a paucity of studies that have investigated the mechanisms underlying this major problem in CRS.",Mahdavinia M; Schleimer RP; Keshavarzian A,Expert review of anti-infective therapy,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28276943/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Therapy improves the principal manifestations of the condition and, as a consequence, many patients show a modified phenotype which reflects manifestations of their disease that are refractory to treatment. More generally, it is increasingly recognised that information as to how a patient feels and functions [obtained by patient- reported outcome measurements (PROMs)] is critical to any comprehensive evaluation of treatment. A new set of management goals for GD1 in which both trends are reflected is needed. To this end, a modified Delphi procedure among 25 experts was performed. Based on a literature review and with input from patients, 65 potential goals were formulated as statements. Consensus was considered to be reached when ≥75% of the participants agreed to include that specific statement in the management goals. There was agreement on 42 statements. In addition to the traditional goals concerning haematological, visceral and bone manifestations, improvement in quality of life, fatigue and social participation, as well as early detection of long-term complications or associated diseases were included.

28263464,Assessment of Hepatic Impairment and Implications for Pharmacokinetics of Substance Use Treatment.,"Although the liver is the primary site of metabolism and biliary excretion for many medications, data are limited on the liver's pharmacokinetic abilities in cirrhosis. Cirrhosis develops through collagen deposition, eventually culminating in end-stage liver disease that compromises hepatic drug metabolism. Consequently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends evaluating the pharmacokinetics of medications in subjects with hepatic impairment if hepatic metabolism constitutes more than 20% of their elimination or if they have a narrow therapeutic range. A variety of noninvasive indices and radiologic procedures can be employed to assess hepatic drug metabolism and excretion. The Child-Pugh score is the most commonly used scale for assessing hepatic impairment among drugs submitted for US FDA approval. The score, originally developed to guide operative mortality in patients undergoing hepatic resection, has not been modified since its inception 5 decades ago. Furthermore, the score was not originally intended to be a guide for potential dose modification in patients with hepatic impairment. These reasons, in combination with the availability of a variety of new imaging modalities and an enhanced understanding of hepatic biology, should foster the development of novel methods to assess the effect of hepatic impairment on liver drug metabolism.",Talal AH; Venuto CS; Younis I,Clinical pharmacology in drug development,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28263464/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Literature review, research data, and expert opinion. Not applicable. Moderated by an expert from the field, issues relevant to the association of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome with a variety of conditions were presented, discussed, and debated with a focus on identifying knowledge gaps and research priorities. Summary of presentations and discussion supported and supplemented by relevant literature. Among critically ill children, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome is relatively common and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. For outcomes to improve, effective therapies aimed at preventing and treating this condition must be discovered and rigorously evaluated. In this article, a number of potential opportunities to enhance current care are highlighted including the need for a better understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of medications, the effect of early and optimized nutrition, and the impact of effective glucose control in the setting of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Additionally, a handful of the promising therapies either currently being implemented or developed are described. These include extracorporeal therapies, anticytokine therapies, antitoxin treatments, antioxidant approaches, and multiple forms of exogenous steroids. For the field to advance, promising therapies and other therapies must be assessed in rigorous manner and implemented accordingly.",Doctor A; Zimmerman J; Agus M; Rajasekaran S; Bubeck Wardenburg J; Fortenberry J; Zajicek A; Mairson E; Typpo K,Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28248836/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28202104,Improving selection of markers in nutrition research: evaluation of the criteria proposed by the ILSI Europe Marker Validation Initiative.,"The conduct of high-quality nutrition research requires the selection of appropriate markers as outcomes, for example as indicators of food or nutrient intake, nutritional status, health status or disease risk. Such selection requires detailed knowledge of the markers, and consideration of the factors that may influence their measurement, other than the effects of nutritional change. A framework to guide selection of markers within nutrition research studies would be a valuable tool for researchers. A multidisciplinary Expert Group set out to test criteria designed to aid the evaluation of candidate markers for their usefulness in nutrition research and subsequently to develop a scoring system for markers. The proposed criteria were tested using thirteen markers selected from a broad range of nutrition research fields. The result of this testing was a modified list of criteria and a template for evaluating a potential marker against the criteria. Subsequently, a semi-quantitative system for scoring a marker and an associated template were developed. This system will enable the evaluation and comparison of different candidate markers within the same field of nutrition research in order to identify their relative usefulness. The ranking criteria of proven, strong, medium or low are likely to vary according to research setting, research field and the type of tool used to assess the marker and therefore the considerations for scoring need to be determined in a setting-, field- and tool-specific manner. A database of such markers, their interpretation and range of possible values would be valuable to nutrition researchers.",Calder PC; Boobis A; Braun D; Champ CL; Dye L; Einöther S; Greyling A; Matthys C; Putz P; Wopereis S; Woodside JV; Antoine JM,Nutrition research reviews,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28202104/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28185874,Psychosocial stress on neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunctions in Alzheimer's disease: the emerging role for microglia?,"Chronic psychosocial stress is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) and associated cognitive deficits. Chronic stress also primes microglia and induces inflammatory responses in the adult brain, thereby compromising synapse-supportive roles of microglia and deteriorating cognitive functions during aging. Substantial evidence demonstrates that failure of microglia to clear abnormally accumulating amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide contributes to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in AD. Moreover, genome-wide association studies have linked variants in several immune genes, such as TREM2 and CD33, the expression of which in the brain is restricted to microglia, with cognitive dysfunctions in LOAD. Thus, inflammation-promoting chronic stress may create a vicious cycle of aggravated microglial dysfunction accompanied by increased Aβ accumulation, collectively exacerbating neurodegeneration. Surprisingly, however, little is known about whether and how chronic stress contributes to microglia-mediated neuroinflammation that may underlie cognitive impairments in AD. This review aims to summarize the currently available clinical and preclinical data and outline potential molecular mechanisms linking stress, microglia and neurodegeneration, to foster future research in this field.",Piirainen S; Youssef A; Song C; Kalueff AV; Landreth GE; Malm T; Tian L,Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28185874/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28139173,Automatic diet monitoring: a review of computer vision and wearable sensor-based methods.,"Food intake and eating habits have a significant impact on people's health. Widespread diseases, such as diabetes and obesity, are directly related to eating habits. Therefore, monitoring diet can be a substantial base for developing methods and services to promote healthy lifestyle and improve personal and national health economy. Studies have demonstrated that manual reporting of food intake is inaccurate and often impractical. Thus, several methods have been proposed to automate the process. This article reviews the most relevant and recent researches on automatic diet monitoring, discussing their strengths and weaknesses. In particular, the article reviews two approaches to this problem, accounting for most of the work in the area. The first approach is based on image analysis and aims at extracting information about food content automatically from food images. The second one relies on wearable sensors and has the detection of eating behaviours as its main goal.",Hassannejad H; Matrella G; Ciampolini P; De Munari I; Mordonini M; Cagnoni S,International journal of food sciences and nutrition,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28139173/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28065278,Addendum guidelines for the prevention of peanut allergy in the United States: Report of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases-sponsored expert panel.,"Food allergy is an important public health problem because it affects children and adults, can be severe and even life-threatening, and may be increasing in prevalence. Beginning in 2008, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, working with other organizations and advocacy groups, led the development of the first clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and management of food allergy. A recent landmark clinical trial and other emerging data suggest that peanut allergy can be prevented through introduction of peanut-containing foods beginning in infancy. Prompted by these findings, along with 25 professional organizations, federal agencies, and patient advocacy groups, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases facilitated development of addendum guidelines to specifically address the prevention of peanut allergy. The addendum provides 3 separate guidelines for infants at various risk levels for the development of peanut allergy and is intended for use by a wide variety of health care providers. Topics addressed include the definition of risk categories, appropriate use of testing (specific IgE measurement, skin prick tests, and oral food challenges), and the timing and approaches for introduction of peanut-containing foods in the health care provider's office or at home.

27974017,HIV care and treatment experiences among female sex workers living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa: A systematic review.,"Female sex workers (FSW) living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa have poor engagement to HIV care and treatment. Understanding the HIV care and treatment engagement experiences of FSW has important implications for interventions to enhance care and treatment outcomes. We conducted a systematic review to examine the HIV care experiences and determinants of linkage and retention in care, antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, and ART adherence and viral suppression among FSW living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. The databases PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, SCOPUS, CINAHL, Global Health, Psycinfo, Sociological Abstracts, and Popline were searched for variations of search terms related to sex work and HIV care and treatment among sub-Saharan African populations. Ten peer-reviewed articles published between January 2000 and August 2015 met inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Despite expanded ART access, FSW in sub-Saharan Africa have sub-optimal HIV care and treatment engagement outcomes. Stigma, discrimination, poor nutrition, food insecurity, and substance use were commonly reported and associated with poor linkage to care, retention in care, and ART initiation. Included studies suggest that interventions with FSW should focus on multilevel barriers to engagement in HIV care and treatment and explore the involvement of social support from intimate male partners. Our results emphasise several critical points of intervention for FSW living with HIV, which are urgently needed to enhance linkage to HIV care, retention in care, and treatment initiation, particularly where the HIV prevalence among FSW is greatest.",Lancaster KE; Cernigliaro D; Zulliger R; Fleming PF,African journal of AIDS research : AJAR,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27974017/,0,1,0,0,0,0
27903825,Synthetic biology routes to bio-artificial intelligence.,"The design of synthetic gene networks (SGNs) has advanced to the extent that novel genetic circuits are now being tested for their ability to recapitulate archetypal learning behaviours first defined in the fields of machine and animal learning. Here, we discuss the biological implementation of a perceptron algorithm for linear classification of input data. An expansion of this biological design that encompasses cellular 'teachers' and 'students' is also examined. We also discuss implementation of Pavlovian associative learning using SGNs and present an example of such a scheme and in silico simulation of its performance. In addition to designed SGNs, we also consider the option to establish conditions in which a population of SGNs can evolve diversity in order to better contend with complex input data. Finally, we compare recent ethical concerns in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and the future challenges raised by bio-artificial intelligence (BI).",Nesbeth DN; Zaikin A; Saka Y; Romano MC; Giuraniuc CV; Kanakov O; Laptyeva T,Essays in biochemistry,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27903825/,1,0,0,0,0,0
27816611,Vitamin E: Emerging aspects and new directions.,"The discovery of vitamin E will have its 100th anniversary in 2022, but we still have more questions than answers regarding the biological functions and the essentiality of vitamin E for human health. Discovered as a factor essential for rat fertility and soon after characterized for its properties of fat-soluble antioxidant, vitamin E was identified to have signaling and gene regulation effects in the 1980s. In the same years the cytochrome P-450 dependent metabolism of vitamin E was characterized and a first series of studies on short-chain carboxyethyl metabolites in the 1990s paved the way to the hypothesis of a biological role for this metabolism alternative to vitamin E catabolism. In the last decade other physiological metabolites of vitamin E have been identified, such as α-tocopheryl phosphate and the long-chain metabolites formed by the ω-hydroxylase activity of cytochrome P-450. Recent findings are consistent with gene regulation and homeostatic roles of these metabolites in different experimental models, such as inflammatory, neuronal and hepatic cells, and in vivo in animal models of acute inflammation. Molecular mechanisms underlying these responses are under investigation in several laboratories and side-glances to research on other fat soluble vitamins may help to move faster in this direction. Other emerging aspects presented in this review paper include novel insights on the mechanisms of reduction of the cardiovascular risk, immunomodulation and antiallergic effects, neuroprotection properties in models of glutamate excitotoxicity and spino-cerebellar damage, hepatoprotection and prevention of liver toxicity by different causes and even therapeutic applications in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. We here discuss these topics with the aim of stimulating the interest of the scientific community and further research activities that may help to celebrate this anniversary of vitamin E with an in-depth knowledge of its action as vitamin.",Galli F; Azzi A; Birringer M; Cook-Mills JM; Eggersdorfer M; Frank J; Cruciani G; Lorkowski S; Özer NK,Free radical biology & medicine,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27816611/,1,0,0,0,0,0
27813341,Pharmacological and biological therapeutic strategies for osteogenesis imperfecta.,"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a connective tissue disorder characterized by bone fragility, low bone mass, and bone deformities. The majority of cases are caused by autosomal dominant pathogenic variants in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes that encode type I collagen, the major component of the bone matrix. The remaining cases are caused by autosomal recessively or dominantly inherited mutations in genes that are involved in the post-translational modification of type I collagen, act as type I collagen chaperones, or are members of the signaling pathways that regulate bone homeostasis. The main goals of treatment in OI are to decrease fracture incidence, relieve bone pain, and promote mobility and growth. This requires a multi-disciplinary approach, utilizing pharmacological interventions, physical therapy, orthopedic surgery, and monitoring nutrition with appropriate calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Bisphosphonate therapy, which has become the mainstay of treatment in OI, has proven beneficial in increasing bone mass, and to some extent reducing fracture risk. However, the response to treatment is not as robust as is seen in osteoporosis, and it seems less effective in certain types of OI, and in adult OI patients as compared to most pediatric cases. New pharmacological treatments are currently being developed, including anti-resorptive agents, anabolic treatment, and gene- and cell-therapy approaches. These therapies are under different stages of investigation from the bench-side, to pre-clinical and clinical trials. In this review, we will summarize the recent findings regarding the pharmacological and biological strategies for the treatment of patients with OI. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Marom R; Lee YC; Grafe I; Lee B,"American journal of medical genetics.

27549754,"Eosinophils, probiotics, and the microbiome.","There is currently substantial interest in the therapeutic properties of probiotic microorganisms as recent research suggests that oral administration of specific bacterial strains may reduce inflammation and alter the nature of endogenous microflora in the gastrointestinal tract. Eosinophils are multifunctional tissue leukocytes, prominent among the resident cells of the gastrointestinal mucosa that promote local immunity. Recent studies with genetically altered mice indicate that eosinophils not only participate in maintaining gut homeostasis, but that the absence of eosinophils may have significant impact on the nature of the endogenous gut microflora and responses to gut pathogens, notably Clostridium difficile Furthermore, in human subjects, there is an intriguing relationship between eosinophils, allergic inflammation, and the nature of the lung microflora, notably a distinct association between eosinophil infiltration and detection of bacteria of the phylum Actinobacteria. Among topics for future research, it will be important to determine whether homeostatic mechanisms involve direct interactions between eosinophils and bacteria or whether they involve primarily eosinophil-mediated responses to cytokine signaling in the local microenvironment. Likewise, although is it clear that eosinophils can and do interact with bacteria in vivo, their ability to discern between pathogenic and probiotic species in various settings remains to be explored.",Rosenberg HF; Masterson JC; Furuta GT,Journal of leukocyte biology,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27549754/,1,0,0,0,0,0
27170579,Modeling nitrous oxide emission from rivers: a global assessment.,"Estimates of global riverine nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub> O) emissions contain great uncertainty. We conducted a meta-analysis incorporating 169 observations from published literature to estimate global riverine N<sub>2</sub> O emission rates and emission factors. Riverine N<sub>2</sub> O flux was significantly correlated with NH<sub>4</sub> , NO<sub>3</sub> and DIN (NH<sub>4</sub>  + NO<sub>3</sub> ) concentrations, loads and yields. The emission factors EF(a) (i.e., the ratio of N<sub>2</sub> O emission rate and DIN load) and EF(b) (i.e., the ratio of N<sub>2</sub> O and DIN concentrations) values were comparable and showed negative correlations with nitrogen concentration, load and yield and water discharge, but positive correlations with the dissolved organic carbon : DIN ratio. After individually evaluating 82 potential regression models based on EF(a) or EF(b) for global, temperate zone and subtropical zone datasets, a power function of DIN yield multiplied by watershed area was determined to provide the best fit between modeled and observed riverine N<sub>2</sub> O emission rates (EF(a): R<sup>2</sup>  = 0.92 for both global and climatic zone models, n = 70; EF(b): R<sup>2</sup>  = 0.91 for global model and R<sup>2</sup>  = 0.90 for climatic zone models, n = 70). Using recent estimates of DIN loads for 6400 rivers, models estimated global riverine N<sub>2</sub> O emission rates of 29.6-35.3 (mean = 32.2) Gg N<sub>2</sub> O-N yr<sup>-1</sup> and emission factors of 0.16-0.19% (mean = 0.17%). Global riverine N<sub>2</sub> O emission rates are forecasted to increase by 35%, 25%, 18% and 3% in 2050 compared to the 2000s under the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment's Global Orchestration, Order from Strength, Technogarden, and Adapting Mosaic scenarios, respectively. Previous studies may overestimate global riverine N<sub>2</sub> O emission rates (300-2100 Gg N<sub>2</sub> O-N yr<sup>-1</sup> ) because they ignore declining emission factor values with increasing nitrogen levels and channel size, as well as neglect differences in emission factors corresponding to different nitrogen forms. Riverine N<sub>2</sub> O emission estimates will be further enhanced through refining emission factor estimates, extending measurements longitudinally along entire river networks and improving estimates of global riverine nitrogen loads.",Hu M; Chen D; Dahlgren RA,Global change biology,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27170579/,0,0,0,1,0,1
27693347,Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies African-Specific Susceptibility Loci in African Americans With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) cause significant morbidity and are increasing in prevalence among all populations, including African Americans. More than 200 susceptibility loci have been identified in populations of predominantly European ancestry, but few loci have been associated with IBD in other ethnicities. We performed 2 high-density, genome-wide scans comprising 2345 cases of African Americans with IBD (1646 with CD, 583 with UC, and 116 inflammatory bowel disease unclassified) and 5002 individuals without IBD (controls, identified from the Health Retirement Study and Kaiser Permanente database). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated at P < 5.0 × 10<sup>-8</sup> in meta-analysis with a nominal evidence (P < .05) in each scan were considered to have genome-wide significance. We detected SNPs at HLA-DRB1, and African-specific SNPs at ZNF649 and LSAMP, with associations of genome-wide significance for UC. We detected SNPs at USP25 with associations of genome-wide significance for IBD. No associations of genome-wide significance were detected for CD. In addition, 9 genes previously associated with IBD contained SNPs with significant evidence for replication (P < 1.6 × 10<sup>-6</sup>): ADCY3, CXCR6, HLA-DRB1 to HLA-DQA1 (genome-wide significance on conditioning), IL12B,PTGER4, and TNC for IBD; IL23R, PTGER4, and SNX20 (in strong linkage disequilibrium with NOD2) for CD; and KCNQ2 (near TNFRSF6B) for UC. Several of these genes, such as TNC (near TNFSF15), CXCR6, and genes associated with IBD at the HLA locus, contained SNPs with unique association patterns with African-specific alleles. We performed a genome-wide association study of African Americans with IBD and identified loci associated with UC in only this population; we also replicated IBD, CD, and UC loci identified in European populations. The detection of variants associated with IBD risk in only people of African descent demonstrates the importance of studying the genetics of IBD and other complex diseases in populations beyond those of European ancestry.",Brant SR; Okou DT; Simpson CL; Cutler DJ; Haritunians T; Bradfield JP; Chopra P; Prince J; Begum F; Kumar A; Huang C; Venkateswaran S; Datta LW; Wei Z; Thomas K; Herrinton LJ; Klapproth JA; Quiros AJ; Seminerio J; Liu Z; Alexander JS; Baldassano RN; Dudley-Brown S; Cross RK; Dassopoulos T; Denson LA; Dhere TA; Dryden GW; Hanson JS; Hou JK; Hussain SZ; Hyams JS; Isaacs KL; Kader H; Kappelman MD; Katz J; Kellermayer R; Kirschner BS; Kuemmerle JF; Kwon JH; Lazarev M; Li E; Mack D; Mannon P; Moulton DE; Newberry RD; Osuntokun BO; Patel AS; Saeed SA; Targan SR; Valentine JF; Wang MH; Zonca M; Rioux JD; Duerr RH; Silverberg MS; Cho JH; Hakonarson H; Zwick ME; McGovern DP; Kugathasan S,Gastroenterology,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27693347/,0,0,0,1,0,0
27688750,Nutrition and Helicobacter pylori: Host Diet and Nutritional Immunity Influence Bacterial Virulence and Disease Outcome.,"Helicobacter pylori colonizes the stomachs of greater than 50% of the world's human population making it arguably one of the most successful bacterial pathogens. Chronic H. pylori colonization results in gastritis in nearly all patients; however in a subset of people, persistent infection with H. pylori is associated with an increased risk for more severe disease outcomes including B-cell lymphoma of mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma) and invasive adenocarcinoma. Research aimed at elucidating determinants that mediate disease progression has revealed genetic differences in both humans and H. pylori which increase the risk for developing gastric cancer. Furthermore, host diet and nutrition status have been shown to influence H. pylori-associated disease outcomes. In this review we will discuss how H. pylori is able to create a replicative niche within the hostile host environment by subverting and modifying the host-generated immune response as well as successfully competing for limited nutrients such as transition metals by deploying an arsenal of metal acquisition proteins and virulence factors. Lastly, we will discuss how micronutrient availability or alterations in the gastric microbiome may exacerbate negative disease outcomes associated with H. pylori colonization.",Haley KP; Gaddy JA,Gastroenterology research and practice,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27688750/,1,0,0,0,0,0

27544442,Calorie restriction in humans: An update.,"Calorie restriction (CR), a nutritional intervention of reduced energy intake but with adequate nutrition, has been shown to extend healthspan and lifespan in rodent and primate models. Accumulating data from observational and randomized clinical trials indicate that CR in humans results in some of the same metabolic and molecular adaptations that have been shown to improve health and retard the accumulation of molecular damage in animal models of longevity. In particular, moderate CR in humans ameliorates multiple metabolic and hormonal factors that are implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer, the leading causes of morbidity, disability and mortality. In this paper, we will discuss the effects of CR in non-obese humans on these physiological parameters. Special emphasis is committed to recent clinical intervention trials that have investigated the feasibility and effects of CR in young and middle-aged men and women on parameters of energy metabolism and metabolic risk factors of age-associated disease in great detail. Additionally, data from individuals who are either naturally exposed to CR or those who are self-practicing this dietary intervention allows us to speculate on longer-term effects of more severe CR in humans.",Most J; Tosti V; Redman LM; Fontana L,Ageing research reviews,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27544442/,1,0,0,0,0,0

27479025,Giardia: a pathogen or commensal for children in high-prevalence settings?,"Giardia is a common intestinal parasite worldwide, and infection can be associated with clear and sometimes persistent symptomatology. However, in children in high-prevalence settings, it is not associated with or is perhaps even protective against acute diarrhea, and the association with long-term outcomes has been difficult to discern. Recent studies have made progress in helping us disentangle this apparent paradox. First, prospective, well-characterized cohort studies have added to the data on the association between Giardia and diarrhea in these settings and have further characterized associations between Giardia infection and nutrition, gut function, and growth. Second, animal models have further characterized the host response to Giardia and helped elucidate mechanisms by which Giardia could impair child development. Finally, new work has shed light on the heterogeneity of human Giardia strains, which may both explain discrepant findings in the literature and help guide higher-resolution analyses of this pathogen in the future. The true clinical impact of endemic pediatric giardiasis remains unclear, but recent prospective studies have confirmed a high prevalence of persistent, subclinical Giardia infections and associated growth shortfalls. Integrating how nutritional, microbial, metabolic, and pathogen-strain variables influence these outcomes could sharpen delineations between pathogenic and potentially beneficial attributes of this enigmatic parasite.",Bartelt LA; Platts-Mills JA,Current opinion in infectious diseases,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27479025/,1,0,0,0,0,0
27464994,Survival of the Fittest: How Bacterial Pathogens Utilize Bile To Enhance Infection.,"Bacterial pathogens have coevolved with humans in order to efficiently infect, replicate within, and be transmitted to new hosts to ensure survival and a continual infection cycle. For enteric pathogens, the ability to adapt to numerous host factors under the harsh conditions of the gastrointestinal tract is critical for establishing infection. One such host factor readily encountered by enteric bacteria is bile, an innately antimicrobial detergent-like compound essential for digestion and nutrient absorption. Not only have enteric pathogens evolved to resist the bactericidal conditions of bile, but these bacteria also utilize bile as a signal to enhance virulence regulation for efficient infection. This review provides a comprehensive and up-to-date analysis of bile-related research with enteric pathogens. From common responses to the unique expression of specific virulence factors, each pathogen has overcome significant challenges to establish infection in the gastrointestinal tract. Utilization of bile as a signal to modulate virulence factor expression has led to important insights for our understanding of virulence mechanisms for many pathogens. Further research on enteric pathogens exposed to this in vivo signal will benefit therapeutic and vaccine development and ultimately enhance our success at combating such elite pathogens.",Sistrunk JR; Nickerson KP; Chanin RB; Rasko DA; Faherty CS,Clinical microbiology reviews,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27464994/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Major advances in our understanding of the EoE pathophysiology have recently been made, but clinicians struggle with highly unpredictable therapy responses indicative of phenotypic diversity within the patient population. Here, we summarize evidences for the existence of EoE subpopulations based on diverse inflammatory characteristics of the esophageal tissue in EoE. Additionally, clinical characteristics of EoE patients support the concept of disease subtypes. We conclude that clinical and experimental evidences indicate that EoE is an umbrella term for conditions that are unified by esophageal eosinophilia but that several disease subgroups with various inflammatory esophageal patterns and/or different clinical features exist. We further discuss strategies to study the pathophysiologic differences as observed in EoE patients in murine experimental EoE. Going forward, models of EoE that faithfully mimic EoE subentities as defined in humans will be essential because mechanistic studies on triggers which regulate the onset of diverse EoE subpopulations are not feasible in patients. Understanding how and why different EoE phenotypes develop will be a first and fundamental step to establish strategies that integrate individual variations of the EoE pathology into personalized therapy.",Mudde AC; Lexmond WS; Blumberg RS; Nurko S; Fiebiger E,The World Allergy Organization journal,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27458501/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Hand hygiene, line care, and judicious use of indwelling lines are welcome interventions, but might not reduce the incidence of late-onset neonatal bloodstream infections from bacteria originating in the gut. Accumulating data suggest that many pathogens causing late-onset neonatal bloodstream infections are of gut origin, including Gram-positive cocci. In addition to the host-canonical paradigm (i.e., all bacteria have equal risk of invasion and bloodstream infections are functions of variable infant susceptibility), we should now consider bacteria-canonical paradigms, whereby late-onset neonatal bloodstream infection is a function of colonization with a specific subset of bacteria with exceptional invasive potential. In either event, we can no longer be content to reactively approach late-onset neonatal bloodstream infections; instead we need to reduce the occurrences of these infections by broadening our scope of effort beyond line care, and determine the pre-invasive habitat of these pathogens.",Tarr PI; Warner BB,Seminars in fetal & neonatal medicine,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27345372/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Data are now converging on the roles of Gram-negative bacteria as causative agents, despite the dynamic nature of bacterial populations, the varying technologies and sampling strategies, and the overall small sample sizes in these case-control studies. Bacteria that confer protection from necrotizing enterocolitis have not been identified across studies. The beneficial effect of probiotics is not apparent in infants with birth weights <1000 g (these infants are at greatest risk of, and have the highest case fatality rate from, necrotizing enterocolitis).

27333128,Interventions for the Treatment of Aromatase Inhibitor-Associated Arthralgia in Breast Cancer Survivors: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have been established as successful adjuvant therapy for breast cancer survivors. Unfortunately, nearly half of women taking AIs report joint pain, AI-associated arthralgia (AIA). Aromatase inhibitor-associated arthralgia often results in noncompliance, which could lead to cancer recurrence. The purpose of this study was to identify current pain management of AIA and to evaluate the study quality and effects of interventions. Nineteen articles published from 2000 to August 2015 were identified using PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and additional records. Study quality was evaluated by the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. Meta-analysis was used to obtain effect sizes of interventions on pain and subgroups. Five types of interventions emerged: pharmacological approaches, acupuncture, nutritional supplementation, relaxation techniques, and physical exercise. Six studies were strong, 8 were moderate, and 5 were weak in quality. The overall effect size of the interventions on pain was large; pharmacological approaches, acupuncture, and relaxation techniques showed moderate to large effects on pain, whereas nutritional supplementation and physical exercise had no significant effects on it. The evidence was based on a body of research with moderate study quality. Although the overall effect of interventions is large, further investigation into the influence of nutrition and physical exercise is needed to better discern their potential for pain management. Oncology nurses may be able to implement such validated interventions as pain management modalities to mitigate the symptoms so that breast cancer survivors remain compliant with AIA therapy.",Yang GS; Kim HJ; Griffith KA; Zhu S; Dorsey SG; Renn CL,Cancer nursing,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27333128/,0,1,0,1,0,0

Via effects on adipocytes and hepatocytes, immune cells can modulate whole-body metabolism (in metabolic syndromes such as type 2 diabetes and obesity) and, reciprocally, host nutrition and commensal-microbiota-derived metabolites modulate immunological homeostasis. Studies demonstrating the metabolic similarities of proliferating immune cells and cancer cells have helped give birth to the new field of immunometabolism, which focuses on how the cell-intrinsic metabolic properties of lymphocytes and macrophages can themselves dictate the fate and function of the cells and eventually shape an immune response.

27180327,Managing the reproductive performance of beef cows.,"A reproductively efficient beef cow herd will be fundamental to meeting the protein and specifically, red meat demand of an ever increasing global population. However, attaining a high level of reproductive efficiency is underpinned by producers being cognizant of and achieving many key targets throughout the production cycle and requires considerable technical competency. The lifetime productivity of the beef-bred female commences from the onset of puberty and will be dictated by subsequent critical events including age at first calving, duration of the postpartum interval after successive calvings, conception and pregnancy rate, and ultimately manifested as length of intercalving intervals. In calved heifers and mature cows, the onset of ovarian activity, postpartum is a key event dictating the calving interval. Again, this will be the product mainly of prepartum nutrition, manifested through body condition score and the strength of the maternal bond between cow and calf, though there is increasing evidence of a modest genetic influence on this trait. After the initiation of postpartum ovarian cyclicity, conception and subsequent pregnancy rate is generally a function of bull fertility in natural service herds and heat detection and timing of insemination in herds bred through AI. Cows and heifers should be maintained on a steady plane of nutrition during the breeding season, but the contribution of significant excesses or deficiencies of nutrients including protein and trace elements is likely to be minor where adequate pasture is available. Although increased efforts are being made internationally to genetically identify and select for more reproductively efficient beef cows, this is a more long-term strategy and will not replace the need for a high level of technical efficiency and management practice at farm level.",Diskin MG; Kenny DA,Theriogenology,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27180327/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The mechanisms are largely unknown, but epigenetics most likely plays a role. We formed the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics (PACE) consortium and meta-analyzed, across 13 cohorts (n = 6,685), the association between maternal smoking in pregnancy and newborn blood DNA methylation at over 450,000 CpG sites (CpGs) by using the Illumina 450K BeadChip. Over 6,000 CpGs were differentially methylated in relation to maternal smoking at genome-wide statistical significance (false discovery rate, 5%), including 2,965 CpGs corresponding to 2,017 genes not previously related to smoking and methylation in either newborns or adults. Several genes are relevant to diseases that can be caused by maternal smoking (e.g., orofacial clefts and asthma) or adult smoking (e.g., certain cancers). A number of differentially methylated CpGs were associated with gene expression. We observed enrichment in pathways and processes critical to development. In older children (5 cohorts, n = 3,187), 100% of CpGs gave at least nominal levels of significance, far more than expected by chance (p value < 2.2 × 10(-16)). Results were robust to different normalization methods used across studies and cell type adjustment. In this large scale meta-analysis of methylation data, we identified numerous loci involved in response to maternal smoking in pregnancy with persistence into later childhood and provide insights into mechanisms underlying effects of this important exposure.",Joubert BR; Felix JF; Yousefi P; Bakulski KM; Just AC; Breton C; Reese SE; Markunas CA; Richmond RC; Xu CJ; Küpers LK; Oh SS; Hoyo C; Gruzieva O; Söderhäll C; Salas LA; Baïz N; Zhang H; Lepeule J; Ruiz C; Ligthart S; Wang T; Taylor JA; Duijts L; Sharp GC; Jankipersadsing SA; Nilsen RM; Vaez A; Fallin MD; Hu D; Litonjua AA; Fuemmeler BF; Huen K; Kere J; Kull I; Munthe-Kaas MC; Gehring U; Bustamante M; Saurel-Coubizolles MJ; Quraishi BM; Ren J; Tost J; Gonzalez JR; Peters MJ; Håberg SE; Xu Z; van Meurs JB; Gaunt TR; Kerkhof M; Corpeleijn E; Feinberg AP; Eng C; Baccarelli AA; Benjamin Neelon SE; Bradman A; Merid SK; Bergström A; Herceg Z; Hernandez-Vargas H; Brunekreef B; Pinart M; Heude B; Ewart S; Yao J; Lemonnier N; Franco OH; Wu MC; Hofman A; McArdle W; Van der Vlies P; Falahi F; Gillman MW; Barcellos LF; Kumar A; Wickman M; Guerra S; Charles MA; Holloway J; Auffray C; Tiemeier HW; Smith GD; Postma D; Hivert MF; Eskenazi B; Vrijheid M; Arshad H; Antó JM; Dehghan A; Karmaus W; Annesi-Maesano I; Sunyer J; Ghantous A; Pershagen G; Holland N; Murphy SK; DeMeo DL; Burchard EG; Ladd-Acosta C; Snieder H; Nystad W; Koppelman GH; Relton CL; Jaddoe VW; Wilcox A; Melén E; London SJ,American journal of human genetics,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27040690/,0,0,0,1,0,0
27037694,Co-culture-inducible bacteriocin production in lactic acid bacteria.,"It is common knowledge that microorganisms have capabilities, like the production of antimicrobial compounds, which do not normally appear in ideal laboratory conditions. Common antimicrobial discovery techniques require the isolation of monocultures and their individual screening against target microorganisms. One strategy to achieve expression of otherwise hidden antimicrobials is induction by co-cultures. In the area of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria, there has been some research focusing into the characteristics of co-culture-inducible bacteriocin production and particularly the molecular mechanism(s) of such interactions. No clear relationship has been seen between bacteriocin-inducing and bacteriocin-producing microorganisms. The three-component regulatory system seems to be playing a central role in the induction, but inducing compounds have not been identified or characterized. However, the presence of the universal messenger molecule autoinducer-2 has been associated in some cases with the co-culture-inducible bacteriocin phenotype and it may play the role in the additional regulation of the three-component regulatory system. Understanding the mechanisms of induction would facilitate the development of strategies for screening and development of co-culture bacteriocin-producing systems and novel products as well as the perseverance of such systems in food and down to the intestinal tract, possibly conferring a probiotic effect on the host.",Chanos P; Mygind T,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27037694/,1,0,0,0,0,0
26957404,"Noncardiac Challenges in the Cardiac ICU: Feeding, Growth and Gastrointestinal Complications, Anticoagulation, and Analgesia.","Outcomes following cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) admission are influenced by many factors including initial cardiac diagnosis, surgical complexity, and burden of critical illness. Additionally, the presence of noncardiac issues may have a significant impact on outcomes and the patient experience during and following an intensive care unit stay. This review focuses on three common noncardiac areas which impact outcomes and patient experience in and beyond the CICU: feeding and growth, pain and analgesia, and anticoagulation. Growth failure and feeding dysfunction are commonly encountered in infants requiring cardiac surgery and have been associated with worse surgical and developmental outcomes. Recent studies most notably in the single ventricle population have demonstrated improved weight gain and outcomes when feeding protocols are implemented. Children undergoing cardiac surgery may experience both acute and chronic pain. Emerging research is investigating the impact of sedatives and analgesics on neurodevelopmental outcomes and quality of life. Improved pain scores and standardized management of pain and withdrawal may improve the patient experience and outcomes. Effective anticoagulation is a critical component of perioperative care but may be complicated by inflammation, multiorgan dysfunction, and patient factors. Advances in monitoring of anticoagulation and emerging therapies are reviewed.",Hehir DA; Easley RB; Byrnes J,World journal for pediatric & congenital heart surgery,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26957404/,1,0,0,0,0,0
26892966,"Microdomains, Inflammation, and Atherosclerosis.","Elevated levels of cholesteryl ester (CE)-enriched apoB containing plasma lipoproteins lead to increased foam cell formation, the first step in the development of atherosclerosis. Unregulated uptake of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by circulating monocytes and other peripheral blood cells takes place through scavenger receptors and over time causes disruption in cellular cholesterol homeostasis. As lipoproteins are taken up, their CE core is hydrolyzed by liposomal lipases to generate free cholesterol (FC). FC can be either re-esterified and stored as CE droplets or shuttled to the plasma membrane for ATP-binding cassette transporter A1-mediated efflux. Because cholesterol is an essential component of all cellular membranes, some FC may be incorporated into microdomains or lipid rafts. These platforms are essential for receptor signaling and transduction, requiring rapid assembly and disassembly. ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 plays a major role in regulating microdomain cholesterol and is most efficient when lipid-poor apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) packages raft cholesterol into soluble particles that are eventually catabolized by the liver. If FC is not effluxed from the cell, it becomes esterified, CE droplets accumulate and microdomain cholesterol content becomes poorly regulated. This dysregulation leads to prolonged activation of immune cell signaling pathways, resulting in receptor oversensitization. The availability of apoAI or other amphipathic α-helix-rich apoproteins relieves the burden of excess microdomain cholesterol in immune cells allowing a reduction in immune cell proliferation and infiltration, thereby stimulating regression of foam cells in the artery. Therefore, cellular balance between FC and CE is essential for proper immune cell function and prevents chronic immune cell overstimulation and proliferation.",Sorci-Thomas MG; Thomas MJ,Circulation research,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26892966/,1,0,0,0,0,0

26709005,The role of the calcium-sensing receptor in gastrointestinal inflammation.,"The gastrointestinal (GI) tract must balance the extraction of energy and metabolic end-products from ingested nutrition and resident gut microbes and the maintenance of a symbiotic relationship with this microbiota, with the ability to mount functional immune responses to pathogenic organisms to maintain GI health. The gut epithelium is equipped with bacteria-sensing mechanisms that discriminate between pathogenic and commensal microorganisms and regulate host responses between immunity and tolerance. The epithelium also expresses numerous nutrient-sensing receptors, but their importance in the preservation of the gut microbiota and immune homeostasis remains largely unexplored. Observations that a deficiency in the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) using intestinal epithelium-specific receptor knockout mice resulted in diminished intestinal barrier integrity, altered composition of the gut microbiota, modified expression of intestinal pattern recognition receptors, and a skewing of local and systemic innate responses from regulatory to stimulatory, may change the way that this receptor is considered as a potential immunotherapeutic target in gut homeostasis. These findings suggest that pharmacologic CaSR activators and CaSR-based nutrients such as calcium, polyamines, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and oligo-peptides might be useful in conditioning the gut microenvironment, and thus, in the prevention and treatment of disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), infectious enterocolitis, and other inflammatory and secretory diarrheal diseases. Here, we review the emerging roles of the CaSR in intestinal homeostasis and its therapeutic potential for gut pathology.",Owen JL; Cheng SX; Ge Y; Sahay B; Mohamadzadeh M,Seminars in cell & developmental biology,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26709005/,1,0,0,0,0,0
26685124,Proton pump inhibitor-responsive oesophageal eosinophilia: an entity challenging current diagnostic criteria for eosinophilic oesophagitis.,"Consensus diagnostic recommendations to distinguish GORD from eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) by response to a trial of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) unexpectedly uncovered an entity called 'PPI-responsive oesophageal eosinophilia' (PPI-REE). PPI-REE refers to patients with clinical and histological features of EoE that remit with PPI treatment. Recent and evolving evidence, mostly from adults, shows that patients with PPI-REE and patients with EoE at baseline are clinically, endoscopically and histologically indistinguishable and have a significant overlap in terms of features of Th2 immune-mediated inflammation and gene expression. Furthermore, PPI therapy restores oesophageal mucosal integrity, reduces Th2 inflammation and reverses the abnormal gene expression signature in patients with PPI-REE, similar to the effects of topical steroids in patients with EoE. Additionally, recent series have reported that patients with EoE responsive to diet/topical steroids may also achieve remission on PPI therapy. This mounting evidence supports the concept that PPI-REE represents a continuum of the same immunological mechanisms that underlie EoE. Accordingly, it seems counterintuitive to differentiate PPI-REE from EoE based on a differential response to PPI therapy when their phenotypic, molecular, mechanistic and therapeutic features cannot be reliably distinguished. For patients with symptoms and histological features of EoE, it is reasonable to consider PPI therapy not as a diagnostic test, but as a therapeutic agent. Due to its safety profile, ease of administration and high response rates (up to 50%), PPI can be considered a first-line treatment before diet and topical steroids. The reasons why some patients with EoE respond to PPI, while others do not, remain to be elucidated.",Molina-Infante J; Bredenoord AJ; Cheng E; Dellon ES; Furuta GT; Gupta SK; Hirano I; Katzka DA; Moawad FJ; Rothenberg ME; Schoepfer A; Spechler SJ; Wen T; Straumann A; Lucendo AJ,Gut,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26685124/,0,0,0,0,0,0
26628099,"Rhythm and bugs: circadian clocks, gut microbiota, and enteric infections.","To highlight recent developments in understanding the dynamic relationship between circadian rhythms, the gut microbiome, and gastrointestinal infections. In humans and mice, the composition and functions of the intestinal microbiome display diurnal rhythms orchestrated by feeding behaviors and host circadian gene expression. Jet lag, or circadian disruption, perturbs these rhythms to produce gut dysbiosis. When mice are orally infected with Salmonella typhimurium in the morning (the beginning of their rest period) they show higher levels of colonization and gut inflammation vs. infection at other times of day. At the cellular level, recent studies highlight circadian regulation of innate and adaptive gut immunity in coordination with the microbiome, as well as intestinal stem cell growth and regeneration. Taken together, these reports support a key role for circadian rhythms in regulating the gut microbiome and host responses to gastrointestinal pathogens. Further research is needed to translate these findings to improving outcomes for patients with gastrointestinal infections by guiding the right interventions for the right patients at the right time.",Rosselot AE; Hong CI; Moore SR,Current opinion in gastroenterology,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26628099/,1,0,0,0,0,0
26616844,"The Role of Platelet-Activating Factor in Chronic Inflammation, Immune Activation, and Comorbidities Associated with HIV Infection.","With the advent of highly effective antiretroviral therapy, cardiovascular disease has become an important cause of morbidity and mortality among people with treated HIV-1, but the pathogenesis is unclear. Platelet-activating factor is a potent lipid mediator of inflammation that has immunomodulatory effects and a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders and cardiovascular disease. Limited scientific evidence suggests that the platelet-activating factor pathway may be a mechanistic link between HIV-1 infection, systemic inflammation, and immune activation that contribute to pathogenesis of chronic HIV-related comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. In this review, we examine the mechanisms by which the cross-talk between HIV-1, immune dysregulation, inflammation, and perturbations in the platelet-activating factor pathway may directly affect HIV-1 immunopathogenesis. Understanding the role of platelet-activating factor in HIV-1 infection may pave the way for further studies to explore therapeutic interventions, such as diet, that can modify platelet-activating factor activity and use of platelet-activating factor inhibitors that might improve the prognosis of HIV-1 infected patients.",Kelesidis T; Papakonstantinou V; Detopoulou P; Fragopoulou E; Chini M; Lazanas MC; Antonopoulou S,AIDS reviews,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26616844/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The past decade has seen large reductions in global childhood mortality, partly due to expansion of nonspecific public health interventions and vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and rotavirus in LMICs.

26598881,Review of the Effectiveness of the Nutrition Care Process.,"This author (A.I.) has witnessed the introduction of the Nutrition Care Process (NCP) and its subsequent adjustment over 10 y of her career in an acute and critical setting. A.I. observed that the NCP went through several revisions to better suit the actual clinical practices and the NCP was gradually incorporated into everyday work and accepted in a clinical setting. The NCP helped ensure that all practicing registered dietitians (RDs, RDNs) have up-to-date skill sets. The NCP is a systematic problem-solving tool with four distinct and interrelated steps that help RDs to improve critical thinking and address practice-related problems so that RDs can more effectively intervene and evaluate. In summary, RDs using the NCP are producing consistent and easy-to-read documentation of clinical practices that benefit other healthcare members. The intention to provide diagnosis-oriented assessment and to treat nutrition problems with intervention plans opens up opportunities for communication within healthcare teams and clients. The best practice requires interactive and ongoing communication with healthcare teams and clients. The NCP has resulted in improved productivity as the RDs are writing diagnosis- focused documentation with specific plans for intervention. In addition, analysis of common problems and nutrition diagnoses resolution rates appear to be in process in some facilities and may further promote RD roles in practice settings. In conclusion, the NCP is an effective tool to provide improved nutrition care.",Ichimasa A,Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26598881/,1,0,0,0,0,0
26595093,Leishmania vaccine development: exploiting the host-vector-parasite interface.,"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a disease transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies, fatal if untreated, and with no available human vaccine. In rodents, cellular immunity to Leishmania parasite proteins as well as salivary proteins of the sand fly is associated with protection, making them worthy targets for further exploration as vaccines. This review discusses the notion that a combination vaccine including Leishmania and vector salivary antigens may improve vaccine efficacy by targeting the parasite at its most vulnerable stage just after transmission. Furthermore, we put forward the notion that better modeling of natural transmission is needed to test efficacy of vaccines. For example, the fact that individuals living in endemic areas are exposed to sand fly bites and will mount an immune response to salivary proteins should be considered in pre-clinical and clinical evaluation of leishmaniasis vaccines. Nevertheless, despite remaining obstacles there is good reason to be optimistic that safe and effective vaccines against leishmaniasis can be developed.",Reed SG; Coler RN; Mondal D; Kamhawi S; Valenzuela JG,Expert review of vaccines,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26595093/,1,0,0,0,0,0
26590477,Designing a broad-spectrum integrative approach for cancer prevention and treatment.,"Targeted therapies and the consequent adoption of ""personalized"" oncology have achieved notable successes in some cancers; however, significant problems remain with this approach. Many targeted therapies are highly toxic, costs are extremely high, and most patients experience relapse after a few disease-free months. Relapses arise from genetic heterogeneity in tumors, which harbor therapy-resistant immortalized cells that have adopted alternate and compensatory pathways (i.e., pathways that are not reliant upon the same mechanisms as those which have been targeted). To address these limitations, an international task force of 180 scientists was assembled to explore the concept of a low-toxicity ""broad-spectrum"" therapeutic approach that could simultaneously target many key pathways and mechanisms. Using cancer hallmark phenotypes and the tumor microenvironment to account for the various aspects of relevant cancer biology, interdisciplinary teams reviewed each hallmark area and nominated a wide range of high-priority targets (74 in total) that could be modified to improve patient outcomes. For these targets, corresponding low-toxicity therapeutic approaches were then suggested, many of which were phytochemicals. Proposed actions on each target and all of the approaches were further reviewed for known effects on other hallmark areas and the tumor microenvironment. Potential contrary or procarcinogenic effects were found for 3.9% of the relationships between targets and hallmarks, and mixed evidence of complementary and contrary relationships was found for 7.1%. Approximately 67% of the relationships revealed potentially complementary effects, and the remainder had no known relationship. Among the approaches, 1.1% had contrary, 2.8% had mixed and 62.1% had complementary relationships. These results suggest that a broad-spectrum approach should be feasible from a safety standpoint. This novel approach has potential to be relatively inexpensive, it should help us address stages and types of cancer that lack conventional treatment, and it may reduce relapse risks. A proposed agenda for future research is offered.",Block KI; Gyllenhaal C; Lowe L; Amedei A; Amin ARMR; Amin A; Aquilano K; Arbiser J; Arreola A; Arzumanyan A; Ashraf SS; Azmi AS; Benencia F; Bhakta D; Bilsland A; Bishayee A; Blain SW; Block PB; Boosani CS; Carey TE; Carnero A; Carotenuto M; Casey SC; Chakrabarti M; Chaturvedi R; Chen GZ; Chen H; Chen S; Chen YC; Choi BK; Ciriolo MR; Coley HM; Collins AR; Connell M; Crawford S; Curran CS; Dabrosin C; Damia G; Dasgupta S; DeBerardinis RJ; Decker WK; Dhawan P; Diehl AME; Dong JT; Dou QP; Drew JE; Elkord E; El-Rayes B; Feitelson MA; Felsher DW; Ferguson LR; Fimognari C; Firestone GL; Frezza C; Fujii H; Fuster MM; Generali D; Georgakilas AG; Gieseler F; Gilbertson M; Green MF; Grue B; Guha G; Halicka D; Helferich WG; Heneberg P; Hentosh P; Hirschey MD; Hofseth LJ; Holcombe RF; Honoki K; Hsu HY; Huang GS; Jensen LD; Jiang WG; Jones LW; Karpowicz PA; Keith WN; Kerkar SP; Khan GN; Khatami M; Ko YH; Kucuk O; Kulathinal RJ; Kumar NB; Kwon BS; Le A; Lea MA; Lee HY; Lichtor T; Lin LT; Locasale JW; Lokeshwar BL; Longo VD; Lyssiotis CA; MacKenzie KL; Malhotra M; Marino M; Martinez-Chantar ML; Matheu A; Maxwell C; McDonnell E; Meeker AK; Mehrmohamadi M; Mehta K; Michelotti GA; Mohammad RM; Mohammed SI; Morre DJ; Muralidhar V; Muqbil I; Murphy MP; Nagaraju GP; Nahta R; Niccolai E; Nowsheen S; Panis C; Pantano F; Parslow VR; Pawelec G; Pedersen PL; Poore B; Poudyal D; Prakash S; Prince M; Raffaghello L; Rathmell JC; Rathmell WK; Ray SK; Reichrath J; Rezazadeh S; Ribatti D; Ricciardiello L; Robey RB; Rodier F; Rupasinghe HPV; Russo GL; Ryan EP; Samadi AK; Sanchez-Garcia I; Sanders AJ; Santini D; Sarkar M; Sasada T; Saxena NK; Shackelford RE; Shantha Kumara HMC; Sharma D; Shin DM; Sidransky D; Siegelin MD; Signori E; Singh N; Sivanand S; Sliva D; Smythe C; Spagnuolo C; Stafforini DM; Stagg J; Subbarayan PR; Sundin T; Talib WH; Thompson SK; Tran PT; Ungefroren H; Vander Heiden MG; Venkateswaran V; Vinay DS; Vlachostergios PJ; Wang Z; Wellen KE; Whelan RL; Yang ES; Yang H; Yang X; Yaswen P; Yedjou C; Yin X; Zhu J; Zollo M,Seminars in cancer biology,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26590477/,1,0,0,0,0,0
26560096,"Insights into the Role of Chemokines, Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns, and Lymphocyte-Derived Mediators from Computational Models of Trauma-Induced Inflammation.","Traumatic injury elicits a complex, dynamic, multidimensional inflammatory response that is intertwined with complications such as multiple organ dysfunction and nosocomial infection. The complex interplay between inflammation and physiology in critical illness remains a challenge for translational research, including the extrapolation to human disease from animal models. Over the past decade, we and others have attempted to decipher the biocomplexity of inflammation in these settings of acute illness, using computational models to improve clinical translation. In silico modeling has been suggested as a computationally based framework for integrating data derived from basic biology experiments as well as preclinical and clinical studies. Extensive studies in cells, mice, and human blunt trauma patients have led us to suggest (i) that while an adequate level of inflammation is required for healing post-trauma, inflammation can be harmful when it becomes self-sustaining via a damage-associated molecular pattern/Toll-like receptor-driven feed-forward circuit; (ii) that chemokines play a central regulatory role in driving either self-resolving or self-maintaining inflammation that drives the early activation of both classical innate and more recently recognized lymphoid pathways; and (iii) the presence of multiple thresholds and feedback loops, which could significantly affect the propagation of inflammation across multiple body compartments. These insights from data-driven models into the primary drivers and interconnected networks of inflammation have been used to generate mechanistic computational models. Together, these models may be used to gain basic insights as well as serving to help define novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",Namas RA; Mi Q; Namas R; Almahmoud K; Zaaqoq AM; Abdul-Malak O; Azhar N; Day J; Abboud A; Zamora R; Billiar TR; Vodovotz Y,Antioxidants & redox signaling,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26560096/,1,0,0,0,0,0
26552770,Allergic mechanisms of Eosinophilic oesophagitis.,"Eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) is characterized by oesophageal dysfunction and oesophageal eosinophilia refractory to proton-pump-inhibitor treatment. EoE is a food allergy, as elimination of food trigger(s) abrogates the disease, while trigger reintroduction causes recurrence. The allergic mechanism of EoE involves both IgE and non-IgE processes. There is a break in oral tolerance, the immune mechanism allowing enteric exposure to food and micro-organisms without causing deleterious immune responses. Changes in life-style, alterations in gut flora and use of antibiotics may be increasing disease prevalence. Mouse models of EoE and human studies revealed the role of regulatory T-cells and iNKT-cells in the pathogenesis. Th2-cytokines like IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, and other cytokines like TGFβ and TSLP are involved, but perhaps no one cytokine is critically important for driving the disease. Control of EoE may require a pharmaceutical approach that blocks more than one target in the Th2-inflammatory pathway.",Leung J; Beukema KR; Shen AH,Best practice & research.

26515678,Stopping tuberculosis: a biosocial model for sustainable development.,"Tuberculosis transmission and progression are largely driven by social factors such as poor living conditions and poor nutrition. Increased standards of living and social approaches helped to decrease the burden of tuberculosis before the introduction of chemotherapy in the 1940s. Since then, management of tuberculosis has been largely biomedical. More funding for tuberculosis since 2000, coinciding with the Millennium Development Goals, has yielded progress in tuberculosis mortality but smaller reductions in incidence, which continues to pose a risk to sustainable development, especially in poor and susceptible populations. These at-risk populations need accelerated progress to end tuberculosis as resolved by the World Health Assembly in 2015. Effectively addressing the worldwide tuberculosis burden will need not only enhancement of biomedical approaches but also rebuilding of the social approaches of the past. To combine a biosocial approach, underpinned by social, economic, and environmental actions, with new treatments, new diagnostics, and universal health coverage, will need multisectoral coordination and action involving the health and other governmental sectors, as well as participation of the civil society, and especially the poor and susceptible populations. A biosocial approach to stopping tuberculosis will not only target morbidity and mortality from disease but would also contribute substantially to poverty alleviation and sustainable development that promises to meet the needs of the present, especially the poor, and provide them and subsequent generations an opportunity for a better future.",Ortblad KF; Salomon JA; Bärnighausen T; Atun R,"Lancet (London, England)",2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26515678/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The recent advancement in methods identifying microbes has helped implicate the airway microbiome in inflammatory respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD. Such studies support a role of resident microbes in both health and disease of host tissue, especially in the case of inflammatory mucosal diseases. Identifying interactive events between microbes and elements of the immune system can help us to uncover the pathogenic mechanisms underlying CRS.

This inflammation leads to feeding difficulties, failure to thrive and vomiting in young children, and causes food impaction and esophageal stricture in adolescents and adults. In the 20 years since EoE was first described, we have gained a great deal of knowledge regarding the genetic predisposition of disease, the inflammatory milieu associated with EoE and the long-term complications of chronic inflammation. Herein, we summarize the important breakthroughs in the field including both in vitro and in vivo analysis. We discuss insights that we have gained from large-scale unbiased genetic analysis, a multitude of genetically and chemically altered mouse models of EoE and most importantly, the results of clinical trials of various pharmacologic agents.

In this review, we focus on the role of ILCs in mucosal tissues, especially in the gut, in health and disease. ILCs support intestinal homeostasis by protecting the intestine from pathogens, contributing to the development of gut lymphoid tissue, and helping to repair injuries. By cooperating with epithelial cells and other innate and adaptive immune cells, ILCs participate in the control of pathogens and tolerance of commensal bacteria. The development and maintenance of ILCs are influenced by nutrients and metabolites sourced from diet and/or gut bacteria. ILCs have been shown to be involved in host metabolism and to participate in various diseases of the intestine including infectious and chronic inflammatory diseases, and cancer. Thus, the elucidation of ILC biology provides an exciting potential for development of novel therapeutic means to modulate immune responses in various disease settings.",Bostick JW; Zhou L,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26459449/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Food insecurity was found to be associated with increase in risk behaviors, with decreased retention in care and with lower adherence to antiretroviral therapy; fewer studies looked at the role of baseline body weight on outcomes such as mortality. Studies of nutrition interventions had more complex outcomes but improvement in nutritional status was the outcome that was most commonly identified. Nutrition has an important role to play in the current care of HIV-infected individuals and can have an impact on the treatment cascade. Food in security, which may be reversed by the provision of food, is of particular interest as studies suggest associations with multiple outcomes.",Saghayam S; Wanke C,Current opinion in HIV and AIDS,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26444946/,1,0,0,0,0,0
26385073,Pathobiology of Helicobacter pylori-Induced Gastric Cancer.,"Colonization of the human stomach by Helicobacter pylori and its role in causing gastric cancer is one of the richest examples of a complex relationship among human cells, microbes, and their environment. It is also a puzzle of enormous medical importance given the incidence and lethality of gastric cancer worldwide. We review recent findings that have changed how we view these relationships and affected the direction of gastric cancer research. For example, recent data have indicated that subtle mismatches between host and microbe genetic traits greatly affect the risk of gastric cancer. The ability of H pylori and its oncoprotein CagA to reprogram epithelial cells and activate properties of stemness show the sophisticated relationship between H pylori and progenitor cells in the gastric mucosa. The observation that cell-associated H pylori can colonize the gastric glands and directly affect precursor and stem cells supports these observations. The ability to mimic these interactions in human gastric organoid cultures as well as animal models will allow investigators to more fully unravel the extent of H pylori control on the renewing gastric epithelium. Finally, our realization that external environmental factors, such as dietary components and essential micronutrients, as well as the gastrointestinal microbiota, can change the balance between H pylori's activity as a commensal or a pathogen has provided direction to studies aimed at defining the full carcinogenic potential of this organism.",Amieva M; Peek RM,Gastroenterology,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26385073/,1,0,0,0,0,0

26365102,"Does low-energy sweetener consumption affect energy intake and body weight? A systematic review, including meta-analyses, of the evidence from human and animal studies.","By reducing energy density, low-energy sweeteners (LES) might be expected to reduce energy intake (EI) and body weight (BW). To assess the totality of the evidence testing the null hypothesis that LES exposure (versus sugars or unsweetened alternatives) has no effect on EI or BW, we conducted a systematic review of relevant studies in animals and humans consuming LES with ad libitum access to food energy. In 62 of 90 animal studies exposure to LES did not affect or decreased BW. Of 28 reporting increased BW, 19 compared LES with glucose exposure using a specific 'learning' paradigm. Twelve prospective cohort studies in humans reported inconsistent associations between LES use and body mass index (-0.002 kg m(-)(2) per year, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.009 to 0.005). Meta-analysis of short-term randomized controlled trials (129 comparisons) showed reduced total EI for LES versus sugar-sweetened food or beverage consumption before an ad libitum meal (-94 kcal, 95% CI -122 to -66), with no difference versus water (-2 kcal, 95% CI -30 to 26). This was consistent with EI results from sustained intervention randomized controlled trials (10 comparisons). Meta-analysis of sustained intervention randomized controlled trials (4 weeks to 40 months) showed that consumption of LES versus sugar led to relatively reduced BW (nine comparisons; -1.35 kg, 95% CI -2.28 to -0.42), and a similar relative reduction in BW versus water (three comparisons; -1.24 kg, 95% CI -2.22 to -0.26). Most animal studies did not mimic LES consumption by humans, and reverse causation may influence the results of prospective cohort studies. The preponderance of evidence from all human randomized controlled trials indicates that LES do not increase EI or BW, whether compared with caloric or non-caloric (for example, water) control conditions. Overall, the balance of evidence indicates that use of LES in place of sugar, in children and adults, leads to reduced EI and BW, and possibly also when compared with water.",Rogers PJ; Hogenkamp PS; de Graaf C; Higgs S; Lluch A; Ness AR; Penfold C; Perry R; Putz P; Yeomans MR; Mela DJ,International journal of obesity (2005),2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26365102/,0,1,0,1,0,1
26358358,Effect of Fructose on Established Lipid Targets: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Controlled Feeding Trials.,"Debate over the role of fructose in mediating cardiovascular risk remains active. To update the evidence on the effect of fructose on established therapeutic lipid targets for cardiovascular disease (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL]-C, apolipoprotein B, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C]), and metabolic syndrome (triglycerides and HDL-C), we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled feeding trials. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINHAL, and the Cochrane Library were searched through July 7, 2015 for controlled feeding trials with follow-up ≥7 days, which investigated the effect of oral fructose compared to a control carbohydrate on lipids (LDL-C, apolipoprotein B, non-HDL-C, triglycerides, and HDL-C) in participants of all health backgrounds. Two independent reviewers extracted relevant data. Data were pooled using random effects models and expressed as mean difference with 95% CI. Interstudy heterogeneity was assessed (Cochran Q statistic) and quantified (I(2) statistic). Eligibility criteria were met by 51 isocaloric trials (n=943), in which fructose was provided in isocaloric exchange for other carbohydrates, and 8 hypercaloric trials (n=125), in which fructose supplemented control diets with excess calories compared to the control diets alone without the excess calories. Fructose had no effect on LDL-C, non-HDL-C, apolipoprotein B, triglycerides, or HDL-C in isocaloric trials. However, in hypercaloric trials, fructose increased apolipoprotein B (n=2 trials; mean difference = 0.18 mmol/L; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.30; P=0.005) and triglycerides (n=8 trials; mean difference = 0.26 mmol/L; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.41; P<0.001). The study is limited by small sample sizes, limited follow-up, and low quality scores of the included trials. Pooled analyses showed that fructose only had an adverse effect on established lipid targets when added to existing diets so as to provide excess calories (+21% to 35% energy). When isocalorically exchanged for other carbohydrates, fructose had no adverse effects on blood lipids. More trials that are larger, longer, and higher quality are required.

26355214,Frenemies: Signaling and Nutritional Integration in Pathogen-Microbiota-Host Interactions.,"The mammalian gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota is highly adapted to thrive in the GI environment and performs key functions related to host nutrition, physiology, development, immunity, and behavior. Successful host-bacterial associations require chemical signaling and optimal nutrient utilization and exchange. However, this important balance can be severely disrupted by environmental stimuli, with one of the most common insults upon the microbiota being infectious diseases. Although the microbiota acts as a barrier toward enteric pathogens, many enteric pathogens exploit signals and nutrients derived from both the microbiota and host to regulate their virulence programs. Here we review several signaling and nutrient recognition systems employed by GI pathogens to regulate growth and virulence. We discuss how shifts in the microbiota composition change host susceptibility to infection and how dietary changes or manipulation of the microbiota could potentially prevent and/or ameliorate GI infections.",Cameron EA; Sperandio V,Cell host & microbe,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26355214/,1,0,0,0,0,0
26323267,Dysfunctional HDL and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.,"High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) protect against atherosclerosis by removing excess cholesterol from macrophages through the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) pathways involved in reverse cholesterol transport. Factors that impair the availability of functional apolipoproteins or the activities of ABCA1 and ABCG1 could, therefore, strongly influence atherogenesis. HDL also inhibits lipid oxidation, restores endothelial function, exerts anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic actions, and exerts anti-inflammatory actions in animal models. Such properties could contribute considerably to the capacity of HDL to inhibit atherosclerosis. Systemic and vascular inflammation has been proposed to convert HDL to a dysfunctional form that has impaired antiatherogenic effects. A loss of anti-inflammatory and antioxidative proteins, perhaps in combination with a gain of proinflammatory proteins, might be another important component in rendering HDL dysfunctional. The proinflammatory enzyme myeloperoxidase induces both oxidative modification and nitrosylation of specific residues on plasma and arterial apolipoprotein A-I to render HDL dysfunctional, which results in impaired ABCA1 macrophage transport, the activation of inflammatory pathways, and an increased risk of coronary artery disease. Understanding the features of dysfunctional HDL or apolipoprotein A-I in clinical practice might lead to new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to atherosclerosis.",Rosenson RS; Brewer HB; Ansell BJ; Barter P; Chapman MJ; Heinecke JW; Kontush A; Tall AR; Webb NR,Nature reviews.

We performed an inverse χ(2) meta-analysis across ten pediatric-age-of-onset autoimmune diseases (pAIDs) in a case-control study including more than 6,035 cases and 10,718 shared population-based controls. We identified 27 genome-wide significant loci associated with one or more pAIDs, mapping to in silico-replicated autoimmune-associated genes (including IL2RA) and new candidate loci with established immunoregulatory functions such as ADGRL2, TENM3, ANKRD30A, ADCY7 and CD40LG. The pAID-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were functionally enriched for deoxyribonuclease (DNase)-hypersensitivity sites, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), microRNA (miRNA)-binding sites and coding variants. We also identified biologically correlated, pAID-associated candidate gene sets on the basis of immune cell expression profiling and found evidence of genetic sharing.

The latest research in the areas of acute and chronic inflammation and cardiometabolic, gut and cognitive health is presented along with the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying inflammation-health/disease associations. The evidence relating diet composition and early-life nutrition to inflammatory status is reviewed. Human epidemiological and intervention data are thus far heavily reliant on the measurement of inflammatory markers in the circulation, and in particular cytokines in the fasting state, which are recognised as an insensitive and highly variable index of tissue inflammation. Potential novel kinetic and integrated approaches to capture inflammatory status in humans are discussed.

HA is localized in peri-islet and intra-islet regions adjacent to microvessels. HA normally exists in a high molecular weight form, which is anti-inflammatory. However, under inflammatory conditions, HA is degraded into fragments that are proinflammatory. HA accumulates in islets of human subjects with recent onset type 1 diabetes (T1D), and is associated with myeloid and lymphocytic islet infiltration, suggesting a possible role for HA in insulitis. A similar accumulation of HA, in amount and location, occurs in non-obese diabetic (NOD) and DORmO mouse models of T1D. Furthermore, HA accumulates in follicular germinal centers and in T-cell areas in lymph nodes and spleen in both human and mouse models of T1D, as compared with control tissues. Whether HA accumulates in islets in type 2 diabetes (T2D) or models thereof has not been previously described. Here we show evidence that HA accumulates in a mouse model of islet amyloid deposition, a well-known component of islet pathology in T2D.

Using a random-effects model of the twelve studies, the pooled odds ratio (OR) for the risk of LBW comparing the highest versus lowest level of caffeine intake during pregnancy was 1.38 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.73). Linear dose-response analysis showed that every additional 100 mg of caffeine intake (1 cup of coffee or 2 cups of tea) per day during pregnancy was associated with a 3.0% increase in OR for LBW. There was a moderate level of overall heterogeneity with an I-squared value of 55% (95% CI: 13, 76%), and no evidence of publication bias based on Egger's test (P = 0.20) and the funnel plot.

To deal with these hostile environments, pathogenic bacteria have evolved or acquired virulence determinants that aid in the acquisition of nutrients. This connection between pathogenesis and nutrition may explain why regulators of metabolism in nonpathogenic bacteria are used by pathogenic bacteria to regulate both metabolism and virulence. Such coordinated regulation is presumably advantageous because it conserves carbon and energy by aligning synthesis of virulence determinants with the nutritional environment. In Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, at least three metabolite-responsive global regulators, CcpA, CodY, and Rex, have been shown to coordinate the expression of metabolism and virulence genes.

A cell-bound IgE pool is formed when monomeric IgE binds to FcɛRI, the high affinity IgE Fc receptor on these cells, and minor amounts of antigen are sufficient to trigger the pro-allergic innate IgE effector axis. Additionally, FcɛRI is constitutively expressed on human dendritic cells (DCs), and thus the latter cell type also receives signals via cell-bound IgE. Notably, steady-state expression of FcɛRI on DCs is absent in SPF-housed mice. How DCs integrate IgE/FcɛRI-derived signals into their sentinel functions as gatekeepers of immunity was therefore only recently studied with transgenic mice that phenocopy human FcɛRI expression. In this review, we summarize advances in our understanding of the functions of DC-bound IgE which demonstrate that IgE-mediated activation of DCs in allergic Th2-type inflammation appears to be immune regulatory rather than pro-inflammatory.",Platzer B; Stout M; Fiebiger E,Molecular immunology,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26052071/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Enteric nutrition formulas supplemented with transforming growth factor β, a milk cytokine, have been shown to promote remission in pediatric Crohn's disease. A number of milk glycans, including human milk oligosaccharides, show promise in preclinical studies as antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory agents. While active preclinical investigations of human milk may soon result in large-scale production of human milk molecules, bovine milk components in many instances represent a practical source of bioactive milk compounds for use in clinical trials. This review summarizes current efforts to translate the compounds derived from human and bovine milk into effective clinical therapies. These efforts suggest a common pathway for the translation of milk-derived compounds into clinical applications.",Hill DR; Newburg DS,Nutrition reviews,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26011900/,1,0,0,0,0,0
26009596,Familial hypercholesterolaemia in children and adolescents: gaining decades of life by optimizing detection and treatment.,"Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a common genetic cause of premature coronary heart disease (CHD). Globally, one baby is born with FH every minute. If diagnosed and treated early in childhood, individuals with FH can have normal life expectancy. This consensus paper aims to improve awareness of the need for early detection and management of FH children. Familial hypercholesterolaemia is diagnosed either on phenotypic criteria, i.e. an elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level plus a family history of elevated LDL-C, premature coronary artery disease and/or genetic diagnosis, or positive genetic testing. Childhood is the optimal period for discrimination between FH and non-FH using LDL-C screening. An LDL-C ≥5 mmol/L (190 mg/dL), or an LDL-C ≥4 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) with family history of premature CHD and/or high baseline cholesterol in one parent, make the phenotypic diagnosis. If a parent has a genetic defect, the LDL-C cut-off for the child is ≥3.5 mmol/L (130 mg/dL). We recommend cascade screening of families using a combined phenotypic and genotypic strategy. In children, testing is recommended from age 5 years, or earlier if homozygous FH is suspected. A healthy lifestyle and statin treatment (from age 8 to 10 years) are the cornerstones of management of heterozygous FH. Target LDL-C is <3.5 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) if >10 years, or ideally 50% reduction from baseline if 8-10 years, especially with very high LDL-C, elevated lipoprotein(a), a family history of premature CHD or other cardiovascular risk factors, balanced against the long-term risk of treatment side effects. Identifying FH early and optimally lowering LDL-C over the lifespan reduces cumulative LDL-C burden and offers health and socioeconomic benefits. To drive policy change for timely detection and management, we call for further studies in the young. Increased awareness, early identification, and optimal treatment from childhood are critical to adding decades of healthy life for children and adolescents with FH.",Wiegman A; Gidding SS; Watts GF; Chapman MJ; Ginsberg HN; Cuchel M; Ose L; Averna M; Boileau C; Borén J; Bruckert E; Catapano AL; Defesche JC; Descamps OS; Hegele RA; Hovingh GK; Humphries SE; Kovanen PT; Kuivenhoven JA; Masana L; Nordestgaard BG; Pajukanta P; Parhofer KG; Raal FJ; Ray KK; Santos RD; Stalenhoef AF; Steinhagen-Thiessen E; Stroes ES; Taskinen MR; Tybjærg-Hansen A; Wiklund O,European heart journal,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26009596/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25998294,Evidence-informed clinical practice recommendations for treatment of type 1 diabetes complicated by problematic hypoglycemia.,"Problematic hypoglycemia, defined as two or more episodes per year of severe hypoglycemia or as one episode associated with impaired awareness of hypoglycemia, extreme glycemic lability, or major fear and maladaptive behavior, is a challenge, especially for patients with long-standing type 1 diabetes. Individualized therapy for such patients should include a composite target: optimal glucose control without problematic hypoglycemia. Therefore, we propose a tiered, four-stage algorithm based on evidence of efficacy given the limitations of educational, technological, and transplant interventions. All patients with problematic hypoglycemia should undergo structured or hypoglycemia-specific education programs (stage 1). Glycemic and hypoglycemia treatment targets should be individualized and reassessed every 3-6 months. If targets are not met, one diabetes technology-continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion or continuous glucose monitoring-should be added (stage 2). For patients with continued problematic hypoglycemia despite education (stage 1) and one diabetes technology (stage 2), sensor-augmented insulin pumps preferably with an automated low-glucose suspend feature and/or very frequent contact with a specialized hypoglycemia service can reduce hypoglycemia (stage 3). For patients whose problematic hypoglycemia persists, islet or pancreas transplant should be considered (stage 4). This algorithm provides an evidence-informed approach to resolving problematic hypoglycemia; it should be used as a guide, with individual patient circumstances directing suitability and acceptability to ensure the prudent use of technology and scarce transplant resources. Standardized reporting of hypoglycemia outcomes and inclusion of patients with problematic hypoglycemia in studies of new interventions may help to guide future therapeutic strategies.",Choudhary P; Rickels MR; Senior PA; Vantyghem MC; Maffi P; Kay TW; Keymeulen B; Inagaki N; Saudek F; Lehmann R; Hering BJ,Diabetes care,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25998294/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25895007,Very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease: gaining insight through focused discovery.,"The pathogenesis of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is only partially understood. Strong evidence implicates a strong genetic component including high monozygotic twin concordance and familial disease phenotype concordance rates. Genome-wide association studies have identified associations between >160 genetic loci and the risk for developing IBD. The roles of implicated genes are largely immune-mediated, although other functions include cellular migration, oxidative stress, and carbohydrate metabolism. Additionally, growing literature describes monogenic causes of IBD that frequently present as infantile or very early-onset IBD. The interplay between IBD risk single nucleotide polymorphisms and rare genetic variants has yet to be determined. Studying patients with very early-onset IBD may elicit genetic factors that could be applied to broader populations of IBD. This review describes what is known about the genetic causes of very early-onset IBD and genetic strategies that may unravel more of the genetic causes of IBD.",Moran CJ; Klein C; Muise AM; Snapper SB,Inflammatory bowel diseases,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25895007/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25838898,Current strategies for reproductive management of gilts and sows in North America.,"Many advances in genetic selection, nutrition, housing and disease control have been incorporated into modern pork production since the 1950s resulting in highly prolific females and practices and technologies, which significantly increased efficiency of reproduction in the breeding herd. The objective of this manuscript is to review the literature and current industry practices employed for reproductive management. In particular the authors focus on assisted reproduction technologies and their application for enhanced productivity. Modern maternal line genotypes have lower appetites and exceptional lean growth potential compared to females of 20 yr ago. Thus, nutrient requirements and management techniques and technologies, which affect gilt development and sow longevity, require continuous updating. Failure to detect estrus accurately has the greatest impact on farrowing rate and litter size. Yet, even accurate estrus detection will not compensate for the variability in the interval between onset of estrus and actual time of ovulation. However, administration of GnRH analogs in weaned sows and in gilts after withdrawal of altrenogest do overcome this variability and thereby synchronize ovulation, which makes fixed-time AI practical. Seasonal infertility, mediated by temperature and photoperiod, is a persistent problem. Training workers in the art of stockmanship is of increasing importance as consumers become more interested in humane animal care. Altrenogest, is used to synchronize the estrous cycle of gilts, to prolong gestation for 2-3 d to synchronize farrowing and to postpone post-weaning estrus. P.G. 600® is used for induction of estrus in pre-pubertal gilts and as a treatment to overcome seasonal anestrous. Sperm cell numbers/dose of semen is significantly less for post cervical AI than for cervical AI. Real-time ultrasonography is used to determine pregnancy during wk 3-5. PGF2α effectively induces farrowing when administered within two d of normal gestation length. Ovulation synchronization, single fixed-time AI and induced parturition may lead to farrowing synchronization, which facilitates supervision and reduces stillbirths and piglet mortality. Attendance and assistance at farrowing is important especially to ensure adequate colostrum consumption by piglets immediately after birth. New performance terminologies are presented.",Kraeling RR; Webel SK,Journal of animal science and biotechnology,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25838898/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25833893,Inflammation and Nutritional Science for Programs/Policies and Interpretation of Research Evidence (INSPIRE).,"An increasing recognition has emerged of the complexities of the global health agenda—specifically, the collision of infections and noncommunicable diseases and the dual burden of over- and undernutrition. Of particular practical concern are both 1) the need for a better understanding of the bidirectional relations between nutritional status and the development and function of the immune and inflammatory response and 2) the specific impact of the inflammatory response on the selection, use, and interpretation of nutrient biomarkers. The goal of the Inflammation and Nutritional Science for Programs/Policies and Interpretation of Research Evidence (INSPIRE) is to provide guidance for those users represented by the global food and nutrition enterprise. These include researchers (bench and clinical), clinicians providing care/treatment, those developing and evaluating programs/interventions at scale, and those responsible for generating evidence-based policy. The INSPIRE process included convening 5 thematic working groups (WGs) charged with developing summary reports around the following issues: 1) basic overview of the interactions between nutrition, immune function, and the inflammatory response; 2) examination of the evidence regarding the impact of nutrition on immune function and inflammation; 3) evaluation of the impact of inflammation and clinical conditions (acute and chronic) on nutrition; 4) examination of existing and potential new approaches to account for the impact of inflammation on biomarker interpretation and use; and 5) the presentation of new approaches to the study of these relations. Each WG was tasked with synthesizing a summary of the evidence for each of these topics and delineating the remaining gaps in our knowledge.

This review examines data on nutrition assessment, counseling, and support interventions in resource-limited settings. We identified articles published between 2005 and 2014 on the effectiveness of nutrition assessment, counseling, and support interventions, particularly its impact on 5 outcomes: mortality, morbidity, retention in care, quality of life, and/or prevention of ongoing HIV transmission. We rated the overall quality of individual articles and summarized the body of evidence and expected impact for each outcome. Twenty-one articles met all inclusion criteria. The overall quality of evidence was weak, predominantly because of few studies being designed to directly address the question of interest. Only 2 studies were randomized trials with no food support control groups. The remainder were randomized studies of one type of food support versus another, cohort (nonrandomized) studies, or single-arm studies. Ratings of individual study quality ranged from ""medium"" to ""weak,"" and the quality of the overall body of evidence ranged from ""fair"" to ""poor."" We rated the expected impact on all outcomes as ""uncertain."" Rigorous better designed studies in resource-limited settings are urgently needed to understand the effectiveness of nutrition assessment and counseling alone, as well as studies to understand better modalities of food support (targeting, timing, composition, form, and duration) to improve both short- and long-term patient retention in care and treatment, and clinical outcomes.",Tang AM; Quick T; Chung M; Wanke CA,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999),2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25768873/,0,1,0,0,0,0

The review used PubMed searches of current literature to examine adipose tissue leukocytosis. The adipose tissue of obese subjects becomes inflamed and contributes to the development of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Numerous immune cells including B cells, T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils have been identified in adipose tissue, and obesity influences both the quantity and the nature of immune cell subtypes, which emerges as an active immunological organ capable of modifying whole-body metabolism through paracrine and endocrine mechanisms. Adipose tissue is a large immunologically active organ during obesity and displays hallmarks of both and innate and adaptive immune response. Despite the presence of hematopoietic lineage cells in adipose tissue, it is unclear whether the adipose compartment has a direct role in immune surveillance or host defense. Understanding the interactions between leukocytes and adipocytes may reveal the clinically relevant pathways that control adipose tissue inflammation and is likely to reveal mechanisms by which obesity contributes to increased susceptibility to both metabolic and certain infectious diseases.",Grant RW; Dixit VD,"Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)",2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25612251/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25591052,Analyzing B-vitamins in Human Milk: Methodological Approaches.,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life. However, there is insufficient information about the concentration of nutrients in human milk. For some nutrients, including B-vitamins, maternal intake affects their concentration in human milk but the extent to which inadequate maternal diets affect milk B-vitamin content is poorly documented. Little is known about infant requirements for B-vitamins; recommendations are generally set as Adequate Intakes (AI) calculated on the basis of the mean volume of milk (0.78 L/day) consumed by infants exclusively fed with human milk from well-nourished mothers during the first six months, and the concentration of each vitamin in milk based on reported values. Methods used for analyzing B-vitamins, commonly microbiological, radioisotope dilution or more recently chromatographic, coupled with UV, fluorometric and MS detection, have rarely been validated for the complex human milk matrix. Thus the validity, accuracy, and sensitivity of analytical methods is important for understanding infant requirements for these nutrients, the maternal intakes needed to support adequate concentrations in breast milk. This review summarizes current knowledge on methods used for analyzing the B-vitamins thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B-6 and pantothenic acid, vitamin B-12, folate, biotin, and choline in human milk, their chemical and physical properties, the different forms and changes in concentration during lactation, and the effects of deficiency on the infant.",Hampel D; Allen LH,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25591052/,1,0,0,0,0,0

25563988,T-cell energy metabolism as a controller of cell fate in transplantation.,"To highlight some of the recent developments in the novel field of immunometabolism and the therapeutic potential of the many regulatory components of this immunometabolic network for transplantation. In response to cytokines, changes in nutrients, and other alterations in the local milieu, immune cells are capable of changing their internal metabolic pathways to meet their energy demands. Recent studies demonstrate that activated T effectors (Th1 and Th17) are supported by aerobic glycolysis, whereas regulatory T cells and CD8 memory T cells favor fatty acid oxidation and lipid biosynthesis through mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. These bioenergetic processes are dependent upon the activation of metabolic sensors such as mammalian target of rapamycin and AMP-activated protein kinase, respectively, indicating that the cross-talk between immunity and metabolism can shape the fate and function of immune cells. Finally, exciting new studies suggest that differences in the bioenergetic mechanisms within the various immune subsets may selectively be exploited for regulating the immune responses. In this review, we will discuss the metabolic signatures adopted by various immune cells during tolerance versus immunity and the promising avenues that can be modulated by targeting metabolic pathways with either nutrition or pharmacological intervention for establishing long-term transplantation tolerance.",Priyadharshini B; Turka LA,Current opinion in organ transplantation,2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25563988/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The natural microbiota of insect vectors influences various aspects of host biology, such as nutrition, reproduction, metabolism, and immunity, and recent studies have highlighted the ability of insect-associated bacteria to reduce vector competence for arboviruses and other pathogens.

Those who survive frequently suffer from long-term sequelae including growth failure and neurodevelopmental impairment. Malnutrition is part of a vicious cycle of impaired immunity, recurrent infections, and worsening malnutrition. Recently, alterations in the gut microbiome have also been strongly implicated in childhood malnutrition. It has been suggested that malnutrition may delay the normal development of the gut microbiota in early childhood or force it toward an altered composition that lacks the required functions for healthy growth and/or increases the risk for intestinal inflammation. This review addresses our current understanding of the beneficial contributions of gut microbiota to human nutrition (and conversely the potential role of changes in that community to malnutrition), the process of acquiring an intestinal microbiome, potential influences of malnutrition on the developing microbiota, and the evidence directly linking alterations in the intestinal microbiome to childhood malnutrition. We review recent studies on the association between alterations in the intestinal microbiome and early childhood malnutrition and discuss them in the context of implications for intervention or prevention of the devastation caused by malnutrition.",Kane AV; Dinh DM; Ward HD,Pediatric research,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25356748/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with no limitation of publication type or language. Participants were cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Trial designs included comparisons of CHM with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, supportive treatments for leucopenia, and/or placebo. Main outcomes were white blood cell count and incidence of leucopenia. Screening, data extraction, and analysis were conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. Eighty-three RCTs (n = 8,012) met the inclusion criteria. Fifteen Chinese patent medicines and 47 different modified formulas were used as prophylaxis for chemotherapy-induced leucopenia. Compared with no treatment, CHMs were shown to decrease the incidence of leucopenia (odds ratio (OR) -0.23 [-0.20, -0.27]), P < 0.00001), with the number needed to treat (NNT) -3.45 [-3.13, -3.85]. Subgroup analysis suggested a prophylactic benefit for white blood cell counts with Fufang E-jiao Jiang, Diyu Shengbai Pian, combination Huangqi and Shengmai Zhusheye, and Fuzhong Shengbai Fang for patients undergoing chemotherapy. No serious adverse events were reported. Only three articles (3/83, 4 %) were rated as having adequate methodological quality with a low level of bias. Funnel plots were asymmetrical. Some CHMs may be efficacious in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced leucopenia, but the majority of reviewed studies were of poor quality. Results need to be confirmed in rigorously conducted high-quality trials, including pharmacokinetic studies to ensure that there are no interactions between the CHM agent and chemotherapy.",Ma LX; Ai P; Li H; Vardy J,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25339619/,0,1,0,1,0,0

25201040,Diet and host-microbial crosstalk in postnatal intestinal immune homeostasis.,"Neonates face unique challenges in the period following birth. The postnatal immune system is in the early stages of development and has a range of functional capabilities that are distinct from the mature adult immune system. Bidirectional immune-microbial interactions regulate the development of mucosal immunity and alter the composition of the microbiota, which contributes to overall host well-being. In the past few years, nutrition has been highlighted as a third element in this interaction that governs host health by modulating microbial composition and the function of the immune system. Dietary changes and imbalances can disturb the immune-microbiota homeostasis, which might alter susceptibility to several autoimmune and metabolic diseases. Major changes in cultural traditions, socioeconomic status and agriculture are affecting the nutritional status of humans worldwide, which is altering core intestinal microbial communities. This phenomenon is especially relevant to the neonatal and paediatric populations, in which the microbiota and immune system are extremely sensitive to dietary influences.

25128212,Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adrenal insufficiency in the adult.,"Adrenal insufficiency (AI) is a disease characterized by a deficient production or action of glucocorticoids, with or without deficiency in mineral corticoids and/or adrenal androgens. It can result from disease intrinsic to the adrenal cortex (primary AI), from pituitary diseases that hamper the release of corticotropin (secondary AI) or from hypothalamic disorders that impair the secretion of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (tertiary AI). It is a disease with a low prevalence but its impact on the affected individual is very high as it can be life-threathening if not treated or lead to health problems if inadequately treated. However, currently there are no specific guidelines for the management of this disease. Therefore, at the proposal of the Spanish Society of Endocrinology and Nutrition (SEEN) board, a task-force under the Neuroendocrinology Knowledge Area of the SEEN was established, with the mandate of updating the diagnosis and treatment of AI. In fulfilment of this mandate the task-force has elaborated the present guide that, based on a comprehensive review of literature, is intended to provide an answer to questions related to the management of this disease.

25121497,Schistosome feeding and regurgitation.,"Schistosomes are parasitic flatworms that infect >200 million people worldwide, causing the chronic, debilitating disease schistosomiasis. Unusual among parasitic helminths, the long-lived adult worms, continuously bathed in blood, take up nutrients directly across the body surface and also by ingestion of blood into the gut. Recent proteomic analyses of the body surface revealed the presence of hydrolytic enzymes, solute, and ion transporters, thus emphasising its metabolic credentials. Furthermore, definition of the molecular mechanisms for the uptake of selected metabolites (glucose, certain amino acids, and water) establishes it as a vital site of nutrient acquisition. Nevertheless, the amount of blood ingested into the gut per day is considerable: for males ∼100 nl; for the more actively feeding females ∼900 nl, >4 times body volume. Ingested erythrocytes are lysed as they pass through the specialized esophagus, while leucocytes become tethered and disabled there. Proteomics and transcriptomics have revealed, in addition to gut proteases, an amino acid transporter in gut tissue and other hydrolases, ion, and lipid transporters in the lumen, implicating the gut as the site for acquisition of essential lipids and inorganic ions. The surface is the principal entry route for glucose, whereas the gut dominates amino acid acquisition, especially in females. Heme, a potentially toxic hemoglobin degradation product, accumulates in the gut and, since schistosomes lack an anus, must be expelled by the poorly understood process of regurgitation. Here we place the new observations on the proteome of body surface and gut, and the entry of different nutrient classes into schistosomes, into the context of older studies on worm composition and metabolism. We suggest that the balance between surface and gut in nutrition is determined by the constraints of solute diffusion imposed by differences in male and female worm morphology. Our conclusions have major implications for worm survival under immunological or pharmacological pressure.",Skelly PJ; Da'dara AA; Li XH; Castro-Borges W; Wilson RA,PLoS pathogens,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25121497/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25092518,Vitamin D supplementation and antibacterial immune responses in adolescents and young adults with HIV/AIDS.,"Human monocytes activated by toll-like receptor 2/1 ligand (TLR2/1L) show enhanced expression of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the vitamin D-activating enzyme 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1). The resulting intracrine conversion of precursor 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD) to active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) can stimulate expression of antibacterial cathelicidin (CAMP). To determine whether this response is functional in HIV-infected subjects (HIV+ ), serum from HIV+ subjects pre- and post-vitamin D supplementation was utilized in monocyte cultures with or without TLR2/1L. Expression of CYP27B1 and VDR was enhanced following treatment with TLR2/1L, although this effect was lower in HIV+ vs HIV- serum (p<0.05). CAMP was also lower in TLR2/1L-treated monocytes cultured in HIV+ serum (p<0.01). In a dose study, supplementation of HIV+ subjects with 4000IU or 7000IU vitamin D/day increased serum 25OHD from 17.3±8.0 and 20.6±6.2ng/ml (43nM and 51nM) at baseline to 41.1±12.0 and 51.9±23.1ng/ml (103nM and 130nM) after 12 weeks (both p<0.001). Greater percent change from baseline 25OHD was significantly associated with enhanced TLR2/1L-induced monocyte CAMP adjusted for baseline expression (p=0.009). In a randomized placebo-controlled trial, 7000IU vitamin D/day increased serum 25OHD from 18.0±8.6 to 32.7±13.8ng/ml (45nM and 82nM) after 12 weeks. Expression of CAMP increased significantly from baseline after 52 weeks of vitamin D-supplementation. At this time point, TLR2/1L-induced CAMP was positively associated with percent change from baseline in 25OHD (p=0.029 overall and 0.002 within vitamin D-supplemented only). These data indicate that vitamin D supplementation in HIV-infected subjects can promote improved antibacterial immunity, but also suggest that longer periods of supplementation are required to achieve this.",Chun RF; Liu NQ; Lee T; Schall JI; Denburg MR; Rutstein RM; Adams JS; Zemel BS; Stallings VA; Hewison M,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25092518/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25070675,Digesting the emerging role for the gut microbiome in central nervous system demyelination.,"The fields of microbiology, immunology, neurology and nutrition are rapidly converging, as advanced sequencing and genomics-based methodologies have enabled the mapping out of the microbial diversity of humans for the first time. Bugs, guts, brains and behavior were once believed to be separate domains of clinical practice and research; however, recent observations in our understanding of the microbiome indicate that the boundaries between domains are becoming permeable. This permeability is multidirectional: Biological systems are operating simultaneously in a vastly complex and interconnected web. Understanding the microbiome-gut-brain axis will entail fleshing out the mechanisms by which transduction across each domain occurs, allowing us ultimately to appreciate the role of commensal organisms in shaping and modulating host immunity. This article will highlight animal and human research to date, as well as highlight directions for future research. We speculate that the gut microbiome is potentially the premier environmental risk factor mediating inflammatory central nervous system demyelination, in particular multiple sclerosis.",Joscelyn J; Kasper LH,"Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)",2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25070675/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25058236,The diagnostic approach to monogenic very early onset inflammatory bowel disease.,"Patients with a diverse spectrum of rare genetic disorders can present with inflammatory bowel disease (monogenic IBD). Patients with these disorders often develop symptoms during infancy or early childhood, along with endoscopic or histological features of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or IBD unclassified. Defects in interleukin-10 signaling have a Mendelian inheritance pattern with complete penetrance of intestinal inflammation. Several genetic defects that disturb intestinal epithelial barrier function or affect innate and adaptive immune function have incomplete penetrance of the IBD-like phenotype. Several of these monogenic conditions do not respond to conventional therapy and are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Due to the broad spectrum of these extremely rare diseases, a correct diagnosis is frequently a challenge and often delayed. In many cases, these diseases cannot be categorized based on standard histological and immunologic features of IBD. Genetic analysis is required to identify the cause of the disorder and offer the patient appropriate treatment options, which include medical therapy, surgery, or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In addition, diagnosis based on genetic analysis can lead to genetic counseling for family members of patients. We describe key intestinal, extraintestinal, and laboratory features of 50 genetic variants associated with IBD-like intestinal inflammation. In addition, we provide approaches for identifying patients likely to have these disorders. We also discuss classic approaches to identify these variants in patients, starting with phenotypic and functional assessments that lead to analysis of candidate genes. As a complementary approach, we discuss parallel genetic screening using next-generation sequencing followed by functional confirmation of genetic defects.",Uhlig HH; Schwerd T; Koletzko S; Shah N; Kammermeier J; Elkadri A; Ouahed J; Wilson DC; Travis SP; Turner D; Klein C; Snapper SB; Muise AM,Gastroenterology,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25058236/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25049059,"Should bioactive trace elements not recognized as essential, but with beneficial health effects, have intake recommendations.","Today, most nutritionists do not consider a trace element essential unless it has a defined biochemical function in higher animals or humans. As a result, even though it has been found that trace elements such as boron and silicon have beneficial bioactivity in higher animals and humans, they generally receive limited attention or mention when dietary guidelines or intake recommendations are formulated. Recently, the possibility of providing dietary intake recommendations such as an adequate intake (AI) for some bioactive food components (e.g., flavonoids) has been discussed. Boron, chromium, nickel, and silicon are bioactive food components that provide beneficial health effects by plausible mechanisms of action in nutritional and supra nutritional amounts, and thus should be included in the discussions. Although the science base may not be considered adequate for establishing AIs, a significant number of findings suggest that statements about these trace elements should be included when dietary intake guidance is formulated. An appropriate recommendation may be that diets should include foods that would provide trace elements not currently recognized as essential in amounts shown to reduce the risk of chronic disease and/or promote health and well-being.",Nielsen FH,Journal of trace elements in medicine and biology : organ of the Society for Minerals and Trace Elements (GMS),2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25049059/,1,0,0,0,0,0
25024897,"Diminished brain resilience syndrome: A modern day neurological pathology of increased susceptibility to mild brain trauma, concussion, and downstream neurodegeneration.","The number of sports-related concussions has been steadily rising in recent years. Diminished brain resilience syndrome is a term coined by the lead author to describe a particular physiological state of nutrient functional deficiency and disrupted homeostatic mechanisms leading to increased susceptibility to previously considered innocuous concussion. We discuss how modern day environmental toxicant exposure, along with major changes in our food supply and lifestyle practices, profoundly reduce the bioavailability of neuro-critical nutrients such that the normal processes of homeostatic balance and resilience are no longer functional. Their diminished capacity triggers physiological and biochemical 'work around' processes that result in undesirable downstream consequences. Exposure to certain environmental chemicals, particularly glyphosate, the active ingredient in the herbicide, Roundup(®), may disrupt the body's innate switching mechanism, which normally turns off the immune response to brain injury once danger has been removed. Deficiencies in serotonin, due to disruption of the shikimate pathway, may lead to impaired melatonin supply, which reduces the resiliency of the brain through reduced antioxidant capacity and alterations in the cerebrospinal fluid, reducing critical protective buffering mechanisms in impact trauma. Depletion of certain rare minerals, overuse of sunscreen and/or overprotection from sun exposure, as well as overindulgence in heavily processed, nutrient deficient foods, further compromise the brain's resilience. Modifications to lifestyle practices, if widely implemented, could significantly reduce this trend of neurological damage.",Morley WA; Seneff S,Surgical neurology international,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25024897/,1,0,0,0,0,0

New diagnostic modalities and carefully designed field studies are demonstrating that the burden of Campylobacter diarrhea in children in the developing world has been greatly underestimated. Furthermore, there is emerging recognition of an association between Campylobacter infection and malnutrition. Important progress has been made toward a Campylobacter jejuni vaccine. Finally, evidence of antibiotic resistance continues to be an important issue that is accentuated by the realization that the burden of disease is greater than previously recognized. Additional research is needed to refine our understanding of the epidemiology of Campylobacter infections in developing countries, in particular to improve estimates of the burden of Campylobacter diarrhea in endemic settings, to determine the impact of recurrent Campylobacter infections on child development, and to describe the prevalence and clinical significance of non-jejuni/coli Campylobacter infections. Progressive antibiotic resistance of isolates argues for augmented and expanded control measures of antibiotics in livestock. Continued work in vaccine development is warranted as is the extension of data available on the serotypes related to burden in different areas of the world and the relationship of serotypes to disease severity.",Platts-Mills JA; Kosek M,Current opinion in infectious diseases,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25023741/,1,0,0,0,0,0

To inform the expansion of HCV-related public health efforts in RI, and because surveillance data are lacking and national surveys, including the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), likely underestimate true HCV prevalence, we reviewed published peer-reviewed and grey literature to more accurately estimate the prevalence of HCV in RI. The results of our review suggest that between 16,603 and 22,660 (1.7%-2.3%) persons in RI have ever been infected with HCV. Assuming a spontaneous clearance rate of 26%, we estimate that between 12,286 and 16,768 (1.2%-1.7%) have ever been or are currently chronically infected with HCV. Findings suggest the urgent need for improved HCV screening in RI, and that reducing morbidity and mortality from HCV will require a dramatic scale-up of testing, linkage to care, treatment and cure.",Kinnard EN; Taylor LE; Galárraga O; Marshall BD,Rhode Island medical journal (2013),2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24983016/,1,0,0,0,0,0
24933461,Ecophysiology of Anopheles gambiae s.l.: persistence in the Sahel.,"The dry-season biology of malaria vectors is poorly understood, especially in arid environments when no surface waters are available for several months, such as during the dry season in the Sahel. Here we reappraise results on the dry-season physiology of members of the Anopheles gambiae s.l. complex in the broad context of dormancy in insects and especially in mosquitoes. We examine evidence on seasonal changes in reproduction, metabolism, stress tolerance, nutrition, molecular regulation, and environmental conditions and determine if the current results are compatible with dry-season diapause (aestivation) as the primary strategy for persistence throughout the dry season in the Sahel. In the process, we point out critical gaps in our knowledge that future studies can fill. We find compelling evidence that members of the An. gambiae s.l. complex undergo a form of aestivation during the Sahelian dry season by shifting energetic resources away from reproduction and towards increased longevity. Considering the differences between winter at temperate latitudes, which entails immobility of the insect and hence reliance on physiological solutions, as opposed to the Sahelian dry season, which restricts reproduction exclusively, we propose that behavioral changes play an important role in complementing physiological changes in this strategy.",Huestis DL; Lehmann T,"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24933461/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Studies in animal models and from patients have suggested that allergic sensitization leads to food-specific IgE and T-helper lymphocyte type 2 cells, both of which seem to contribute to the pathogenesis along with basophils, mast cells, and antigen-presenting cells.

It has been documented that apoA-I, myeloperoxidase and paraoxonase 1 (PON1) form a complex in HDL that is critical for HDL binding and function. Myeloperoxidase has a negative impact on HDL function, whereas PON1 has a beneficial effect. Patients who lack apoA-I develop markedly premature CHD. Patients who lack ATP-binding cassette transfer protein A1 transporter function have only very small discoidal preβ-1 HDL, and develop hepatosplenomegaly, intermittent neuropathy and premature CHD, although significant heterogeneity for these disorders has been reported. Patients with LCAT deficiency have abnormal small discoidal LDLs and HDL particles, and develop kidney failure. Enzyme replacement therapy is being developed for the latter disorder. Recent data indicates that proteins other than apoA-I and apoA-II such as MPO and PON1 have important effects on HDL function.

24766887,CRISPR-Cas systems: Prokaryotes upgrade to adaptive immunity.,"Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), and associated proteins (Cas) comprise the CRISPR-Cas system, which confers adaptive immunity against exogenic elements in many bacteria and most archaea. CRISPR-mediated immunization occurs through the uptake of DNA from invasive genetic elements such as plasmids and viruses, followed by its integration into CRISPR loci. These loci are subsequently transcribed and processed into small interfering RNAs that guide nucleases for specific cleavage of complementary sequences. Conceptually, CRISPR-Cas shares functional features with the mammalian adaptive immune system, while also exhibiting characteristics of Lamarckian evolution. Because immune markers spliced from exogenous agents are integrated iteratively in CRISPR loci, they constitute a genetic record of vaccination events and reflect environmental conditions and changes over time. Cas endonucleases, which can be reprogrammed by small guide RNAs have shown unprecedented potential and flexibility for genome editing and can be repurposed for numerous DNA targeting applications including transcriptional control.",Barrangou R; Marraffini LA,Molecular cell,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24766887/,1,0,0,0,0,0
24744762,Antigen cross-presentation of immune complexes.,"The ability of dendritic cells (DCs) to cross-present tumor antigens has long been a focus of interest to physicians, as well as basic scientists, that aim to establish efficient cell-based cancer immune therapy. A prerequisite for exploiting this pathway for therapeutic purposes is a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the induction of tumor-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses when initiated by DCs via cross-presentation. The ability of humans DC to perform cross-presentation is of utmost interest, as this cell type is a main target for cell-based immunotherapy in humans. The outcome of a cross-presentation event is guided by the nature of the antigen, the form of antigen uptake, and the subpopulation of DCs that performs presentation. Generally, CD8α(+) DCs are considered to be the most potent cross-presenting DCs. This paradigm, however, only applies to soluble antigens. During adaptive immune responses, immune complexes form when antibodies interact with their specific epitopes on soluble antigens. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) immune complexes target Fc-gamma receptors on DCs to shuttle exogenous antigens efficiently into the cross-presentation pathway. This receptor-mediated cross-presentation pathway is a well-described route for the induction of strong CD8(+) T cell responses. IgG-mediated cross-presentation is intriguing because it permits the CD8(-) DCs, which are commonly considered to be weak cross-presenters, to efficiently cross-present. Engaging multiple DC subtypes for cross-presentation might be a superior strategy to boost CTL responses in vivo. We here summarize our current understanding of how DCs use IgG-complexed antigens for the efficient induction of CTL responses. Because of its importance for human cell therapy, we also review the recent advances in the characterization of cross-presentation properties of human DC subsets.",Platzer B; Stout M; Fiebiger E,Frontiers in immunology,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24744762/,1,0,0,0,0,0
24713999,Current breathomics--a review on data pre-processing techniques and machine learning in metabolomics breath analysis.,"We define breathomics as the metabolomics study of exhaled air. It is a strongly emerging metabolomics research field that mainly focuses on health-related volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Since the amount of these compounds varies with health status, breathomics holds great promise to deliver non-invasive diagnostic tools. Thus, the main aim of breathomics is to find patterns of VOCs related to abnormal (for instance inflammatory) metabolic processes occurring in the human body. Recently, analytical methods for measuring VOCs in exhaled air with high resolution and high throughput have been extensively developed. Yet, the application of machine learning methods for fingerprinting VOC profiles in the breathomics is still in its infancy. Therefore, in this paper, we describe the current state of the art in data pre-processing and multivariate analysis of breathomics data. We start with the detailed pre-processing pipelines for breathomics data obtained from gas-chromatography mass spectrometry and an ion-mobility spectrometer coupled to multi-capillary columns. The outcome of data pre-processing is a matrix containing the relative abundances of a set of VOCs for a group of patients under different conditions (e.g. disease stage, treatment). Independently of the utilized analytical method, the most important question, 'which VOCs are discriminatory?', remains the same. Answers can be given by several modern machine learning techniques (multivariate statistics) and, therefore, are the focus of this paper. We demonstrate the advantages as well the drawbacks of such techniques. We aim to help the community to understand how to profit from a particular method. In parallel, we hope to make the community aware of the existing data fusion methods, as yet unresearched in breathomics.",Smolinska A; Hauschild AC; Fijten RR; Dallinga JW; Baumbach J; van Schooten FJ,Journal of breath research,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24713999/,1,0,0,0,0,0
24681576,Methodological challenges in mendelian randomization.,"We give critical attention to the assumptions underlying Mendelian randomization analysis and their biological plausibility. Several scenarios violating the Mendelian randomization assumptions are described, including settings with inadequate phenotype definition, the setting of time-varying exposures, the presence of gene-environment interaction, the existence of measurement error, the possibility of reverse causation, and the presence of linkage disequilibrium. Data analysis examples are given, illustrating that the inappropriate use of instrumental variable techniques when the Mendelian randomization assumptions are violated can lead to biases of enormous magnitude. To help address some of the strong assumptions being made, three possible approaches are suggested. First, the original proposal of Katan (Lancet. 1986;1:507-508) for Mendelian randomization was not to use instrumental variable techniques to obtain estimates but merely to examine genotype-outcome associations to test for the presence of an effect of the exposure on the outcome. We show that this more modest goal and approach can circumvent many, though not all, the potential biases described. Second, we discuss the use of sensitivity analysis in evaluating the consequences of violations in the assumptions and in attempting to correct for those violations. Third, we suggest that a focus on negative, rather than positive, Mendelian randomization results may turn out to be more reliable.",VanderWeele TJ; Tchetgen Tchetgen EJ; Cornelis M; Kraft P,"Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24681576/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Pathological and biological evidence overwhelmingly demonstrate how the mammalian steroid cholesterol is present throughout the course of infection. Better understanding Mtb requires a more complete understanding of how it utilizes molecules like cholesterol in this environment to sustain the infection of the host. Cholesterol uptake, catabolism and broader utilization are important for maintenance of the pathogen in the host and it has been experimentally validated to contribute to virulence and pathogenesis. Cholesterol is catabolized by at least three distinct sub-pathways, two for the ring system and one for the side chain, yielding dozens of steroid intermediates with varying biochemical properties. Our ability to control this worldwide infectious agent requires a greater knowledge of how Mtb uses cholesterol to its advantage throughout the course of infection.

A small and poorly defined role for dysbiosis in the development of IBS symptoms has been established through characterization of altered intestinal microbiota in IBS patients and reported improvement of subjective symptoms after its manipulation with prebiotics, probiotics, or antibiotics. It remains to be determined whether IBS symptoms are caused by alterations in brain signaling from the intestine to the microbiota or primary disruption of the microbiota, and whether they are involved in altered interactions between the brain and intestine during development. We review the potential mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of IBS in different groups of patients.

24372255,Activation of B cells by a dendritic cell-targeted oral vaccine.,"Production of long-lived, high affinity humoral immunity is an essential characteristic of successful vaccination and requires cognate interactions between T and B cells in germinal centers. Within germinal centers, specialized T follicular helper cells assist B cells and regulate the antibody response by mediating the differentiation of B cells into memory or plasma cells after exposure to T cell-dependent antigens. It is now appreciated that local immune responses are also essential for protection against infectious diseases that gain entry to the host by the mucosal route; therefore, targeting the mucosal compartments is the optimum strategy to induce protective immunity. However, because the gastrointestinal mucosae are exposed to large amounts of environmental and dietary antigens on a daily basis, immune regulatory mechanisms exist to favor tolerance and discourage autoimmunity at these sites. Thus, mucosal vaccination strategies must ensure that the immunogen is efficiently taken up by the antigen presenting cells, and that the vaccine is capable of activating humoral and cellular immunity, while avoiding the induction of tolerance. Despite significant progress in mucosal vaccination, this potent platform for immunotherapy and disease prevention must be further explored and refined. Here we discuss recent progress in the understanding of the role of different phenotypes of B cells in the development of an efficacious mucosal vaccine against infectious disease.",Sahay B; Owen JL; Yang T; Zadeh M; Lightfoot YL; Ge JW; Mohamadzadeh M,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24372255/,1,0,0,0,0,0
24304979,"The multiple roles of guanylate cyclase C, a heat stable enterotoxin receptor.","Guanylate cyclase C (GC-C) is a transmembrane receptor that is expressed primarily on intestinal epithelial cells. Activation of this receptor by its endogenous peptide ligands initiates cyclic guanosine monophosphate-dependent (cGMP) salt and water movement in the intestine. GC-C is targeted by the enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli heat-stable enterotoxin STa, which deregulates this pathway and causes secretory diarrhea. This review discusses current work on the physiological function of GC-C in the intestine. Familial GC-C mutations demonstrate that epithelial cGMP signaling is critical to electrolyte and fluid balance in the neonatal intestine. Chronic deregulation of GC-C activity in early life increases susceptibility to a number of disorders, including obstruction and inflammatory bowel disease. Murine models indicate that GC-C regulates the composition of intestinal commensal microflora and that it suppresses bacterial infection and modulates colonic injury and inflammation. Therapeutic GC-C ligands are used to successfully treat constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and recent studies show that extracellular cGMP is an important mechanism of reducing abdominal pain associated with this disorder. Originally identified as a target of E. coli enterotoxin STa, GC-C is an important regulator of physiological salt and water homeostasis and may directly impact a wide range of intestinal disorders.",Steinbrecher KA,Current opinion in gastroenterology,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24304979/,1,0,0,0,0,0

24195062,Tsetse fly microbiota: form and function.,"Tsetse flies are the primary vectors of African trypanosomes, which cause Human and Animal African trypanosomiasis in 36 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. These flies have also established symbiotic associations with bacterial and viral microorganisms. Laboratory-reared tsetse flies harbor up to four vertically transmitted organisms-obligate Wigglesworthia, commensal Sodalis, parasitic Wolbachia and Salivary Gland Hypertrophy Virus (SGHV). Field-captured tsetse can harbor these symbionts as well as environmentally acquired commensal bacteria. This microbial community influences several aspects of tsetse's physiology, including nutrition, fecundity and vector competence. This review provides a detailed description of tsetse's microbiome, and describes the physiology underlying host-microbe, and microbe-microbe, interactions that occur in this fly.",Wang J; Weiss BL; Aksoy S,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24195062/,1,0,0,0,0,0
24170362,International perspectives on the impacts of reproductive technologies on food production in Asia.,"The greatest numbers of domestic animals are raised in Asia. The Asian animal industry is characterized by the involvement of a high percentage of the population, mostly smallholders, of which 95 % rear domestic animals. In exploring the best ways to formulate sustainable society, it is essential to make the most of livestock products by applying appropriate reproductive technologies. There is no doubt that reproductive technologies such as AI and ET have made a great contribution to increase the number of excellent animals. Although more advanced cutting edge reproductive technologies have become available and some of them have indeed a potential of revolutionary changes in livestock industry, the most important problem for increasing productivity concerns the maintenance of optimum nutrition and prevention of heat stress to support reproductive performance and increased supply of animal proteins. International societies should be involved in binding together developed and newly developing countries in the construction of a novel model for future livestock rearing management that suits diverse environmental circumstances.",Osawa T,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24170362/,1,0,0,0,0,0
24154642,Cognitive frailty: rational and definition from an (I.A.N.A./I.A.G.G.) international consensus group.,"The frailty syndrome has recently attracted attention of the scientific community and public health organizations as precursor and contributor of age-related conditions (particularly disability) in older persons. In parallel, dementia and cognitive disorders also represent major healthcare and social priorities. Although physical frailty and cognitive impairment have shown to be related in epidemiological studies, their pathophysiological mechanisms have been usually studied separately. An International Consensus Group on ""Cognitive Frailty"" was organized by the International Academy on Nutrition and Aging (I.A.N.A) and the International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics (I.A.G.G) on April 16th, 2013 in Toulouse (France). The present report describes the results of the Consensus Group and provides the first definition of a ""Cognitive Frailty"" condition in older adults. Specific aim of this approach was to facilitate the design of future personalized preventive interventions in older persons. Finally, the Group discussed the use of multidomain interventions focused on the physical, nutritional, cognitive and psychological domains for improving the well-being and quality of life in the elderly. The consensus panel proposed the identification of the so-called ""cognitive frailty"" as an heterogeneous clinical manifestation characterized by the simultaneous presence of both physical frailty and cognitive impairment. In particular, the key factors defining such a condition include: 1) presence of physical frailty and cognitive impairment (CDR=0.5); and 2) exclusion of concurrent AD dementia or other dementias. Under different circumstances, cognitive frailty may represent a precursor of neurodegenerative processes. A potential for reversibility may also characterize this entity. A psychological component of the condition is evident and concurs at increasing the vulnerability of the individual to stressors.",Kelaiditi E; Cesari M; Canevelli M; van Kan GA; Ousset PJ; Gillette-Guyonnet S; Ritz P; Duveau F; Soto ME; Provencher V; Nourhashemi F; Salvà A; Robert P; Andrieu S; Rolland Y; Touchon J; Fitten JL; Vellas B,"The journal of nutrition, health & aging",2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24154642/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Over the years, the rapidly emerging field of microfluidics has been pushing forward the healthcare industry with the development of microfluidic-based, point-of-care (POC) diagnostic devices. Though a great deal of work has been done in developing microfluidic platforms for disease diagnoses, potential microfluidic applications in the field of nutrition remain largely unexplored. In this Focus article, we would like to investigate the potential chances for microfluidics in the field of nutrition. We will first highlight some of the recent advances in microfluidic blood analysis systems that have the capacity to detect biomarkers of nutrition. Then we will examine existing examples of microfluidic devices for the detection of specific biomarkers of nutrition or nutrient content in food. Finally, we will discuss the challenges in this field and provide some insight into the future of applied microfluidics in nutrition.",Li S; Kiehne J; Sinoway LI; Cameron CE; Huang TJ,Lab on a chip,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24056522/,1,0,0,0,0,0
24051204,Microbiota impact on the epigenetic regulation of colorectal cancer.,"Mechanisms of colorectal cancer (CRC) development can be generally divided into three categories: genetic, epigenetic, and aberrant immunologic signaling pathways, all of which may be triggered by an imbalanced intestinal microbiota. Aberrant gut microbial composition, termed 'dysbiosis', has been reported in inflammatory bowel disease patients who are at increased risk for CRC development. Recent studies indicate that it is feasible to rescue experimental models of colonic cancer by oral treatment with genetically engineered beneficial bacteria and/or their immune-regulating gene products. Here, we review the mechanisms of epigenetic modulation implicated in the development and progression of CRC, which may be the result of dysbiosis, and therefore may be amenable to therapeutic intervention.",Yang T; Owen JL; Lightfoot YL; Kladde MP; Mohamadzadeh M,Trends in molecular medicine,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24051204/,1,0,0,0,0,0
23952093,EURRECA-Principles and future for deriving micronutrient recommendations.,"The EURopean micronutrient RECommendations Aligned (EURRECA) Network of Excellence (NoE) explored an approach for setting micronutrient recommendations, which would address the variation in recommendations across Europe. Therefore, a framework for deriving and using micronutrient Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) has been developed. This framework comprises four stages (defining the problem-monitoring and evaluating-deriving dietary reference values-using dietary reference values in policy making). The aim of the present paper is to use this framework to identify specific research gaps and needs related to (1) knowledge available on specific micronutrients (folate, iodine, iron, selenium, vitamin B12, vitamin D, and zinc) and (2) the methodology presented in the framework. Furthermore, the paper describes the different outputs that support the process like protocols, guidelines, systematic review databases, and peer-reviewed publications, as well as the principal routes of dissemination of these outputs to ensure their optimal uptake in policy, practice, and research collaborations. The importance of ensuring transparency in risk assessment and risk management, systematic searching the literature, and taking into account policy options is highlighted.

23929902,Regulatory T cells and the immune pathogenesis of prenatal infection.,"Pregnancy in placental mammals offers exceptional comprehensive benefits of in utero protection, nutrition, and metabolic waste elimination for the developing fetus. However, these benefits also require durable strategies to mitigate maternal rejection of fetal tissues expressing foreign paternal antigens. Since the initial postulate of expanded maternal immune tolerance by Sir Peter Medawar 60 years ago, an amazingly elaborate assortment of molecular and cellular modifications acting both locally at the maternal-placental interface and systemically have been shown to silence potentially detrimental maternal immune responses. In turn, simultaneously maintaining host defense against the infinite array of potential pathogens during pregnancy is equally important. Fortunately, resistance against most infections is preserved seamlessly throughout gestation. On the other hand, recent studies on pathogens with unique predisposition for prenatal infections have uncovered distinctive holes in host defense associated with the reproductive process. Using these infections to probe the response during pregnancy, the immune suppressive regulatory subset of maternal CD4 T cells has been increasingly shown to dictate the inter-workings between prenatal infection susceptibility and pathogenesis of ensuing pregnancy complications. Herein, the recent literature suggesting a necessity for maternal regulatory T cells (Tregs) in pregnancy-induced immunological shifts that sustain fetal tolerance is reviewed. Additional discussion is focused on how expansion of maternal Treg suppression may become exploited by pathogens that cause prenatal infections and the perilous potential of infection-induced immune activation that may mitigate fetal tolerance and inadvertently inject hostility into the protective in utero environment.",Rowe JH; Ertelt JM; Xin L; Way SS,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23929902/,1,0,0,0,0,0
23835515,New generation of oral mucosal vaccines targeting dendritic cells.,"As most infectious organisms gain entry at mucosal surfaces, there is a great deal of interest in developing vaccines that elicit effective mucosal immune responses against pathogen challenge. Targeted vaccination is one of the most effective methods available to prevent and control infectious diseases. Mucosal vaccines can offer lower costs, better accessibility, needle free delivery, and a higher capacity for mass immunizations during pandemics. Both local mucosal immunity and robust systemic responses can be achieved through mucosal vaccination. Recent progress in understanding the molecular and cellular components of the mucosal immune system have allowed for the development of a novel mucosal vaccine platform utilizing specific dendritic cell-targeting peptides and orally administered lactobacilli to elicit efficient antigen specific immune responses against infections, including Bacillus anthracis in experimental models of disease.",Owen JL; Sahay B; Mohamadzadeh M,Current opinion in chemical biology,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23835515/,1,0,0,0,0,0
23796635,Systematic review on daily vitamin B12 losses and bioavailability for deriving recommendations on vitamin B12 intake with the factorial approach.,"To systematically review the literature on daily losses and bioavailability of vitamin B12. These estimates could be used for deriving recommendations on vitamin B12 intake for adults and elderly. We identified publications on daily vitamin B12 losses (July 2011) and publications on the bioavailability of vitamin B12 from foods or diets (June 2010) in MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library. A pooled analysis of five studies (52 subjects) showed that 0.13 ± 0.03% of the total body store is lost per day. Absorption of vitamin B12 ranged from 4.5 (dose of 38 µg from consumption of liver) to 83% (dose of 3.0 µg from consumption of mutton meat). Data from eight studies including 83 subjects suggested that the amount of vitamin B12 absorbed from food (Ai) increased with increasing doses of vitamin B12 (Di) as described by the equation: ln(Ai) = 0.7694 * ln(Di) - 0.9614. Daily vitamin B12 losses in apparently healthy adults and elderly probably range from 1.4 to 5.1 µg. Vitamin B12 intakes needed to compensate for these losses seem to range from 3.8 to 20.7 µg. More evidence is needed on the relationships between biochemical markers of vitamin B12 status, vitamin B12 body store and long-term health outcomes to evaluate whether current recommendations on vitamin B12 intake (1.4-3 µg) need to be changed.",Doets EL; In 't Veld PH; Szczecińska A; Dhonukshe-Rutten RA; Cavelaars AE; van 't Veer P; Brzozowska A; de Groot LC,Annals of nutrition & metabolism,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23796635/,0,1,0,0,0,0
23746904,Food supply and food safety issues in China.,"Food supply and food safety are major global public health issues, and are particularly important in heavily populated countries such as China. Rapid industrialisation and modernisation in China are having profound effects on food supply and food safety. In this Review, we identified important factors limiting agricultural production in China, including conversion of agricultural land to other uses, freshwater deficits, and soil quality issues. Additionally, increased demand for some agricultural products is examined, particularly those needed to satisfy the increased consumption of animal products in the Chinese diet, which threatens to drive production towards crops used as animal feed. Major sources of food poisoning in China include pathogenic microorganisms, toxic animals and plants entering the food supply, and chemical contamination. Meanwhile, two growing food safety issues are illegal additives and contamination of the food supply by toxic industrial waste. China's connections to global agricultural markets are also having important effects on food supply and food safety within the country. Although the Chinese Government has shown determination to reform laws, establish monitoring systems, and strengthen food safety regulation, weak links in implementation remain.",Lam HM; Remais J; Fung MC; Xu L; Sun SS,"Lancet (London, England)",2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23746904/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We report here the findings from the previous studies suggesting impairment of growth and nutritional deficiencies because of elimination diets for food allergy. Feeding difficulties have also been reported, particularly in children with eosinophilic esophagitis that may further impact the nutrient intake. Food allergies are becoming more prevalent and better recognized. Treatment options typically include strict dietary elimination of major food allergens such as milk, eggs, wheat, soy, peanut, tree nuts, fish and shellfish.

23377701,Adrenal insufficiency in pregnancy: challenging issues in diagnosis and management.,"Adrenal insufficiency (AI) in pregnancy is relatively rare, but it is associated with significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality if untreated during gestation or in the puerperium. Hence, timely diagnosis and decisive treatment by the clinician are critical. However, due to pregnancy-induced metabolic and endocrine changes and the resemblance of symptomatology of AI to those of pregnancy, the diagnosis is often difficult to recognize and challenging to confirm. Normal pregnancy is a state of glucocorticoid excess particularly in the latter stages, and normative values for serum cortisol levels are not well-established. Furthermore, testing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis using validated stimulation tests during pregnancy are lacking. Therefore, it is the aim of the present review to discuss and to summarize the current knowledge, focussing on the challenges in recognizing AI in pregnancy and interpreting the diagnostic tests, and to propose a clinical approach for optimizing the management of AI in women diagnosed before or during pregnancy.",Yuen KC; Chong LE; Koch CA,Endocrine,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23377701/,1,0,0,0,0,0
23370154,Leptin-based adjuvants: an innovative approach to improve vaccine response.,"Leptin is a pleiotropic hormone with multiple direct and regulatory immune functions. Leptin deficiency or resistance hinders the immunologic, metabolic, and neuroendocrinologic processes necessary to thwart infections and their associated complications, and to possibly protect against infectious diseases following vaccination. Circulating leptin levels are proportional to body fat mass. High circulating leptin concentrations, as observed in obesity, are indicative of the development of leptin transport saturation/signaling desensitization. Leptin bridges nutritional status and immunity. Although its role in vaccine response is currently unknown, over-nutrition has been shown to suppress vaccine-induced immune responses. For instance, obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m(2)) is associated with lower antigen-specific antibody titers following influenza, hepatitis B, and tetanus vaccinations. This suggests that obesity, and possibly saturable leptin levels, are contributing factors to poor vaccine immunogenicity. While leptin-based therapies have not been investigated as vaccine adjuvants thus far, leptin's role in immunity suggests that application of these therapies is promising and worth investigation to enhance vaccine response in people with leptin signaling impairments. This review will examine the possibility of using leptin as a vaccine adjuvant by: briefly reviewing the distribution and signal transduction of leptin and its receptors; discussing the physiology of leptin with emphasis on its immune functions; reviewing the causes of attenuation of leptin signaling; and finally, providing plausible inferences for the innovative use of leptin-based pharmacotherapies as vaccine adjuvants.",White SJ; Taylor MJ; Hurt RT; Jensen MD; Poland GA,Vaccine,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23370154/,1,0,0,0,0,0
23297259,Transmission and epidemiology of zoonotic protozoal diseases of companion animals.,"Over 77 million dogs and 93 million cats share our households in the United States. Multiple studies have demonstrated the importance of pets in their owners' physical and mental health. Given the large number of companion animals in the United States and the proximity and bond of these animals with their owners, understanding and preventing the diseases that these companions bring with them are of paramount importance. Zoonotic protozoal parasites, including toxoplasmosis, Chagas' disease, babesiosis, giardiasis, and leishmaniasis, can cause insidious infections, with asymptomatic animals being capable of transmitting disease. Giardia and Toxoplasma gondii, endemic to the United States, have high prevalences in companion animals. Leishmania and Trypanosoma cruzi are found regionally within the United States. These diseases have lower prevalences but are significant sources of human disease globally and are expanding their companion animal distribution. Thankfully, healthy individuals in the United States are protected by intact immune systems and bolstered by good nutrition, sanitation, and hygiene. Immunocompromised individuals, including the growing number of obese and/or diabetic people, are at a much higher risk of developing zoonoses. Awareness of these often neglected diseases in all health communities is important for protecting pets and owners. To provide this awareness, this review is focused on zoonotic protozoal mechanisms of virulence, epidemiology, and the transmission of pathogens of consequence to pet owners in the United States.",Esch KJ; Petersen CA,Clinical microbiology reviews,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23297259/,1,0,0,0,0,0

23230082,"New insights into the determination of HDL structure by apolipoproteins: Thematic review series: high density lipoprotein structure, function, and metabolism.","Apolipoprotein (apo)A-I is the principal protein component of HDL, and because of its conformational adaptability, it can stabilize all HDL subclasses. The amphipathic α-helix is the structural motif that enables apoA-I to achieve this functionality. In the lipid-free state, the helical segments unfold and refold in seconds and are located in the N-terminal two thirds of the molecule where they are loosely packed as a dynamic, four-helix bundle. The C-terminal third of the protein forms an intrinsically disordered domain that mediates initial binding to phospholipid surfaces, which occurs with coupled α-helix formation. The lipid affinity of apoA-I confers detergent-like properties; it can solubilize vesicular phospholipids to create discoidal HDL particles with diameters of approximately 10 nm. Such particles contain a segment of phospholipid bilayer and are stabilized by two apoA-I molecules that are arranged in an anti-parallel, double-belt conformation around the edge of the disc, shielding the hydrophobic phospholipid acyl chains from exposure to water. The apoA-I molecules are in a highly dynamic state, and they stabilize discoidal particles of different sizes by certain segments forming loops that detach reversibly from the particle surface. The flexible apoA-I molecule adapts to the surface of spherical HDL particles by bending and forming a stabilizing trefoil scaffold structure. The above characteristics of apoA-I enable it to partner with ABCA1 in mediating efflux of cellular phospholipid and cholesterol and formation of a heterogeneous population of nascent HDL particles. Novel insights into the structure-function relationships of apoA-I should help reveal mechanisms by which HDL subclass distribution can be manipulated.",Phillips MC,Journal of lipid research,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23230082/,1,0,0,0,0,0
23229327,"The impoverished gut--a triple burden of diarrhoea, stunting and chronic disease.","More than one-fifth of the world's population live in extreme poverty, where a lack of safe water and adequate sanitation enables high rates of enteric infections and diarrhoea to continue unabated. Although oral rehydration therapy has greatly reduced diarrhoea-associated mortality, enteric infections still persist, disrupting intestinal absorptive and barrier functions and resulting in up to 43% of stunted growth, affecting one-fifth of children worldwide and one-third of children in developing countries. Diarrhoea in children from impoverished areas during their first 2 years might cause, on average, an 8 cm growth shortfall and 10 IQ point decrement by the time they are 7-9 years old. A child's height at their second birthday is therefore the best predictor of cognitive development or 'human capital'. To this 'double burden' of diarrhoea and malnutrition, data now suggest that children with stunted growth and repeated gut infections are also at increased risk of developing obesity and its associated comorbidities, resulting in a 'triple burden' of the impoverished gut.

23137966,Targeting aberrant colon cancer-specific DNA methylation with lipoteichoic acid-deficient Lactobacillus acidophilus.,"Pathogenic autoinflammatory responses triggered by dysregulated microbial interactions may lead to intestinal disorders and malignancies. Previously, we demonstrated that a lipoteichoic acid (LTA)-deficient Lactobacillus acidophilus strain, NCK2025, ameliorated inflammation-induced colitis, significantly reduced the number of polyps in a colonic polyposis cancer model and restored physiological homeostasis in both cases. Nonetheless, the regulatory signals delivered by NCK2025 to reprogram the gastrointestinal microenvironment, and thus resist colonic cancer progression, remain unknown. Accumulating evidence suggest that epigenetic changes, in the presence and absence of pathogenic inflammation, can result in colorectal cancer (CRC). To test possible epigenetic modifications induced by NCK2025, the expression of epigenetically regulated, CRC-associated genes was measured with and without bacterial treatment. In vivo and in vitro, NCK2025 enhanced the expression of tumor suppressor genes that may regulate CRC development. Therefore, differential epigenetic regulation of CRC-related genes by NCK2025 represents a potential therapy against colitis-associated and sporadic CRC.",Lightfoot YL; Yang T; Sahay B; Mohamadzadeh M,Gut microbes,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23137966/,1,0,0,0,0,0
23053396,Immunopathogenesis of non-healing American cutaneous leishmaniasis and progressive visceral leishmaniasis.,"The outcomes of Leishmania infection are determined by host immune and nutrition status, parasite species, and co-infection with other pathogens. While subclinical infection and self-healing cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) are common, uncontrolled parasite replication can lead to non-healing local lesions or visceral leishmaniasis (VL). It is known that infection control requires Th1-differentiation cytokines (IL-12, IL-18, and IL-27) and Th1 cell and macrophage activation. However, there is no generalized consensus for the mechanisms of host susceptibility. The recent studies on regulatory T cells and IL-17-producing cells help explain the effector T cell responses that occur independently of the known Th1/Th2 cell signaling pathways. This review focuses on the immunopathogenesis of non-healing American CL and progressive VL. We summarize recent evidence from human and animal studies that reveals the mechanisms of dysregulated, hyper-responses to Leishmania braziliensis, as well as the presence of disease-promoting or the absence of protective responses to Leishmania amazonensis and Leishmania donovani. We highlight immune-mediated parasite growth and immunopathogenesis, with an emphasis on the putative roles of IL-17 and its related cytokines as well as arginase. A better understanding of the quality and regulation of innate immunity and T cell responses triggered by Leishmania will aid in the rational control of pathology and the infection.",Soong L; Henard CA; Melby PC,Seminars in immunopathology,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23053396/,1,0,0,0,0,0
23030422,Bacteriophage endolysins as novel antimicrobials.,"Endolysins are enzymes used by bacteriophages at the end of their replication cycle to degrade the peptidoglycan of the bacterial host from within, resulting in cell lysis and release of progeny virions. Due to the absence of an outer membrane in the Gram-positive bacterial cell wall, endolysins can access the peptidoglycan and destroy these organisms when applied externally, making them interesting antimicrobial candidates, particularly in light of increasing bacterial drug resistance. This article reviews the modular structure of these enzymes, in which cell wall binding and catalytic functions are separated, as well as their mechanism of action, lytic activity and potential as antimicrobials. It particularly focuses on molecular engineering as a means of optimizing endolysins for specific applications, highlights new developments that may render these proteins active against Gram-negative and intracellular pathogens and summarizes the most recent applications of endolysins in the fields of medicine, food safety, agriculture and biotechnology.",Schmelcher M; Donovan DM; Loessner MJ,Future microbiology,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23030422/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22933751,Responsibilities to plan for ancillary care pose ethical challenges for nutrition research in the community setting.,"Investigators who conduct nutrition research in the community setting, particularly among underserved populations, face the ethical question of whether and how to respond to participants' unmet health needs. The research ethics literature conceptualizes this question as one of ancillary care (AC): what is the nature and extent of researchers' ethical responsibilities, if any, to provide or facilitate health care that research participants need but that is not necessary to ensure the safety or scientific validity of the research? In this paper, we highlight 3 ethical challenges involved in the planning of AC responses for nutrition research conducted in the community setting: influence of provision of AC on primary study outcomes as an issue of trial design; whether to extend the provision of AC beyond research participants to nonparticipants with the same health needs; and how best to train field workers who may be the most likely members of the study team to encounter the health needs anticipated among participants. Although the global ethical discussion of AC is gaining in depth, breadth, and practical influence, it remains relatively uninformed by perspectives specific to nutrition research. Our objective is to encourage nutrition researchers to engage proactively in the emerging ethical discussion of AC, so that their relevant experiences and concerns can be taken into account in the eventual formation of ethical guidelines and policies.",Merritt MW; Taylor HA,The Journal of nutrition,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22933751/,1,0,0,0,0,0

As such, the immune network of the intestine relies on both dietary and commensal derived signals to guide appropriate function. Recent advances highlight the role of dietary derived nutrients and commensal derived metabolites in shaping gastrointestinal immunity.

22777545,"Early life precursors, epigenetics, and the development of food allergy.","Food allergy (FA), a major clinical and public health concern worldwide, is caused by a complex interplay of environmental exposures, genetic variants, gene-environment interactions, and epigenetic alterations. This review summarizes recent advances surrounding these key factors, with a particular focus on the potential role of epigenetics in the development of FA. Epidemiologic studies have reported a number of nongenetic factors that may influence the risk of FA, such as timing of food introduction and feeding pattern, diet/nutrition, exposure to environmental tobacco smoking, prematurity and low birth weight, microbial exposure, and race/ethnicity. Current studies on the genetics of FA are mainly conducted using candidate gene approaches, which have linked more than 10 genes to the genetic susceptibility of FA. Studies on gene-environment interactions of FA are very limited. Epigenetic alteration has been proposed as one of the mechanisms to mediate the influence of early life environmental exposures and gene-environment interactions on the development of diseases later in life. The role of epigenetics in the regulation of the immune system and the epigenetic effects of some FA-associated environmental exposures are discussed in this review. There is a particular lack of large-scale prospective birth cohort studies that simultaneously assess the interrelationships of early life exposures, genetic susceptibility, epigenomic alterations, and the development of FA. The identification of these key factors and their independent and joint contributions to FA will allow us to gain important insight into the biological mechanisms by which environmental exposures and genetic susceptibility affect the risk of FA and will provide essential information to develop more effective new paradigms in the diagnosis, prevention, and management of FA.",Hong X; Wang X,Seminars in immunopathology,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22777545/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22683415,Understanding vaginal microbiome complexity from an ecological perspective.,"The various microbiota normally associated with the human body have an important influence on human development, physiology, immunity, and nutrition. This is certainly true for the vagina wherein communities of mutualistic bacteria constitute the first line of defense for the host by excluding invasive, nonindigenous organisms that may cause disease. In recent years much has been learned about the bacterial species composition of these communities and how they differ between individuals of different ages and ethnicities. A deeper understanding of their origins and the interrelationships of constituent species is needed to understand how and why they change over time or in response to changes in the host environment. Moreover, there are few unifying theories to explain the ecological dynamics of vaginal ecosystems as they respond to disturbances caused by menses and human activities such as intercourse, douching, and other habits and practices.

22669752,Integrative medicine in allergy and immunology.,"Integrative medicine is a relatively new discipline which attempts to combine allopathic medicine with alternative or complementary medicine, to reap the benefits of both forms of medicine in optimizing the care of patients. Integrative medicine concentrates on treating the patient as a whole, both in body and mind. While the scientific method and ""evidence-based"" clinical research drives the management and treatment of diseases in conventional Western medicine, alternative or complementary medicine is based on unproven yet potentially beneficial techniques that have been developed throughout history, dating back to the ancient cultures in the Middle East, Africa, and China. In spite of the lack of evidence of most alternative medicine techniques, these methodologies have been practiced for centuries with great acceptance in many countries. It is in the Western world, where ""modern"" medicine is dictated by the scientific method, that the most controversy in the use of these alternative modes of therapy exists. Since the science behind alternative medicine is incomplete or non-existent, it is difficult for those trained in Western medicine to accept or adopt this approach. But perhaps it is the failure of Western medicine to adequately guarantee our well being and good health that have led to the ongoing debate between the medical profession and the general public as to the benefits of these alternative treatments. In one sense, integrative medicine may be a futile attempt to coin a new term in the hope of legitimizing alternative medicine. On the other hand, there is a wealth of historical experience in the use of the techniques. Studies to evaluate the scientific basis behind ancient medical techniques are ongoing, and it is to be expected that the results will neither be uniformly positive nor negative. Of particular interest is the effect of traditional medicine, herbal formulations, and manipulative techniques on the immune system, and its application in the treatment of autoimmune and allergic diseases. Studies are being designed or conducted to investigate immune effects of herbal formulations or their components. Herbal plants or medicines may lead to skewing of the Th1/Th2 balance in either direction, thus may offer potential application in the treatment of allergic or autoimmune diseases.",Chang C; Gershwin ME,Clinical reviews in allergy & immunology,2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22669752/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22573192,Food and the gut microbiota in inflammatory bowel diseases: a critical connection.,"The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract apparently due to an abnormal immune response to environmental factors in genetically susceptible hosts. The composition of the gut microbiota is thought to be a critical environmental factor in IBD, and recent evidence suggests a connection between diet and the intestinal bacteria. In this review, we describe the current evidence regarding the impact of diet on the gut microbiome and how this may be relevant to the pathogenesis of IBD. Novel culture-independent DNA sequencing technology has revolutionized the approach to the characterization of intestinal bacterial communities. Recent studies have demonstrated an association between the diet and the human microbiome. Because the development of a 'dysbiotic' microbiota is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of IBD, diet is being investigated as an important etiologic factor. The recent studies highlighting the impact of diet on the gut microbiome provide a strong rationale for further investigation of the link between diet, the gut microbiome, and the development of IBD. Such studies may provide novel information about disease pathogenesis as well as identify new therapeutic alternatives for patients suffering from IBD.",Albenberg LG; Lewis JD; Wu GD,Current opinion in gastroenterology,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22573192/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22540256,Nutritional metabolomics: progress in addressing complexity in diet and health.,"Nutritional metabolomics is rapidly maturing to use small-molecule chemical profiling to support integration of diet and nutrition in complex biosystems research. These developments are critical to facilitate transition of nutritional sciences from population-based to individual-based criteria for nutritional research, assessment, and management. This review addresses progress in making these approaches manageable for nutrition research. Important concept developments concerning the exposome, predictive health, and complex pathobiology serve to emphasize the central role of diet and nutrition in integrated biosystems models of health and disease. Improved analytic tools and databases for targeted and nontargeted metabolic profiling, along with bioinformatics, pathway mapping, and computational modeling, are now used for nutrition research on diet, metabolism, microbiome, and health associations. These new developments enable metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) and provide a foundation for nutritional metabolomics, along with genomics, epigenomics, and health phenotyping, to support the integrated models required for personalized diet and nutrition forecasting.",Jones DP; Park Y; Ziegler TR,Annual review of nutrition,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22540256/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22488425,Hepatic ABC transporters and triglyceride metabolism.,"Elevated plasma triglyceride and reduced HDL concentrations are prominent features of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Individuals with Tangier disease also have elevated plasma triglyceride concentrations and very low HDL, resulting from mutations in ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), an integral membrane protein that facilitates nascent HDL particle assembly. Past studies attributed the inverse relationship between plasma HDL and triglyceride to intravascular lipid exchange and catabolic events. However, recent studies also suggest that hepatic signaling and lipid mobilization and secretion may explain how HDL affects plasma triglyceride concentrations. Hepatocyte-specific ABCA1 knockout mice have markedly reduced plasma HDL and a two-fold increase in triglyceride due to failure to assemble nascent HDL particles by hepatocytes, causing increased catabolism of HDL apolipoprotein A-I and increased hepatic production of triglyceride-enriched VLDL. In-vitro studies suggest that nascent HDL particles may induce signaling to decrease triglyceride secretion. Inhibition of microRNA 33 expression in nonhuman primates augments hepatic ABCA1, genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, and decreases expression of lipogenic genes, causing increased plasma HDL and decreased triglyceride levels. New evidence suggests potential mechanisms by which hepatic ABCA1-mediated nascent HDL formation regulates VLDL-triglyceride production and contributes to the inverse relationship between plasma HDL and triglyceride.",Parks JS; Chung S; Shelness GS,Current opinion in lipidology,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22488425/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22457397,The effects of fructose intake on serum uric acid vary among controlled dietary trials.,"Hyperuricemia is linked to gout and features of metabolic syndrome. There is concern that dietary fructose may increase uric acid concentrations. To assess the effects of fructose on serum uric acid concentrations in people with and without diabetes, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled feeding trials. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for relevant trials (through August 19, 2011). Analyses included all controlled feeding trials ≥ 7 d investigating the effect of fructose feeding on uric acid under isocaloric conditions, where fructose was isocalorically exchanged with other carbohydrate, or hypercaloric conditions, and where a control diet was supplemented with excess energy from fructose. Data were aggregated by the generic inverse variance method using random effects models and expressed as mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. Heterogeneity was assessed by the Q statistic and quantified by I(2). A total of 21 trials in 425 participants met the eligibility criteria. Isocaloric exchange of fructose for other carbohydrate did not affect serum uric acid in diabetic and nondiabetic participants [MD = 0.56 μmol/L (95% CI: -6.62, 7.74)], with no evidence of inter-study heterogeneity. Hypercaloric supplementation of control diets with fructose (+35% excess energy) at extreme doses (213-219 g/d) significantly increased serum uric acid compared with the control diets alone in nondiabetic participants [MD = 31.0 mmol/L (95% CI: 15.4, 46.5)] with no evidence of heterogeneity. Confounding from excess energy cannot be ruled out in the hypercaloric trials. These analyses do not support a uric acid-increasing effect of isocaloric fructose intake in nondiabetic and diabetic participants. Hypercaloric fructose intake may, however, increase uric acid concentrations. The effect of the interaction of energy and fructose remains unclear. Larger, well-designed trials of fructose feeding at ""real world"" doses are needed.",Wang DD; Sievenpiper JL; de Souza RJ; Chiavaroli L; Ha V; Cozma AI; Mirrahimi A; Yu ME; Carleton AJ; Di Buono M; Jenkins AL; Leiter LA; Wolever TM; Beyene J; Kendall CW; Jenkins DJ,The Journal of nutrition,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22457397/,0,1,0,1,0,0
22414338,The impact of obesity on the immune response to infection.,"There is strong evidence indicating that excess adiposity negatively impacts immune function and host defence in obese individuals. This is a review of research findings concerning the impact of obesity on the immune response to infection, including a discussion of possible mechanisms. Obesity is characterised by a state of low-grade, chronic inflammation in addition to disturbed levels of circulating nutrients and metabolic hormones. The impact of these metabolic abnormalities on obesity-related comorbidities has undergone intense scrutiny over the past decade. However, relatively little is known of how the immune system and host defence are influenced by the pro-inflammatory and excess energy milieu of the obese. Epidemiological data suggest obese human subjects are at greater risk for nosocomial infections, especially following surgery. Additionally, the significance of altered immunity in obese human subjects is emphasised by recent studies reporting obesity to be an independent risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality following infection with the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. Rodent models offer important insight into how metabolic abnormalities associated with excess body weight can impair immunity. However, more research is necessary to understand the specific aspects of immunity that are impaired and what factors are contributing to reduced immunocompetence in the obese. Additionally, special consideration of how infection in this at-risk population is managed is required, given that this population may not respond optimally to antimicrobial drugs and vaccination. Obesity impacts millions globally, and greater understanding of its associated physiological disturbances is a key public health concern.",Milner JJ; Beck MA,The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22414338/,1,0,0,0,0,0

22332091,Recent advances in understanding the role of nutrition in human genome evolution.,"Dietary transitions in human history have been suggested to play important roles in the evolution of mankind. Genetic variations caused by adaptation to diet during human evolution could have important health consequences in current society. The advance of sequencing technologies and the rapid accumulation of genome information provide an unprecedented opportunity to comprehensively characterize genetic variations in human populations and unravel the genetic basis of human evolution. Series of selection detection methods, based on various theoretical models and exploiting different aspects of selection signatures, have been developed. Their applications at the species and population levels have respectively led to the identification of human specific selection events that distinguish human from nonhuman primates and local adaptation events that contribute to human diversity. Scrutiny of candidate genes has revealed paradigms of adaptations to specific nutritional components and genome-wide selection scans have verified the prevalence of diet-related selection events and provided many more candidates awaiting further investigation. Understanding the role of diet in human evolution is fundamental for the development of evidence-based, genome-informed nutritional practices in the era of personal genomics.",Ye K; Gu Z,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22332091/,1,0,0,0,0,0

This year's summary will focus on recent advances in pediatric asthma that show significant accomplishments in reducing asthma morbidity and mortality over the last 10 years and discuss some pathways to further reduce asthma burden, as indicated in Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology publications in 2011. Some of the recent reports continue to shed light on methods to improve asthma management through steps to reduce asthma exacerbations, identify features of the disease in early childhood, alter asthma progression, intervene with nutrition, and more effectively implement the asthma guidelines. As new information evolves, it is also time to consider a revision of the asthma guidelines based on key studies that affect our management of the disease since the last revision in 2007. Now is also the time to use information recorded in electronic medical records to develop innovative disease management plans that will track asthma over time and enable timely decisions on interventions to maintain control that can lead to disease remission and prevention.",Szefler SJ,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22196525/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22178192,"Site-specific oxidation of apolipoprotein A-I impairs cholesterol export by ABCA1, a key cardioprotective function of HDL.","The mechanisms that deprive HDL of its cardioprotective properties are poorly understood. One potential pathway involves oxidative damage of HDL proteins by myeloperoxidase (MPO) a heme enzyme secreted by human artery wall macrophages. Mass spectrometric analysis demonstrated that levels of 3-chlorotyrosine and 3-nitrotyrosine - two characteristic products of MPO - are elevated in HDL isolated from patients with established cardiovascular disease. When apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the major HDL protein, is oxidized by MPO, its ability to promote cellular cholesterol efflux by the membrane-associated ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) pathway is diminished. Biochemical studies revealed that oxidation of specific tyrosine and methionine residues in apoA-I contributes to this loss of ABCA1 activity. Another potential mechanism for generating dysfunctional HDL involves covalent modification of apoA-I by reactive carbonyls, which have been implicated in atherogenesis and diabetic vascular disease. Indeed, modification of apoA-I by malondialdehyde (MDA) or acrolein also markedly impaired the lipoprotein's ability to promote cellular cholesterol efflux by the ABCA1 pathway. Tandem mass spectrometric analyses revealed that these reactive carbonyls target specific Lys residues in the C-terminus of apoA-I. Importantly, immunochemical analyses showed that levels of MDA-protein adducts are elevated in HDL isolated from human atherosclerotic lesions. Also, apoA-I co-localized with acrolein adducts in such lesions. Thus, lipid peroxidation products might specifically modify HDL in vivo. Our observations support the hypotheses that MPO and reactive carbonyls might generate dysfunctional HDL in humans.

22089447,Food insecurity: special considerations for women.,"Food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. Food insecurity is the converse state, is often associated with poverty and low income, and has important implications for the health and nutrition of individuals. Given their contribution to food production and preparation, their role in society as child bearers and caregivers, the increasing number of female-headed households worldwide, and their disproportionately poor economic status, women need special consideration in discussions of food insecurity and its effect on health, nutrition, and behavior. This article reviews the scientific literature on issues related to women and food insecurity. Food insecurity is associated with obesity, anxiety, and depressive symptoms; risky sexual behavior; poor coping strategies; and negative pregnancy outcomes in women, although evidence about the direction and causality of associations is unclear. There is a lack of evidence and understanding of the effects of food insecurity in resource-poor settings, including its effect on weight, nutritional outcomes, and pregnancy outcomes, as well as its effect on progression of diseases such as HIV infection. More research is needed to guide efficient interventions that address food insecurity among women. However, practical experience suggests that both short-term assistance and longer-term strategies that improve livelihoods, address behavioral and coping strategies, acknowledge the mental health components of food insecurity, and attempt to ensure that women have the same economic opportunities, access to land, and economic power as men are important.",Ivers LC; Cullen KA,The American journal of clinical nutrition,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22089447/,1,0,0,0,0,0
22089439,Nutrition and disease progression pre-highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and post-HAART: can good nutrition delay time to HAART and affect response to HAART?,"Several studies have investigated a variety of nutritional supplementation interventions in adults with HIV. In this narrative review, we summarize the evidence from 31 clinical trials that explore clinical benefits of macronutrient and micronutrient supplementation in this population while attempting to answer the question of whether good nutrition can delay the time to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) initiation and response. We focused on trials published in English between 1990 and 2010 that reported on CD4 count, viral load, and disease progression or survival. Among 9 macronutrient and 22 micronutrient trials, we found that evidence for improved CD4 count and HIV viral load with nutritional supplementation was limited; only 11.1% and 36.8% of macronutrient and micronutrient supplementation trials, respectively, reported improved CD4 count; and 33.3% and 12.5% of macronutrient and micronutrient trials, respectively, reported decreased viral load. Given their utility as surrogate markers of HIV disease progression, this suggests limited evidence for nutritional interventions having an impact on delaying HAART initiation or on improving HAART response. However, there are challenges in evaluating the effects of nutritional supplementation on clinical disease in that comparisons are difficult due to heterogeneity in study design, patient population, nutrient doses and combinations, baseline levels of deficiency, and study endpoints, including lack of clarity in defining and reporting HAART status. Future studies need to adopt a more rigorous standard design with adequate power and follow-up and require a consensus on composition and dose of nutrient interventions to be tested to more specifically answer the question on the impact of nutritional interventions on HIV disease progression and HAART response.",Chandrasekhar A; Gupta A,The American journal of clinical nutrition,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22089439/,1,0,0,0,0,1
22003230,Physiology and Endocrinology Symposium: Harnessing basic knowledge of factors controlling puberty to improve synchronization of estrus and fertility in heifers.,"The development of replacement heifers is a major economic investment for all beef and dairy operations. The costs associated with heifer development cannot be recovered if heifers do not conceive and remain productive in the herd; therefore, heifers need to conceive early in the breeding season or risk being culled. Previous research has reported up to a 21% increase in fertility from pubertal estrus to the third estrus of a heifer. The use of reproductive tract scores to determine pubertal status has demonstrated that peripubertal and pubertal heifers have increased pregnancy success to estrous synchronization compared with heifers that were prepubertal. The development of RIA has allowed accurate measurement of peripheral blood hormone concentrations associated with the pubertal process and luteal formation. This basic knowledge has increased our understanding of the mechanisms that control puberty in heifers. In addition, understanding the hormonal changes that occur during the estrous cycle has allowed for the development of estrous synchronization protocols that result in increased control of follicular growth, regression of luteal tissue, and ovulation. Transrectal ultrasonography has increased our understanding of follicular waves; this understanding led to research investigating the endocrine regulation of follicular waves and development of methods to synchronize follicular waves for purposes of fixed-time AI. Current topics of research include the effect of antral follicle count on fertility and the effect of maternal nutrition (on the fetus in utero) on subsequent reproductive potential of a heifer (i.e., fetal programming). Advancements in genomic technologies will likely provide a powerful tool for selecting heifers at birth that will have a greater probability of being reproductively successful if managed correctly. Therefore, knowledge gained through basic research on factors that control puberty has improved and will continue to improve heifer development and fertility.",Perry GA,Journal of animal science,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22003230/,1,0,0,0,0,0
21986999,Literature review and global consensus on management of acute radiation syndrome affecting nonhematopoietic organ systems.,"The World Health Organization convened a panel of experts to rank the evidence for medical countermeasures for management of acute radiation syndrome (ARS) in a hypothetical scenario involving the hospitalization of 100 to 200 victims. The goal of this panel was to achieve consensus on optimal management of ARS affecting nonhematopoietic organ systems based upon evidence in the published literature. English-language articles were identified in MEDLINE and PubMed. Reference lists of retrieved articles were distributed to conferees in advance of and updated during the meeting. Published case series and case reports of ARS, publications of randomized controlled trials of relevant interventions used to treat nonirradiated individuals, reports of studies in irradiated animals, and prior recommendations of subject matter experts were selected. Studies were extracted using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation system. In cases in which data were limited or incomplete, a narrative review of the observations was made. No randomized controlled trials of medical countermeasures have been completed for individuals with ARS. Reports of countermeasures were often incompletely described, making it necessary to rely on data generated in nonirradiated humans and in experimental animals. A strong recommendation is made for the administration of a serotonin-receptor antagonist prophylactically when the suspected exposure is >2 Gy and topical steroids, antibiotics, and antihistamines for radiation burns, ulcers, or blisters; excision and grafting of radiation ulcers or necrosis with intractable pain; provision of supportive care to individuals with neurovascular syndrome; and administration of electrolyte replacement therapy and sedatives to individuals with significant burns, hypovolemia, and/or shock. A strong recommendation is made against the use of systemic steroids in the absence of a specific indication. A weak recommendation is made for the use of fluoroquinolones, bowel decontamination, loperamide, and enteral nutrition, and for selective oropharyngeal/digestive decontamination, blood glucose maintenance, and stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill patients.

21857247,Nutritional strategy for adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery: report of a working group of the Nutrition Committee of NASPGHAN/NACHRI.,"Surgical options for the treatment of adolescent obesity have been gaining popularity. Adolescent patients present a particular challenge to clinicians, secondary to age-related issues, revolving around both mental and physical growth. These age-related issues require a unique approach to nutritional intervention for adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery as opposed to standardized approaches for adults. Despite the increasing numbers of adolescents undergoing obesity surgery, evidence-based nutritional guidelines have yet to be published. The goal of this document is to provide the clinician with recommendations on how to assess, educate, nourish, and monitor the adolescent who has undergone obesity surgery. A multidisciplinary panel composed of 3 pediatric gastroenterologists, 1 psychologist, and 3 registered dietitians from the Nutrition Committee for the North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition and National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions, with experience in nutrition and adolescent weight loss surgery, reviewed the medical literature for evidence-based practice for nutritional strategies for patients undergoing bariatric surgery. In addition to this group, an adolescent medicine physician was consulted for matters related to reproductive health. The present article presents a consensus of recommendations based on a review of the literature. In areas for which there was a lack of evidence to support the recommendations, best-practice guidelines were used. The present article provides the clinician with an overview of the nutritional concerns for adolescent patients undergoing obesity surgery. These guidelines address the preoperative educational pathway, the postoperative diet progression, recognition of disordered eating, guidelines for female reproductive issues, and assistance for the adolescent in a school/college environment.",Fullmer MA; Abrams SH; Hrovat K; Mooney L; Scheimann AO; Hillman JB; Suskind DL,Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21857247/,0,0,0,0,0,0
21390053,State of the union between metabolism and the immune system in type 2 diabetes.,"Lymphocytes and myeloid cells (monocyte/macrophages) have important roles in multiple types of diseases characterized by unresolved inflammation. The relatively recent appreciation of obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D) as chronic inflammatory diseases has stimulated interest in understanding the role of immune cells in metabolic imbalance. Myeloid cells regulate inflammation through cytokine production and the adipose tissue remodeling that accompanies hyper-nutrition, thus are critical players in metabolic homeostasis. More recently, multiple studies have indicated a role for T cells in obesity-associated inflammation and insulin resistance in model organisms, with parallel work indicating that pro-inflammatory changes in T cells also associate with human T2D. Furthermore, the expansion of T cells with similar antigen-binding sites in obesity and T2D indicates these diseases share characteristics previously attributed to inflammatory autoimmune disorders. Parallel pro-inflammatory changes in the B-cell compartment of T2D patients have also been identified. Taken together, these studies indicate that in addition to accepted pro-inflammatory roles of myeloid cells in T2D, pro-inflammatory skewing of both major lymphocyte subsets has an important role in T2D disease pathogenesis. Basic immunological principles suggest that alterations in lymphocyte function in obesity and T2D patients are an integral part of a feed-forward pro-inflammatory loop involving additional cell types. Importantly, the pro-inflammatory loop almost inevitably includes adipocytes, known to respond to pro-inflammatory, pro-diabetogenic cytokines originating from the myeloid and lymphoid compartments. We propose a model for inflammation in T2D that functionally links lymphocyte, myeloid and adipocyte contributions, and importantly proposes that tools for B-cell ablation or regulation of T-cell subset balance may have a place in the endocrinologist's limited arsenal.",Nikolajczyk BS; Jagannathan-Bogdan M; Shin H; Gyurko R,Genes and immunity,2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21390053/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Lack of detectable plasma apolipoprotein (apo) A-I can be due to DNA deletions, rearrangements, or nonsense or frameshift mutations within the APOA1 gene resulting in a lack of apoA-I secretion. Such patients have marked HDL deficiency, normal levels of triglycerides and LDL cholesterol, and can have xanthomas and premature CHD. ApoA-I variants with amino acid substitutions, especially in the region of amino acid residues 50-93 and 170-178, have been associated with amyloidosis. Patients with homozygous Tangier disease have defective cellular cholesterol efflux due to mutations in the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter A1, detectable plasma apoA-I levels and prebeta-1 HDL in their plasma. They have decreased LDL cholesterol levels and can develop neuropathy and premature CHD. Patients with lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency have both prebeta-1 and alpha-4 HDL present in their plasma and develop corneal opacities, anemia, proteinuria, and kidney failure.

20608779,Secretion stress and antifungal resistance: an Achilles' heel of Aspergillus fumigatus?,"The ability of Aspergillus fumigatus to establish and maintain an infection requires a continuous supply of nutrients to fuel energy production and growth. Like other filamentous fungi, A. fumigatus acquires nutrients by absorption, a mode of nutrition that depends upon the secretion of extracellular hydrolases to degrade the complex organic polymers in host tissues into reduced forms of carbon and nitrogen. If the folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is exceeded during periods of high secretory activity, a signaling pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated to relieve the stress on the ER. Current evidence indicates that A. fumigatus relies upon this pathway to sustain the high rate of protease secretion needed to grow optimally in mammalian tissue. In addition, the UPR strengthens the ability of the secretory system to deliver cell wall and membrane components to the hyphal apex, which promotes the invasive growth of the expanding hyphae and protects the fungus from damage caused by antifungal drugs. The important contribution of UPR-dependent functions to the pathogenesis of invasive aspergillosis and antifungal susceptibility suggests that components of this pathway could be promising new targets for antifungal therapy.",Richie DL; Feng X; Krishnan K; Askew DS,Medical mycology,2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20608779/,1,0,0,0,0,0
20585247,Obesity genes and insulin resistance.,"The exploding prevalence of insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes (T2D) linked to obesity has become an alarming public health concern. Worldwide, approximately 171 million people suffer from obesity-induced diabetes and public health authorities expect this situation to deteriorate rapidly. An interesting clinical population of 'metabolically healthy but obese' (MHO) cases is relatively protected from T2D and its associated cardiovascular risk. The molecular basis for this protection is not well understood but is likely to involve reduced inflammatory responses. The inflammatory cells and pathways that respond to overnutrition are the primary subject matter for this review. The chance discovery of a genetic mutation in the Brd2 gene, which is located in the class II major histocompatibility complex and makes mice enormously fat but protects them from diabetes, offers revolutionary new insights into the cellular mechanisms that link obesity to insulin resistance and T2D. These Brd2-hypomorphic mice have reduced inflammation in fat that is normally associated with insulin resistance, and resemble MHO patients, suggesting novel therapeutic pathways for obese patients at risk for T2D. Deeper understanding of the functional links between genes that control inflammatory responses to diet-induced obesity is crucial to the development of therapies for obese, insulin-resistant patients.",Belkina AC; Denis GV,"Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity",2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20585247/,1,0,0,0,0,0

20480549,High-density lipoprotein heterogeneity and function in reverse cholesterol transport.,"HDL is a cardioprotective lipoprotein, at least in part, because of its ability to mediate reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). It is becoming increasingly clear that the antiatherogenic effects of HDL are not only dependent on its concentration in circulating blood but also on its biological 'quality'. This review summarizes our current understanding of how the biological activities of individual subclasses of HDL particles contribute to overall HDL performance in RCT. Recent work indicates that apolipoprotein A-I-containing nascent HDL particles are heterogeneous and that such particles exert different effects on the RCT pathway. RCT from macrophages has been examined in detail in mice and the roles of plasma factors (lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase, cholesterol ester transfer protein, phospholipid transfer protein) and cell factors (ATP-binding cassette transporter A1, ATP-binding cassette transporter G1, scavenger receptor class B type 1) have been evaluated. Manipulation of such factors has consistent effects on RCT and atherosclerosis, but the level of plasma HDL does not reliably predict the degree of RCT. Furthermore, HDL cholesterol or apolipoprotein A-I levels do not necessarily correlate with the magnitude of cholesterol efflux from macrophages; more understanding of the contributions of specific HDL subspecies is required. The antiatherogenic quality of HDL is defined by the functionality of HDL subspecies. In the case of RCT, the rate of cholesterol movement through the pathway is critical and the contributions of particular types of HDL particles to this process are becoming better defined.",Rothblat GH; Phillips MC,Current opinion in lipidology,2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20480549/,1,0,0,0,0,0
20133466,Update in vitamin D.,"The past decade, particularly the last 18 months, witnessed a vigorous increase in interest in vitamin D from both the lay and biomedical worlds. Much of the growing interest in vitamin D is powered by new data being extracted from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The newest statistics demonstrate that more than 90% of the pigmented populace of the United States (Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians) now suffer from vitamin D insufficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D <30 ng/ml), with nearly three fourths of the white population in this country also being vitamin D insufficient. This represents a near doubling of the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency seen just 10 yr ago in the same population. This review attempts to provide some explanation for: 1) the rapid decline in vitamin D status in the United States; 2) the adverse impact of vitamin D insufficiency on skeletal, infectious/inflammatory, and metabolic health in humans; and 3) the therapeutic rationale and reliable means for vigorous supplementation of our diets with vitamin D.",Adams JS; Hewison M,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20133466/,1,0,0,0,0,0
19909347,Common trends in mutualism revealed by model associations between invertebrates and bacteria.,"Mutually beneficial interactions between microorganisms and animals are a conserved and ubiquitous feature of biotic systems. In many instances animals, including humans, are dependent on their microbial associates for nutrition, defense, or development. To maintain these vital relationships, animals have evolved processes that ensure faithful transmission of specific microbial symbionts between generations. Elucidating mechanisms of transmission and symbiont specificity has been aided by the study of experimentally tractable invertebrate animals with diverse and highly evolved associations with microorganisms. Here, we review several invertebrate model systems that contribute to our current understanding of symbiont transmission, recognition, and specificity. Although the details of transmission and symbiont selection vary among associations, comparisons of diverse mutualistic associations are revealing a number of common themes, including restriction of symbiont diversity during transmission and glycan-lectin interactions during partner selection and recruitment.",Chaston J; Goodrich-Blair H,FEMS microbiology reviews,2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19909347/,1,0,0,0,0,0

These infections cause diseases that are responsible for enormous levels of morbidity and mortality, delays in the physical development of children, loss of productivity among the workforce, and maintenance of poverty. Genomes of the major helminth species that affect humans, and many others of agricultural and veterinary significance, are now the subject of intensive genome sequencing and annotation. Draft genome sequences of the filarial worm Brugia malayi and two of the human schistosomes, Schistosoma japonicum and S. mansoni, are now available, among others. These genome data will provide the basis for a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in helminth nutrition and metabolism, host-dependent development and maturation, immune evasion, and evolution.

19765348,Culture for genetic manipulation of developmental stages of Schistosoma mansoni.,"Genomes of the major human helminth parasites, and indeed many others of agricultural significance, are now the research focus of intensive genome sequencing and annotation. A draft genome sequence of the filarial parasite Brugia malayi was reported in 2007 and draft genomes of two of the human schistosomes, Schistosoma japonicum and S. mansoni reported in 2009. These genome data provide the basis for a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in schistosome nutrition and metabolism, host-dependent development and maturation, immune evasion and invertebrate evolution. In addition, new potential vaccine candidates and drug targets will likely be predicted. However, testing these predictions is often not straightforward with schistosomes because of the difficulty and expense in maintenance of the developmental cycle. To facilitate this goal, several developmental stages can be maintained in vitro for shorter or longer intervals of time, and these are amenable to manipulation. Our research interests focus on experimental studies of schistosome gene functions, and more recently have focused on development of transgenesis and RNA interference with the longer term aim of heritable gene manipulation. Here we review methods to isolate and culture developmental stages of Schistosoma mansoni, including eggs, sporocysts, schistosomules and adults, in particular as these procedures relate to approaches for gene manipulation. We also discuss recent advances in genetic manipulation of schistosomes including the deployment of square wave electroporation to introduce reporter genes into cultured schistosomes.",Mann VH; Morales ME; Rinaldi G; Brindley PJ,Parasitology,2009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19765348/,1,0,0,0,0,0
19594965,Overview of methods used to evaluate the adequacy of nutrient intakes for individuals and populations.,"The objective of the present paper is to review the methods of measuring micronutrient intake adequacy for individuals and for populations in order to ascertain best practice. A systematic review was conducted to locate studies on the methodological aspects of measuring nutrient adequacy. The results showed that for individuals, qualitative methods (to find probability of adequacy) and quantitative methods (to find confidence of adequacy) have been proposed for micronutrients where there is enough data to set an average nutrient requirement (ANR). If micronutrients do not have ANR, an adequate intake (AI) is often defined and can be used to assess adequacy, provided the distribution of daily intake over a number of days is known. The probability of an individual's intake being excessive can also be compared with the upper level of safe intake and the confidence of this estimate determined in a similar way. At the population level, adequacy can be judged from the ANR using the probability approach or its short cut - the estimated average requirement cut-point method. If the micronutrient does not have an ANR, adequacy cannot be determined from the average intake and must be expressed differently. The upper level of safe intake can be used for populations in a similar way to that of individuals. All of the methodological studies reviewed were from the American continent and all used the methodology described in the Institute of Medicine publications. The present methodology should now be adapted for use in Europe.",Román-Viñas B; Serra-Majem L; Ribas-Barba L; Ngo J; García-Alvarez A; Wijnhoven TM; Tabacchi G; Branca F; de Vries J; de Groot LC,The British journal of nutrition,2009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19594965/,0,1,0,0,0,0

19493663,Docosahexaenoic acid: measurements in food and dietary exposure.,"The Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) were established to be an indicator of adequacy of dietary nutrients as well as providing levels for adequacy in reducing risk of chronic diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes mellitus, etc. One particular nutrient that is increasingly discussed as a potential candidate for the generation of a DRI is the omega-3 (n-3) fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) due to its potential benefits in reducing risk for cardiovascular disease, role in resolution of inflammation, its importance in cognitive function in infants and inhibiting the progression of neurodegenerative diseases in the elderly. Each reference value refers to and is predicated on estimates of daily nutrient intake and the goal of this paper is to review these intakes. The confidence of these values is critical in establishing dose-response relationships. This paper reports intake values for DHA and examines how these data were generated and the relative confidence in these values. The adult US population is estimated to consume 80-100 mg/d of DHA based on a nationally representative sample of > 8400 individuals as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). This value and those presented for women and men at various ages appear reasonable and should be used as the basis for establishing an Adequate Intake (AI) for DHA.",Whelan J; Jahns L; Kavanagh K,"Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids",2009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19493663/,1,0,0,0,0,0

In the absence of disease, synoviocytes produce factors that provide nutrition and lubrication for the surrounding cartilage tissue; few cellular infiltrates are seen in the synovium. In RA, however, macrophages, neutrophils, T cells and B cells infiltrate the synovium and produce cytokines, chemokines and degradative enzymes that promote inflammation and joint destruction. In addition, the synovial lining expands owing to the proliferation of synoviocytes and infiltration of inflammatory cells to form a pannus, which invades the surrounding bone and cartilage. Many of these cell responses are regulated by tyrosine kinases that operate in specific signaling pathways, and inhibition of a number of these kinases might be expected to provide benefit in RA.",D'Aura Swanson C; Paniagua RT; Lindstrom TM; Robinson WH,Nature reviews.

19141351,"The role of the high-affinity IgE receptor, FcepsilonRI, in eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases.","Primary eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases (EGIDs) are a heterogeneous group of diseases including eosinophilic esophagitis, eosinophilic gastritis, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, eosinophilic enteritis, and eosinophilic colitis. The unifying hallmark and diagnostic marker of EGIDs is an eosinophil-rich inflammatory infiltrate of the GI mucosa, in the absence of known causes for eosinophilia. The etiology of EGIDs is not yet fully understood. The pathogenesis however seems to involve a complex interplay of genetic predisposition, exposure to food- and environmental allergens and IgE-mediated activation of the immune system. Accumulating evidence relates EGIDs to the group of T-helper (Th) 2 mediated immune disorders, like IgE-mediated allergy. In this article we discuss a possible role of IgE-mediated immune-activation via the high affinity receptor for IgE, FcepsilonRI, in the pathogenesis of primary EGIDs. Beyond its defined role in type I allergic reactions, we here hypothesize that activation of tetrameric FcepsilonRI on mast cells and basophils as well as trimeric FcepsilonRI on human eosinophils and antigen presenting cells in the gastrointestinal mucosa is critically involved in the pathology of EGIDs. We also discuss how IgE-independent triggering of FcepsilonRI could be a mechanisms responsible for activation of the immune system in patients with EGID.",Dehlink E; Fiebiger E,Immunology and allergy clinics of North America,2009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19141351/,1,0,0,0,0,0
18978536,Development of protease inhibitors for protozoan infections.,"To highlight the promise of parasite proteases as targets for development of new antiparasitic chemotherapy. Proteolytic enzymes play key roles in the life cycle of protozoan parasites or the pathogenesis of diseases they produce. These roles include processing of host or parasite surface proteins for invasion of host cells, digestion of host proteins for nutrition, and inactivation of host immune defense mediators. Drug development for other markets has shown that proteases are druggable targets, and protease inhibitors are now licensed or in clinical development to treat hypertension, diabetes, thrombosis, osteoporosis, infectious diseases, and cancer. Several protease targets have been validated by genetic or chemical knockout in protozoan parasites. Many other parasite proteases appear promising as targets, but require more work for validation, or to identify viable drug leads. Because homologous proteases function as key enzymes in several parasites, targeting these proteases may allow development of a single compound, or a set of similar compounds, that target multiple diseases including malaria, trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, toxoplasmosis, cryptosporidiosis, and amebiasis. Proteases have been validated as targets in a number of parasitic infections. Proteases are druggable targets as evidenced by effective antiprotease drugs for the treatment of many human diseases including hypertension and AIDS. Future drug development targeting parasite proteases will be aided by the strong foundation of biochemical, structural, and computational databases already published or available online.",McKerrow JH; Rosenthal PJ; Swenerton R; Doyle P,Current opinion in infectious diseases,2008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18978536/,1,0,0,0,0,0
18683027,The influence of children's diet on their cognition and behavior.,"The rapid growth of the brain and its high metabolic rate suggests that it is reasonable to consider whether their diet may influence the cognitive development of children. To date although there are few nutritional recommendations that can be made with confidence, there is a growing body of evidence that diet can influence the development and functioning of the brain. Several lines of evidence support the view that the diet of the mother during pregnancy, and the diet of the infant in the perinatal period, have long-term consequences. The provision of fatty acids has been the most studied aspect of nutrition, although the evidence is lacking that supplementation has long-term benefits. There is increasing evidence that the missing of breakfast has negative consequences late in the morning and a working hypothesis is that meals of a low rather than high glycemic load are beneficial.

18767337,Vitamin D and living in northern latitudes--an endemic risk area for vitamin D deficiency.,"To review the current literature on the health effects of vitamin D, especially the effects on inhabitants living in the northern latitudes. Literature review. The scientific literature concerning health effects of vitamin D was reviewed and the current dietary recommendations for inhabitants living in northern latitudes were discussed. Vitamin D is a steroid-structured hormone produced in the skin upon exposure to UVB-radiation or obtained from certain food products (for example, liver). Its production is mediated by the vitamin D receptor, which belongs to the nuclear receptor family, and exerts its function as a transcription factor regulating several target genes. Active metabolites of vitamin D play an important role in calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Deficiency of vitamin D results in diminished bone mineralization and an increased risk of fractures. In addition, vitamin D is connected to a variety of other diseases that include different cancer types, muscular weakness, hypertension, autoimmune diseases, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, schizophrenia and depression. Vitamin D plays a fundamental role in calcium and phosphate homeostasis. A deficiency of vitamin D has been attributed to several diseases. Since its production in the skin depends on exposure to UVB-radiation via the sunlight, the level of vitamin D is of crucial importance for the health of inhabitants who live in the Nordic latitudes where there is diminished exposure to sunlight during the winter season. Therefore, fortification or supplementation of vitamin D is necessary for most of the people living in the northern latitudes during the winter season to maintain adequate levels of circulating 25(OH)D3 to maintain optimal body function and prevent diseases.",Huotari A; Herzig KH,International journal of circumpolar health,2008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18767337/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Yet, a rate-limiting step in achieving normal nutrition may be impaired absorptive function due to multiple repeated enteric infections. This is especially problematic in children whose diets are marginal. In malnourished individuals, the infections are even more devastating. This review documents the evidence that intestinal infections lead to malnutrition and that malnutrition worsens intestinal infections. The clinical data presented here derive largely from long-term cohort studies that are supported by controlled animal studies. Also reviewed are the mechanisms by which enteric infections lead to undernutrition and by which malnutrition worsens enteric infections, with implications for potential novel interventions. Further intervention studies are needed to document the relevance of these mechanisms and, most importantly, to interrupt the vicious diarrhea-malnutrition cycle so children may develop their full potential.",Guerrant RL; Oriá RB; Moore SR; Oriá MO; Lima AA,Nutrition reviews,2008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18752473/,1,0,0,0,0,0
18715159,Cryptosporidiosis in children in Sub-Saharan Africa: a lingering challenge.,"Hospital- and community-based studies in sub-Saharan Africa document a high prevalence of cryptosporidiosis in children aged 6-36 months, particularly among those who are malnourished or positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and during rainy seasons. This is despite advances in developed countries that have curbed the incidence of cryptosporidiosis in the general and HIV-positive populations. Transmission in sub-Saharan Africa appears to occur predominantly through an anthroponotic cycle. The preponderance of Cryptosporidium hominis, given its limited host range, and the dominance of the more ubiquitous Cryptosporidium parvum after coexposure to both species, however, suggest that the current knowledge of transmission is incomplete. Given the poor sanitation and hygiene, limited availability of antiretrovirals, and the high prevalence of cryptosporidiosis in children-independent of HIV infection-in this region, effective control measures for cryptosporidiosis are desperately needed. Molecular targets from the recently sequenced parasite genome should be exploited to develop an effective and safe treatment for children.",Mor SM; Tzipori S,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,2008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18715159/,1,0,0,0,0,0
18375242,Comprehensive lipid management versus aggressive low-density lipoprotein lowering to reduce cardiovascular risk.,"Five lines of evidence justify comprehensive lipoprotein management over aggressive low-density lipoprotein (LDL) lowering alone in most cases of cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. First, lipoprotein lipid transport consists of a single, recycling system involving very-low-density lipoprotein, LDL, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Single lipid interventions affect all lipoprotein classes to varying degrees. These effects can be expanded by using different drug classes in combination. Second, observational studies support the unitary nature of lipoprotein risk. A family of curves describes increasing CVD risk from increasing LDL as other risk factors are present. Conversely, a family of curves describes increasing CVD risk from decreasing levels of HDL in mirror image to LDL. The LDL and HDL risks are additive. Third, clinical trials that raise HDL and lower triglyceride ameliorate CVD, as does lowering LDL. Lowering LDL prevents heart disease, but by only 22%-36% with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor therapy. Studies indicate that better CVD prevention is obtained when drugs for triglyceride and HDL reduction are combined with LDL reduction. Fourth, HDL and its apolipoprotein (apo), apo A-I, as well as apo A-I analogues, decrease atherosclerosis. Each modality decreases atherosclerosis in animal models, and apo A-I Milano acutely decreases human coronary luminal stenosis. Apo A-I analogues have similar promise. Fifth, combined hyperlipidemia is the most common lipid disorder, has the strongest risk for CVD, and combines elevated LDL, hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL. This condition requires the comprehensive treatment approach described above. In conclusion, 5 lines of evidence justify comprehensive diet and drug treatment for combined hyperlipidemia and, at lesser LDL elevations, the atherogenic dyslipidemias of obesity, diabetes mellitus, and the metabolic syndrome.",Knopp RH; Paramsothy P; Atkinson B; Dowdy A,The American journal of cardiology,2008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18375242/,1,0,0,0,0,0

17966439,Reverse cholesterol transport and atherosclerosis. A mini review.,"Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is a complex process ensuring the efflux of cholesterol from peripheral cells and its transport back in the liver for its metabolism and biliary excretion. Cholesterol efflux results by the interaction of a cellular free cholesterol and phospholipid transporter, the ABC-AI, with lipid poor apoAI, endowed HDL particles. The free cholesterol taken up by HDL is then esterified by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and the hydrophobic cholesteryl esters are retained into the core of HDL, so that new cholesterol molecules can be translocated on the HDL surface. The generated cholesteryl esters are partially transferred to triglyceride rich apoB containing lipoprotein through a nonenzymatic process mediated by cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) in exchange for triglyceride. The hepatic uptake of the cholesterol released from peripheral cells may thus proceed via an HDL-receptor, the SR-BI and through the LDL receptor route. Hepatic lipase (HL) facilitates the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters by the hepatocytes by exerting a lipolytic effect and a ligand-binding effect, bridging the lipoprotein particles to the heparan sulfate proteoglycans on cells surface and allowing the transcytosis of cholesteryl esters. Studies on genetically modified animals and on humans with severe genetic deficiencies demonstrated that abnormalities of the various components of RCT would accelerate atherogenesis. Clinical studies revealed that the development of coronary artery disease (CAD) may by delayed by increased HL activity in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (heterozygotes), while in hypertriglyceridemic patients an increased plasma CETP and HL levels would favor the generation of less lipidated HDL and of small dense atherogenic LDL particles.",Cucuianu M; Coca M; Hâncu N,Romanian journal of internal medicine = Revue roumaine de medecine interne,2007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17966439/,1,0,0,0,0,0

17603919,[Do we still have glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency?].,"Adrenal insufficiency (AI) induced by glucocorticoids was first described more than 50 years ago in patients undergoing surgical stress. Although considered the most frequent cause of AI, the true incidence of this complication of glucocorticoid treatment remains unknown. No factors are known to predict AI after glucocorticoid treatment. In particular, neither the dose nor the duration of treatment seems predictive. The minimum dose of cortisol necessary for the body to cope with medical or surgical stress is unknown. The adrenocorticotropin test is often used during corticosteroid withdrawal because it is well correlated with adrenal response to surgical stress, but not with clinical events. Studies over the past 15 years have shown that the perioperative risk of AI has been overestimated and that hydrocortisone doses should be decreased. A prospective study of patients after steroid withdrawal is the only means of assessing the true incidence of this complication to propose a rational strategy to prevent it.",Goichot B; Vinzio S; Luca F; Schlienger JL,"Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)",2006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17603919/,1,0,0,0,0,0
17507729,"Calcium supplementation in clinical practice: a review of forms, doses, and indications.","Most Americans do not meet the adequate intake (AI) for calcium; calcium supplements can help meet requirements. Calcium supplementation has been found to be beneficial for bone health in children, young adults, and menopausal women. In addition to calcium, vitamin D is necessary for bone health and is generally deficient in the industrialized world. Calcium from carbonate and citrate are the most common forms of calcium supplements. Calcium carbonate, the most cost-effective form, should be taken with a meal to ensure optimal absorption. Calcium citrate can be taken without food and is the supplement of choice for individuals with achlorhydria or who are taking histamine-2 blockers or protein-pump inhibitors. Calcium lactate and calcium gluconate are less concentrated forms of calcium and are not practical oral supplements. Research on hydroxyapatite as a source of calcium is limited, so this form of calcium is not recommended. The maximum dose of elemental calcium that should be taken at a time is 500 mg. U.S. Pharmacopeia-verified calcium supplements meet vigorous manufacturing and quality requirements. Absorption from calcium-fortified beverages varies and in general is not equal to that of milk. Potential adverse effects of calcium supplementation include gastrointestinal complaints. Renal calculi in most studies have not been associated with calcium supplementation. The risk of advanced and fatal prostate cancer has been associated with calcium intakes from food or supplements in amounts >1500 mg/d.",Straub DA,Nutrition in clinical practice : official publication of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition,2007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17507729/,1,0,0,0,0,0
17449602,Selenium and vitamin E status: impact on viral pathogenicity.,"Selenium (Se), an essential trace element, and vitamin E, a lipid soluble antioxidant, are important mediators for protection against oxidative stress. Recent work has demonstrated that deficiencies in either Se or vitamin E result in increased viral pathogenicity and altered immune responses. Furthermore, deficiencies in either Se or vitamin E results in specific viral mutations, changing relatively benign viruses into virulent ones. Thus, host nutritional status should be considered a driving force for the emergence of new viral strains or newly pathogenic strains of known viruses.",Beck MA,The Journal of nutrition,2007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17449602/,1,0,0,0,0,0

17284768,Gastrointestinal development and meeting the nutritional needs of premature infants.,"The fear of necrotizing enterocolitis and feeding intolerance are major factors inhibiting the use of the enteral route as the primary means of nourishing premature infants. Parenteral nutrition may help to meet many of the nutritional needs of these infants, but has significant detrimental side effects that include intestinal atrophy, sepsis, and increased susceptibility to inflammatory stimuli and systemic inflammatory responses. Being able to minimize the use of the parenteral route and still maintain appropriate nutrition safely would be a major advance in neonatology. At the basis of our inability to use the enteral route is a poorly understood immature gastrointestinal tract. Approaches such as minimal enteral nutrition or trophic feedings may partially alleviate these problems. However, if we are to progress in greater utilization of the gastrointestinal tract, other factors need to be considered. These include the macronutrient composition of minimal enteral or trophic feedings and the microecology of the intestinal lumen. Some of the developmental aspects of the intestine, which include intestinal growth, motor activity, barrier and other innate immune functions, and the microecology of the developing intestine, are briefly reviewed here. The purpose of this review is to suggest important areas of future research in neonatal and developmental gastroenterology that could affect several conditions that are related to immaturity of the gastrointestinal tract.",Neu J,The American journal of clinical nutrition,2007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17284768/,1,0,0,0,0,0

17071367,The medically complex premature infant in primary care.,The survival rate of the smallest and youngest of premature infants has continued to improve as medical technology has progressed. The current edge of viability is represented by infants born at 23 to 25 weeks' gestation. Neonatal survival of infants at 23 weeks' gestation ranges from 11% to 30%. Survival to hospital discharge for infants ranging from 23 to 26 weeks' gestation is about 70%; 30% to 50% of these infants have moderate to severe disability. Nurse practitioners and physicians will be meeting these young infants in primary care offices after they have been discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit.

17045076,A moderate-fat diet for combined hyperlipidemia and metabolic syndrome.,"A low-fat diet is recommended for hyperlipidemia. However, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) responses depend on the type of hyperlipidemia (ie, simple hypercholesterolemia or combined hyperlipidemia). In combined hyperlipidemia, which is typical of patients with metabolic syndrome, LDL levels are only one third as responsive to fat and cholesterol as simple hypercholesterolemia. The diminished dietary sensitivity of combined hyperlipidemia is explained by diminished intestinal absorption of cholesterol, a feature of metabolic syndrome. In turn, combined hyperlipidemia is caused by heightened lipid secretion by the liver. A moderate-fat, moderate-carbohydrate diet employing allowable fats has the promise of reducing endogenous lipoprotein production in combined hyperlipidemia. Triglyceride, LDL, and small-dense LDL should be lower, and high-density lipoprotein, apoprotein A-I, and buoyant LDL should be higher. A test of this dietary strategy on lipoproteins and downstream benefits on inflammatory mediators, oxidative stress, and vascular reactivity is now underway.",Knopp RH; Fish B; Dowdy A; Retzlaff B; Walden C; Rusanu I; Paramsothy P,Current atherosclerosis reports,2006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17045076/,1,0,0,0,0,0
17009087,Hepatitis C infection in dialysis patients: a link to poor clinical outcome?,"Among the 350,000 maintenance dialysis patients in the USA, the mortality rate is high (20-23% per year) as is the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (5-15%). An additional same number of dialysis patients in the USA may be infected with HCV but have undetectable HCV antibodies. Almost half of all deaths in dialysis patients, including HCV-infected patients, are due to cardiovascular disease. Since over two-thirds of dialysis patients die within 5 years of initiating dialysis and because markers of malnutrition-inflammation complex syndrome (MICS), rather than traditional cardiovascular risk factors, are among the strongest predictors of early death in these patients, the impact of HCV infection on nutritional status and inflammation may be a main cause of poor survival in this population. Based on data from our cross-sectional and limited longitudinal studies, we hypothesize that HCV infection confounds the association between MICS and clinical outcomes in dialysis patients and, by doing so, leads to higher short-term cardiovascular events and death. Understanding the natural history of HCV and its association with inflammation, nutrition and outcomes in dialysis patients may lead to testing more effective anti-HCV management strategies in this and other similar patient populations, providing benefits not only for HCV infection but the detrimental consequences associated with this infection. In this article, we review the link between the HCV infection and mortality in dialysis patients and compare HCV antibody to molecular methods to detect HCV infection in these individuals.",Kalantar-Zadeh K; Daar ES; Eysselein VE; Miller LG,International urology and nephrology,2006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17009087/,1,0,0,0,0,1
16996705,The effect of nutritional management of the dairy cow on reproductive efficiency.,"The cause of low fertility in dairy cows is multifactorial. Poor nutrition during the dry and early postpartum periods results in reduced glucose, insulin, insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) and low LH pulse frequency with concomitant increases in beta-hydroxy butyrate, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and triacylglycerol. Cows must mobilize large lipid, but also some protein reserves, with a consequent increased incidence of such metabolic disorders as hypocalcaemia, acidosis, ketosis, fatty liver and displaced abomasums. The occurrence of milk fever and ketosis affects uterine contractions, delays calving and increases the risk of retained foetal membranes (RFM) and endometritis. The nutritional risk factors that cause RFM are hypocalcaemia, high body condition score (BCS) at calving and deficiencies in Vitamin E and selenium. The risk factors for endometritis are hypocalcaemia, RFM, high triacylglycerol and NEFA. Thus, metabolic disorders predispose cows to gynaecological disorders, thereby reducing reproductive efficiency. Cows that are overconditioned at calving or those that lose excess body weight are more likely to have a prolonged interval to first oestrus, thereby prolonging days open. Nutritionally induced postpartum anoestrus is characterized by turnover of dominant follicles incapable of producing sufficient oestradiol to induce ovulation due to reduced LH pulse frequency. High nutrition can also increase metabolic clearance rate of steroid hormones such as progesterone or oestradiol. Lower concentrations of oestradiol on the day of oestrus are highly correlated with the occurrence of suboestrus, thereby making the detection of oestrus in high yielding cows even more difficult. Nutrition also affects conception rate (CR) to AI. Cows that develop hypocalcaemia, ketosis, acidosis or displaced abomasums have lower CRs and take longer to become pregnant. Excessive loss of BCS and excess protein content of the ration can reduce CR while supplemental fats that attenuate the production of F2alpha can improve CR. The increased metabolic clearance rate of progesterone (P4), which decreases blood concentrations during early embryo cleavage up to the blastocyst stage is associated with decreased CRs. In conclusion, poor nutritional management of the dairy cow, particularly before and after calving, is a key driver of infertility.",Roche JF,Animal reproduction science,2006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16996705/,1,0,0,0,0,0
16865322,Peripherally inserted central venous catheters are not superior to central venous catheters in the acute care of surgical patients on the ward.,"Peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICC) have supplanted central venous catheters (CVC) for the administration of intravenous antibiotics and total parenteral nutrition to patients in our hospital. From the literature, it appears that this change has occurred in a number of other surgical units. Accounting for the change are the expected advantages of low complication rates at insertion, prolonged use without complications and interruption, and cost- and time-savings. We have proceeded with a review of the literature to understand and justify this change in practice. Our hypothesis was that the routine adoption of PICC instead of CVC for the acute care of surgical patients has occurred in the absence of strong scientific evidence. Our aim was to compare the associated infectious, thrombotic, phlebitic, and other common complications, as well as PICC and CVC durability. Articles concerning various aspects of PICC- and CVC-related complications in the acute care of adult patients were selected from the literature. Studies were excluded when they primarily addressed the use of long-term catheters, outpatient care, and pediatric patients. Data were extracted from 48 papers published between 1979 and 2004. Our results show that infectious complications do not significantly differ between PICC and CVC. Thrombotic complications appear to be more significant with PICC and to occur early after catheterization. Phlebitic complications accounted for premature catheter removal in approximately 6% of PICC. Finally, prospective data suggest that approximately 40% of PICC will have to be removed before completion of therapy, possibly more often and earlier than CVC. We believe that there is no clear evidence that PICC is superior to CVC in acute care settings. Each approach offers its own advantages and a different profile of complications. Therefore, the choice of central venous access should be individualized for surgical patients on the ward. More comparative prospective studies are needed to document the advantages of PICC over CVC.",Turcotte S; Dubé S; Beauchamp G,World journal of surgery,2006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16865322/,1,0,0,0,0,0

16815124,"Nutrigenetics, plasma lipids, and cardiovascular risk.","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) results from complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. The evidence supports that gene-environment interactions modulate plasma lipid concentrations and potentially CVD risk. Several genes (eg, apolipoprotein A-I and A-IV, apolipoprotein E, and hepatic lipase) are providing proof-of-concept for the application of genetics in the context of personalized nutrition for CVD prevention. The spectrum of candidate genes has been expanding to incorporate those involved in intracellular lipid metabolism and especially those transcription factors (ie, peroxisome proliferator activator receptors) that act as sensors of nutrients in the cell (eg, polyunsaturated fatty acids) to trigger metabolic responses through activation of specific sets of genes. However, current knowledge is still very limited and so is the potential benefit of its application to clinical practice. Thinking needs to evolve from simple scenarios (eg, one single dietary component, a single nucleotide polymorphism and risk factor) to more realistic situations involving multiple interactions. One of the first situations where personalized nutrition is likely to be beneficial is in patients with dyslipidemia who require special intervention with dietary treatment. This process could be more efficient if the recommendations were carried out based on genetic and molecular knowledge. Moreover, adherence to dietary advice may increase when it is supported with information based on nutritional genomics, and a patient believes the advice is personalized. However, a number of important changes in the provision of health care are needed to achieve the potential benefits associated with this concept, including a teamwork approach with greater integration among physicians, food and nutrition professionals, and genetic counselors.",Ordovas JM,Journal of the American Dietetic Association,2006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16815124/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Findings indicate that although the primary health risk for the AI population around 1970 was undernutrition, now there is an obesity epidemic among all age groups that is associated with a loss of traditional food practices and reduced physical activity. Deaths caused by cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and cancer have outpaced death from infectious disease. With abundant high-energy foods and limited physical activity, the acculturated environment has resulted in obesity and increased mortality from chronic diseases.

16756533,A systematic review of multivitamin and multimineral supplementation for infection.,"Infections are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Micronutrients have important functions in the body's immune system. This systematic review examined the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on whether multivitamin and multimineral supplementation is effective in reducing infection. Electronic databases searched: Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, EMBASE, MEDLINE, BIOSIS, CAB abstracts. Hand searching of nutrition journals and reference lists was carried out. RCTs and quasi-randomized trials of supplementation of adults with at least two vitamins or minerals or a combination were selected. Study results were combined in meta-analysis plots where appropriate. Twenty studies were included in the review. Small numbers were available for each meta-analysis. Results are presented here without the Chandra group studies. No significant difference was found in the number of episodes of infection in older people (>or = 65 years) between those supplemented and those not supplemented; (WMD) 0.06 [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.04, 0.16], P = 0.25. In other adults groups, there were significantly less episodes of infection in those supplemented; (WMD) -1.20 (95% CI -2.08, -0.32), P = 0.008. There was no significant difference between those older people supplemented and those not supplemented in the number with at least one infection; relative risk (RR) 0.98 (95% CI 0.86, 1.11), P = 0.77. Similarly, there was no significant difference in the numbers in other adult groups who had at least one episode of infection between those supplemented and those taking placebo; (RR) 0.81 (95% CI 0.65, 1.00), P = 0.06. Subgroup analyses suggested that supplemented people aged 65 years or over may benefit more if they are undernourished and supplemented for over 6 months, WMD -0.67 infections (95% CI -1.24, -0.10), P = 0.02.

In the HIV-infected population, weight loss is associated with lower CD4+ cell counts and is an independent predictor of mortality. The etiology of weight loss and wasting is complex and multifactorial. We discuss, on the basis of a large longitudinal cohort that examined nutritional status in HIV infection, data on weight loss and wasting from the present clinical era. The definition, prevalence, and significance of HIV-associated weight loss and wasting are summarized. The etiology of weight loss is discussed for 2 main categories: inadequate nutrient intake and altered metabolism. Finally, studies of interventions to treat HIV-associated weight loss and wasting are discussed. This information is intended to raise awareness among health care providers of HIV-infected patients that weight loss and wasting remain important acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-defining conditions, despite the advent of HAART.",Mangili A; Murman DH; Zampini AM; Wanke CA,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,2006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16477562/,1,0,0,0,0,1

Research efforts initially focused on characterization of the clinical, endoscopic, and histologic features of this disorder. In the last 3 years, the research focus has evolved into understanding its immunologic and demographic features as well as the development of efficacious therapies. Population-based demographic studies have documented the unique epidemiologic parameters of eosinophilic esophagitis, some of its natural history, and its increasing frequency. Basic research efforts have identified cytokines relevant toward development of eosinophilic esophagitis, including interleukin-5 and interleukin-13. Clinical efforts have established the efficacy of dietary and medical treatments. Some treatments result in symptomatic improvement with ongoing inflammation, so a debate is ensuing over the long-term effect of asymptomatic esophageal inflammation.

16243964,The effect of select nutrients on serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I levels.,"One of the factors contributing to the increased risk of developing premature atherosclerosis is low plasma concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDLc). Multiple potential mechanisms account for the cardioprotective effects of HDL and its main protein apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I). The low plasma concentrations of HDL could be the result of increased fractional clearance and reduced expression of apo A-I. To this end, nutrients play an important role in modulating the fractional clearance rate, as well as the rate of apo A-I gene expression. Because medical nutrition therapy constitutes the cornerstone of management of dyslipidemias, it is essential to understand the mechanisms underlying the changes in HDL level in response to alterations in dietary intake. In this review, we will discuss the effect of select nutrients on serum HDLc and apo A-I levels. Specifically, we will review the literature on the effect of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and ketones, as well as some of the nutrient-related metabolites, such as glucosamine and the prostanoids, on apo A-I gene expression. Because there are multiple mechanisms involved in the regulation of serum HDLc levels, changes in gene transcription do not necessarily correlate with clinical observations on serum levels of HDLc.",Mooradian AD; Haas MJ; Wong NC,Endocrine reviews,2005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16243964/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The diagnosis and treatment are difficult to made. It is very dangerous if the treatment is incorrect. This study was to analyze the causes, preventive measures, diagnosis methods and standard, and appropriate treatments of this kind of fistula. Clinical data of 5 patients who suffered cervical anastomotic fistula contaminating mediastinum or pleural cavity after esophagogastrostomy, treated in our hospital, were retrospectively analyzed; the related literature was reviewed. The morbidity of this kind fistula was 1.83%(4/219) in our hospital. All the 5 patients suffered fistula 1-13 days after esophagogastrostomy; bronchopleural fistula occurred in 2 patients. The main causes of this kind of anastomotic fistula were hypertensive anastomosis, low anastomotic location, incomplete suture of thorax-esophagus outlet, defection of surgical technique, and so on. The fistula could be diagnosed correctly when the patient suffered high fever, dyspnea and thoracalgia after operation, with cervical anastomotic external fistula which could not been healed when the wound was opened, X-ray-showed widened mediastinum and hydropneumothorax, and drainage, esophagoraphy and CT-confirmed anastomotic fistula. All patients were cured in a short term with sufficient drainage and irrigation, enough nutrition, appropriate use of antibiotics, and pyothorax dissection and muscle flaps transplantation for bronchopleural fistula.

For individuals, the target for nutrient intakes is usually the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA); for nutrients without an RDA, the Adequate Intake (AI) can be used.

16148539,The role of fatty acid binding proteins in metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis.,"The global prevalence of obesity is increasing epidemically. Obesity causes an array of health problems, reduces life expectancy, and costs over US dollar 100 billion annually. More than a quarter of the population suffers from an aggregation of co-morbidities, including obesity, atherosclerosis, insulin resistance, dyslipidemias, coagulopathies, hypertension, and a pro-inflammatory state known as the metabolic syndrome. Patients with metabolic syndrome have high risk of atherosclerosis as well as type 2 diabetes and other health problems. Like obesity, atherosclerosis has very limited therapeutic options. Fatty acid binding proteins integrate metabolic and immune responses and link the inflammatory and lipid-mediated pathways that are critical in the metabolic syndrome. This review will highlight recent studies on fatty acid binding protein-deficient models and several fatty acid binding protein-mediated pathways specifically modified in macrophages, cells that are paramount to the initiation and persistence of cardiovascular lesions. Adipocyte/macrophage fatty acid binding proteins, aP2 and mal1, act at the interface of metabolic and inflammatory pathways. These fatty acid binding proteins are involved in the formation of atherosclerosis predominantly through the direct modification of macrophage cholesterol trafficking and inflammatory responses. In addition to atherosclerosis, these fatty acid binding proteins also exert a dramatic impact on obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease. The creation of pharmacological agents to modify fatty acid binding protein function will provide tissue or cell-type-specific control of these lipid signaling pathways, inflammatory responses, atherosclerosis, and the other components of the metabolic syndrome, therefore offering a new class of multi-indication therapeutic agents.",Makowski L; Hotamisligil GS,Current opinion in lipidology,2005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16148539/,1,0,0,0,0,0
16002131,Possibilities with today's reproductive technologies.,"Reproductive efficiency is critical to economic viability for cow/calf producers; however, very few producers take advantage of available reproductive technologies that can increase profitability. Today, more opportunities are available for producers who want to capture value from known genetics. Through the use of artificial insemination (AI), the average producer has access to a wide range of high-accuracy sires that can be selected to match production goals. Systems to synchronize estrus and ovulation can now produce pregnancy rates to a single fixed-timed AI that are 10-15% greater than those of the previous generation. Increased age and weight of calves at weaning is sufficient in some situations to pay for the cost of synchronization and AI. As a result of synchronization, more cows calve early the next year and in subsequent years of synchronization. The breeding season can be shortened without reducing end-of-season pregnancy rates, since synchronized cows have one more chance to conceive than unsynchronized cows in a 22-25 day interval. Cow nutrition can be more economically and precisely managed with a shorter breeding period. Producers that establish AI programs now will be prepared to take advantage of newly identified superior genetics or other technologies, e.g. sexed semen, when they become available. Trends towards more value-based marketing and improvements in pregnancy rates from synchronization systems, make this a key time to be aware of the possibilities using reproductive technologies.",Johnson SK,Theriogenology,2005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16002131/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Since tumor-derived vascular endothelial cells chronically emerge in tumor microenvironment, their phenotypes and functions have significantly changed, including some immunologic characteristics, such as down-regulated adhesion molecules, diminished leukocyte-endothelium interactions, impaired antigen presentation, enhanced resistant activity to free radicals, and synthesis of a great amount of extracellular matrix. Because tumor-derived vascular endothelial cell is the first barrier for immune cells and immune drugs to enter tumor tissue, these changes of immunologic characteristics of tumor- derived vascular endothelial cells may be related to the mechanisms of tumor cells escaping from host's immune surveillance and immune killing. This review summarized the immunologic characteristics of tumor-derived vascular endothelial cells, and analyzed the relationship between these characteristics and tumor immune escape.",Zhang WJ; Wu LQ; Ye LY; Lou JN,Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer,2005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15890113/,1,0,0,0,0,0
15883451,Dietary Reference Intakes: development and uses for assessment of micronutrient status of women--a global perspective.,"This paper reviews the process of developing the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) and provides a synopsis of the micronutrient status of women worldwide. At a 1993 symposium held by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the Institute of Medicine (IOM), it was decided that the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) would be replaced by the DRIs, which would address several issues that the RDAs did not, including chronic disease risk reduction, upper levels for nutrients where toxicity data existed, and the possible health benefits of some food components that did not meet the traditional definition of a nutrient. Another important distinction is that because the DRIs are comprised of 4 reference values -the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR), RDA, Adequate Intake (AI), and a tolerable Upper Level (UL) -and not a single reference value like the previous RDAs, they could be used to differentiate planning from diagnosis or assessment. The latest DRIs and nutrient intakes are shown for iron, zinc, calcium, Vitamin A and folate status in women in the United States. Data on the micronutrient status of women globally are much more limited. Summary statistics on iron deficiency anemia, night blindness, and risk of zinc deficiency are summarized.",Kennedy E; Meyers L,The American journal of clinical nutrition,2005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15883451/,1,0,0,0,0,0

There are nutritional and metabolic issues that significantly impact morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected populations. In addition, malnutrition has been associated with an increased risk of transmission of HIV from infected mothers to infants, and malnutrition may further compromise HIV-infected individuals who have tuberculosis or persistent diarrheal disease. The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy will have a significant impact on the mortality of HIV, but will not completely alleviate the malnutrition associated with HIV infection in the global setting.",Wanke C,Nutrition in clinical care : an official publication of Tufts University,2005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15850234/,1,0,0,0,0,0
15722558,Thematic review series: The immune system and atherogenesis. Lipoprotein-associated inflammatory proteins: markers or mediators of cardiovascular disease?,"In humans, a chronically increased circulating level of C-reactive protein (CRP), a positive acute-phase reactant, is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. This observation has led to considerable interest in the role of inflammatory proteins in atherosclerosis. In this review, after discussing CRP, we focus on the potential role in the pathogenesis of human vascular disease of inflammation-induced proteins that are carried by lipoproteins. Serum amyloid A (SAA) is transported predominantly on HDL, and levels of this protein increase markedly during acute and chronic inflammation in both animals and humans. Increased SAA levels predict the risk of cardiovascular disease in humans. Recent animal studies support the proposal that SAA plays a role in atherogenesis. Evidence is accruing that secretory phospholipase A(2), an HDL-associated protein, and platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase, a protein associated predominantly with LDL in humans and HDL in mice, might also play roles both as markers and mediators of human atherosclerosis. In contrast to positive acute-phase proteins, which increase in abundance during inflammation, negative acute-phase proteins have received less attention. Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the major apolipoprotein of HDL, decreases during inflammation. Recent studies also indicate that HDL is oxidized by myeloperoxidase in patients with established atherosclerosis. These alterations may limit the ability of apoA-I to participate in reverse cholesterol transport. Paraoxonase-1 (PON1), another HDL-associated protein, also decreases during inflammation. PON1 is atheroprotective in animal models of hypercholesterolemia. Controversy over its utility as a marker of human atherosclerosis may reflect the fact that enzyme activity rather than blood level (or genotype) is the major determinant of cardiovascular risk. Thus, multiple lipoprotein-associated proteins that change in concentration during acute and chronic inflammation may serve as markers of cardiovascular disease. In future studies, it will be important to determine whether these proteins play a causal role in atherogenesis.",Chait A; Han CY; Oram JF; Heinecke JW,Journal of lipid research,2005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15722558/,1,0,0,0,0,0

15271441,International training programs in reproductive sciences for conservation of Latin American felids.,"Survival of the ten non-domestic felid species endemic to Latin America is imperiled by habitat loss, poaching and poor captive management. Over the past 10 years, conservation of these felids has been the primary focus of a reproductive research and training program conducted in Brazil, Mexico, and the USA. The objectives of this program were to: (1) provide intensive training in reproductive sciences to Latin American scientists, (2) conduct collaborative studies investigating basic and applied reproduction in endangered felids, and (3) establish a highly-trained scientific cohort to conduct independent conservation-based research. Four formal training courses, consisting of didactic lectures and hands-on instruction in research techniques, including semen collection, sperm cryopreservation and laparoscopic artificial insemination (AI), were taught in Brazil and Mexico between 1995 and 1998. Several of these scientists received further training in conducting fecal hormone analysis in the USA, and a number of research studies, many in collaboration with American scientists, were initiated in Latin American felids. Research findings have characterized basal reproductive traits in several felid species, including ocelots, margay, tigrinas and jaguars, and established that Latin American felids exhibit only minimal seasonal variation in most reproductive traits. Other studies have explored the impact of acute and chronic stressors on adrenocortical activity and demonstrated the importance of environmental enrichment in captivity, especially in small felids. Additional research has examined ovarian and immunological responsiveness of Latin American felids to exogenous gonadotropins and assessed the impact of nutrition on sperm production and oocyte quality. Applied reproductive studies have investigated sperm cryopreservation in both captive and wild felid populations and demonstrated the production of viable offspring in ocelots and tigrinas following laparoscopic AI. Ongoing studies are investigating the potential of in vitro fertilization (IVF), embryo cryopreservation and embryo transfer for genetic management of ocelots and tigrinas. To date, over 75 Brazilian ocelot and 50 tigrina IVF embryos have been cryopreserved and two pregnancies have been established in ocelots following transfer of frozen-thawed embryos. Findings from these studies are helping to improve husbandry, population management, and breeding of Latin American felids in captivity. Continued advances in assisted reproduction eventually may provide an alternative route for exchanging genetic material among Latin American felid populations. Most importantly, this collaborative program has been essential for building scientific capacity, within Brazil and Mexico, in establishing a core group of highly-trained reproductive biologists that will continue applying their new knowledge and skills to the conservation of Latin American felids.",Swanson WF; Brown JL,Animal reproduction science,2004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15271441/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The parasitic flukes have some unique biological features: dioecism, complex life cycles, mechanisms to avoid host immune responses, and an apparent reliance on host endocrine and immune signals to complete their development, maturation and egg production. Recently, a large dataset of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were generated from Schistosoma japonicum and Schistosoma mansoni, from which numerous novel genes were identified.

14871659,Porcine pancreatic alpha-amylase inhibition by the kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) inhibitor (alpha-AI1) and structural changes in the alpha-amylase inhibitor complex.,"Porcine pancreatic alpha-amylase (PPA) is inhibited by the red kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) inhibitor alpha-AI1 [Eur. J. Biochem. 265 (1999) 20]. Inhibition kinetics were carried out using DP 4900-amylose and maltopentaose as substrate. As shown by graphical and statistical analysis of the kinetic data, the inhibitory mode is of the mixed noncompetitive type whatever the substrate thus involving the EI, EI2, ESI and ESI2 complexes. This contrast with the E2I complex obtained in the crystal and with biophysical studies. Such difference very likely depends on the [I]/[E] ratio. At low ratio, the E2I complex is favoured; at high ratio the EI, ESI and EI2 complexes are formed. The inhibition model also differs from those previously proposed for acarbose [Eur. J. Biochem. 241 (1996) 787 and Eur. J. Biochem. 252 (1998) 100]. In particular, with alpha-AI1, the inhibition takes place only when PPA and alpha-AI are preincubated together before adding the substrate. This indicates that the abortive PPA-alphaAI1 complex is formed during the preincubation period. One additional carbohydrate binding site is also demonstrated yielding the ESI complex. Also, a second protein binding site is found in EI2 and ESI2 abortive complexes. Conformational changes undergone by PPA upon alpha-AI1 binding are shown by higher sensitivity to subtilisin attack. From X-ray analysis of the alpha-AI1-PPA complex (E2I), the major interaction occurs with two hairpin loops L1 (residues 29-46) and L2 (residues 171-189) of alpha-AI1 protruding into the V-shaped active site of PPA. The hydrolysis of alpha-AI1 that accounts for the inhibitory activity is reported.",Santimone M; Koukiekolo R; Moreau Y; Le Berre V; Rougé P; Marchis-Mouren G; Desseaux V,Biochimica et biophysica acta,2004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14871659/,1,0,0,0,0,0
14559926,Calcium intake trends and health consequences from childhood through adulthood.,"Issues involving low calcium intake and dairy product consumption are currently the focus of much debate and discussion at both the scientific and lay community levels. In this review, we examine the following major areas of interest: (1). the role of calcium intake and dairy product consumption in chronic diseases, (2). nutritional qualities of milk and other dairy products, (3). trends in calcium intake and dairy product consumption, (4). current status of calcium intakes and dairy product consumption in children, (5). tracking of calcium intake and diary product consumption, (6). the impact of school meal participation on calcium intake and dairy product consumption, (7). concerns related to calcium-fortified foods and beverages and (8). factors influencing children's milk consumption.

Haematophagous nematodes express proteases of different mechanistic classes in their intestines, many of which have proven or putative roles in degradation of haemoglobin and other proteins involved in nutrition.

12849067,High-density lipoprotein-associated apolipoprotein A-I: the missing link between infection and chronic inflammation?,"The etiology of chronic immuno-inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and atherosclerosis is far from being elucidated. It is generally accepted that multiple factors are involved in the development of such pathologies, including factors of genetic susceptibility that interact in complex ways with diverse environmental factors, i.e. gender, nutrition, environment, etc. Furthermore, infection has often been pinpointed as playing a causal role. However, no distinctive pattern has yet emerged from the tremendous number of compiled results that would provide a generally acceptable hypothesis of the etiology of immuno-inflammatory diseases, and the possibility of a persistent antigenic stimulus arising from an infection cannot be confirmed or refuted. At the cellular level, chronic inflammation is characterized by the infiltration of immuno-inflammatory cells into the target tissue, which mostly precedes tissue damage. At the inflammatory site, monocytes and T lymphocytes are in close proximity. We have demonstrated that contact-mediated activation of monocytes by stimulated T lymphocytes is a major stimulus triggering the production of large amounts of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) whose importance in chronic inflammation is well known. We recently established that high-density lipolipoprotein (HDL)-associated apolipoprotein (apo) A-I is a specific inhibitor of cytokine production in monocyte-macrophages upon contact with stimulated T cells. HDL-associated apo A-I is a negative acute-phase protein, i.e. a protein whose level is lowered by more than 25% during the acute phase. This review aims at highlighting the fact that HDL-associated apo A-I might play the role of a constitutive anti-inflammatory factor. The decrease of plasma levels of HDL-associated apo A-I upon acute inflammation may be a sign of the possible development of chronic inflammation, i.e. individuals presenting with risk factors might develop chronic inflammatory diseases after infection. We thus hypothesize that HDL-associated apo A-I might be the missing link between infection and chronic inflammation.",Burger D; Dayer JM,Autoimmunity reviews,2002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12849067/,1,0,0,0,0,0

12714034,HDL in atherosclerosis: actor or bystander?,"Despite dramatic improvement in treatments for reducing risk for coronary heart disease (CHD), it is still the leading cause of mortality in the developed world. In the past decade, a major improvement in reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol has been achieved with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins). This approach has been shown to be beneficial in both primary and secondary prevention of CHD. On the other hand, while a reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level is an independent CHD risk factor, no HDL cholesterol goal has yet been established. The Helsinki Heart Study and the Veterans Affairs High-density Lipoprotein Intervention Trial documented that increasing HDL cholesterol with gemfibrozil significantly decreases coronary events or stroke in CHD patients either with elevated non-HDL cholesterol or normal LDL cholesterol levels plus low HDL cholesterol. Investigations with statins have focused on their efficacy not only in significantly decreasing total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels but also in increasing HDL cholesterol concentrations. The two different classes of drugs (statins and fibrates) have different effects on the various HDL subspecies. As new members of these drug classes and other novel drugs are emerging, there is interest in clarifying whether HDL is only a bystander (an indicator for other CHD risk factors) or it has an active role in the development of CHD. If HDL has an active role, there is a need to determine if any HDL subspecies are protective. It is now clear that HDL plays a pivotal role in cellular cholesterol efflux via the interaction of apolipoprotein A-I with the ATP binding cassette transporter A-1. Thereafter the cholesterol is esterified by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase; HDL is remodeled by cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) and hepatic lipase. The cholesterol in HDL can either be transferred to apolipoprotein B-containing particles via CETP or delivered directly to the liver with the help of scavenger receptor B1.",Asztalos BF; Schaefer EJ,Atherosclerosis.

The lipid-binding properties of the principal HDL apolipoprotein, apo A-I, permit plasticity in HDL structure. The amphipathic alpha-helical domains that are the major element of secondary structure mediate the interaction of apo A-I with phospholipid. Low resolution models of the structures of both discoidal and spherical HDL particles are evaluated. HDL particles are dynamic in that they are being remodeled constantly in vivo by interaction with lipases, lipid transfer proteins, and cell-surface HDL receptors.

12671842,Inflammation in ESRD: causes and potential consequences.,"Malnutrition in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is characterized by hypoalbuminemia, decreased serum creatinine and prealbumin, and decreased subjective global assessment (SGA) scores. Markers of malnutrition predict mortality and correlate closely with inflammatory markers, including serum cytokines and acute phase proteins. After multiple regression analysis, markers of inflammation become stronger predictors of mortality than nutritional markers, suggesting that malnutrition is a result of inflammation. The etiology of inflammation is variable and includes vascular access infection, bioincompatible dialyzers, back filtration of nonsterile dialysate, periodontal disease, urinary tract infections, and other pyogenic infections. Renal failure also may serve to promote inflammation through protein carbonylation. Differences in care patterns of ESRD patients and genetics may contribute to inflammation as evidenced by lower levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in Asian populations. Inflammation results in loss of muscle mass and hypoalbuminemia as a consequence of its decreased synthesis and increased catabolism. Vascular disease occurs partly because of changes in lipoprotein structure and function, including oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and modification of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) by serum amyloid A (SAA) and loss of apolipoprotein A-I. Leukocyte adhesion is promoted by changes in endothelial structure and function, whereas plasma proteins associated with cardiovascular disease (fibrinogen, lipoprotein[a]; SAA) are increased. Consequences of inflammation in ESRD patients include muscle wasting, erythropoetin resistance, and vascular disease. Whereas improvements in nutrition can increase serum albumin and creatinine levels, identification and removal of the underlying cause of inflammation should be one treatment goal.",Kaysen GA; Kumar V,Journal of renal nutrition : the official journal of the Council on Renal Nutrition of the National Kidney Foundation,2003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12671842/,1,0,0,0,0,0
12615688,Importance of different pathways of cellular cholesterol efflux.,"The removal of excess free cholesterol from cells by HDL or its apolipoproteins is important for maintaining cellular cholesterol homeostasis. This process is most likely compromised in the atherosclerotic lesion because the development of atherosclerosis is associated with low HDL cholesterol. Multiple mechanisms for efflux of cell cholesterol exist. Efflux of free cholesterol via aqueous diffusion occurs with all cell types but is inefficient. Efflux of cholesterol is accelerated when scavenger receptor class-B type I (SR-BI) is present in the cell plasma membrane. Both diffusion-mediated and SR-BI-mediated efflux occur to phospholipid-containing acceptors (ie, HDL and lipidated apolipoproteins); in both cases, the flux of cholesterol is bidirectional, with the direction of net flux depending on the cholesterol gradient. The ATP-binding cassette transporter AI (ABCA1) mediates efflux of both cellular cholesterol and phospholipid. In contrast to SR-BI-mediated flux, efflux via ABCA1 is unidirectional, occurring to lipid-poor apolipoproteins. The relative importance of the SR-BI and ABCA1 efflux pathways in preventing the development of atherosclerotic plaque is not known but will depend on the expression levels of the two proteins and on the type of cholesterol acceptors available.",Yancey PG; Bortnick AE; Kellner-Weibel G; de la Llera-Moya M; Phillips MC; Rothblat GH,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12615688/,1,0,0,0,0,0

12133820,Lipoprotein metabolism in the nephrotic syndrome.,"This review covers lipids, apolipoproteins, and receptors involved in the dyslipidemia of the nephrotic syndrome in humans and in rat or mouse models of the syndrome. It emphasizes research published during the last decade, though earlier work is cited. The focus is on the biosynthesis and catabolism of the plasma lipoprotein density classes and the role of receptors and enzymes in regulating lipoprotein metabolism in nephrosis. Although the factors responsible for the initiation of the hepatic and peripheral cellular responses to proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia remain elusive, recent work highlights the increased risk of atherosclerosis and the progression of renal disease associated with nephrotic dyslipidemia. Understanding of the role of the kidney in the catabolism of apolipoproteins entering the glomerular filtrate has been enhanced by the discovery of the receptor-mediated uptake of apolipoprotein A-I, the main apoprotein of HDL.

Although micronutrient malnutrition is usually highly prevalent in malaria endemic areas, the contribution of micronutrient deficiencies to malarial anemia is often overlooked. Recent investigation suggests that micronutrients such as vitamin A, vitamin E, and zinc, may improve the morbidity of malaria through immune modulation and alteration of oxidative stress. Micronutrients are also involved in the pathogenesis of anemia and likely play a role in malarial anemia, but many clinical trials have not specifically addressed the impact of micronutrient supplementation on malarial anemia.

12023827,Gene-diet interaction and plasma lipid responses to dietary intervention.,"Strategies for disease prevention can have a major impact on people's health. However, major gaps exist in our knowledge with regard to nutritional adequacy, nutrient-disease interactions, nutrient-gene interactions, and effective strategies for implementation of dietary recommendations which have the potential to decrease the disease burden and to contribute to successful aging of the population. Coronary heart disease is one of the major causes of mortality in the world. We have sound evidence that high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease. Lipoprotein concentrations are associated with environmental variables such as diet and lifestyle, but genetics also play a significant role. We have examined polymorphisms at candidate loci to determine their usefulness as markers for dietary responses. A G/A polymorphism 75 bp upstream from the gene encoding apolipoprotein AI (APOA1) has been described in approximately 30% of the population. Our studies show that this polymorphism is associated with variability in the HDL-C response to dietary fat, specifically to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the diet. Carriers of the A allele respond to increases in dietary PUFA with elevations in HDL-C levels, probably due to altered interactions of transcription factors with the mutated promoter. Therefore carriers of the A allele can potentially decrease their atherogenic risk by consuming high-PUFA diets. Likewise, we have examined the interaction between other dietary habits, such as alcohol drinking, and variability at the APOE locus, and have demonstrated that the classical associations between APOE polymorphism and LDL-C levels are observed primarily in those subjects who consume alcohol. Moreover, we have found a subgroup of the population, APOE4 carriers, for whom drinking alcohol may exert detrimental effects on lipid metabolism. This knowledge will contribute towards the development of more effective personalized dietary recommendations.",Ordovas JM,Biochemical Society transactions,2002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12023827/,1,0,0,0,0,0
12020899,Mathematical modelling of schistosomiasis japonica: comparison of control strategies in the People's Republic of China.,"We present the first mathematical model on the transmission dynamics of Schistosoma japonicum. The work extends Barbour's classic model of schistosome transmission. It allows for the mammalian host heterogeneity characteristic of the S. japonicum life cycle, and solves the problem of under-specification of Barbour's model by the use of Chinese data we are collecting on human-bovine transmission in the Poyang Lake area of Jiangxi Province in China. The model predicts that in the lake/marshland areas of the Yangtze River basin: (1) once-yearly mass chemotherapy of humans is little better than twice-yearly mass chemotherapy in reducing human prevalence. Depending on the heterogeneity of prevalence within the population, targeted treatment of high prevalence groups, with lower overall coverage, can be more effective than mass treatment with higher overall coverage. Treatment confers a short term benefit only, with prevalence rising to endemic levels once chemotherapy programs are stopped; (2) depending on the relative contributions of bovines and humans, bovine treatment can benefit humans almost as much as human treatment. Like human treatment, bovine treatment confers a short-term benefit. A combination of human and bovine treatment will dramatically reduce human prevalence and maintains the reduction for a longer period of time than treatment of a single host, although human prevalence rises once treatment ceases; (3) assuming 75% coverage of bovines, a bovine vaccine which acts on worm fecundity must have about 75% efficacy to reduce the reproduction rate below one and ensure mid-term reduction and long-term elimination of the parasite. Such a vaccination program should be accompanied by an initial period of human treatment to instigate a short-term reduction in prevalence, following which the reduction is enhanced by vaccine effects; (4) if the bovine vaccine is only 45% efficacious (the level of current prototype vaccines) it will lower the endemic prevalence, but will not result in elimination. If it is accompanied by an initial period of human treatment and by a 45% improvement in human sanitation or a 30% reduction in contaminated water contact by humans, elimination is then possible.",Williams GM; Sleigh AC; Li Y; Feng Z; Davis GM; Chen H; Ross AG; Bergquist R; McManus DP,Acta tropica,2002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12020899/,1,0,0,0,0,0
11692301,Nutritional strategies to boost immunity and prevent infection in elderly individuals.,"Older adults are at risk for malnutrition, which may contribute to their increased risk of infection. Nutritional supplementation strategies can reduce this risk and reverse some of the immune dysfunction associated with advanced age. This review discusses nutritional interventions that have been examined in clinical trials of older adults. The data support use of a daily multivitamin or trace-mineral supplement that includes zinc (elemental zinc, >20 mg/day) and selenium (100 microg/day), with additional vitamin E, to achieve a daily dosage of 200 mg/day. Specific syndromes may also be addressed by nutritional interventions (for example, cranberry juice consumption to reduce urinary tract infections) and may reduce antibiotic use in older adults, particularly those living in long-term care facilities. Drug-nutrient interactions are common in elderly individuals, and care providers should be aware of these interactions. Future research should evaluate important clinical end points rather than merely surrogate markers of immunity.",High KP,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,2001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11692301/,1,0,0,0,0,0
11431575,"[Postprandial hyperlipidemia, small and dense LDL, HDL sub-fractions].","The association of postprandial hyperlipidemia, small and dense LDL particles and low HDL cholesterol levels is a major cardiovascular risk factor, highly prevalent in insulin resistant and diabetic patients. Several recent epidemiological studies have demonstrated that an abnormal increase in the postprandial triglyceride levels is an independent cardiovascular risk factor, independent from fasting triglyceride levels. A decreased clearance of postprandial triglycerides is related to an abnormal intravascular lipoprotein metabolism, most of the time secondary to an insulin resistant state and genetic factors. This abnormal lipoprotein metabolism also induces a redistribution of LDL particles towards small and dense particles and a decrease in the HDL cholesterol levels. Small, dense LDL are associated with a 3 fold increase in the risk of ischemic heart disease, but does not remain a significant risk factor after adjustment for triglyceride levels. Decreased HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I levels are strong cardiovascular risk factors, which does not seem to be better assessed with the assay of various HDL sub-fractions (HDL(2) et HDL(3), LpA-I et LpA-I: A-II.).",Braschi S,Annales de medecine interne,2001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11431575/,1,0,0,0,0,0
11360219,Nutrition in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy.,"Despite tremendous advances in treatment, persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection commonly experience a variety of nutritional problems, such as weight loss, fat redistribution, and obesity. We discuss basic dietary and metabolic problems as they pertain to persons with HIV infection and provide practical suggestions for their management. In all persons, changes in weight are caused by disruptions of energy balance, which can be disturbed by alterations in energy intake (effective ingestion of calories), energy expenditure (use of calories), or both. Factors that contribute to the disturbance of energy balance are discussed in the context of HIV infection. Management of weight loss and weight gain may then be directed at the affected components of energy balance. This information is intended to raise health care providers' attention to nutrition in their patients, including monitoring of weight, dietary issues, and relevant symptoms, and to encourage liaisons with experienced dietitians and exercise trainers.",Shevitz AH; Knox TA,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,2001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11360219/,1,0,0,0,0,0
11329609,Pharmacotherapy and growth factors in the treatment of short bowel syndrome.,"A review of the pharmacologic substances and growth factors that have been studied experimentally and administered clinically for the management of short bowel syndrome is presented. The medical management of short bowel syndrome is multifaceted. In the acute phase, efforts focus on fluid and electrolyte management and the reduction of gastric acid output. As enteral feeding is initiated, antimotility and antisecretory agents may be effective in reducing gastrointestinal losses. Additional modalities of management, including nutrients and growth factors, may be directed at maximizing absorptive function beyond that which occurs with intestinal adaptation. Continued research aimed at further elucidating the process of intestinal adaptation may allow us to use the various peptides and hormones that act as growth factors for the bowel mucosa. Knowledge gained from these studies combined with gene therapy techniques will result in the permanent enhancement of intestinal function beyond the normal adaptation process, eliminate the dependence on total parenteral nutrition, and avoid the need for intestine transplantation.",Schwartz MZ; Kuenzler KA,Seminars in pediatric surgery,2001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11329609/,1,0,0,0,0,0
11292639,Schistosomiasis in the People's Republic of China: prospects and challenges for the 21st century.,"Schistosomiasis japonica is a serious communicable disease and a major disease risk for more than 30 million people living in the tropical and subtropical zones of China. Infection remains a major public health concern despite 45 years of intensive control efforts. It is estimated that 865,000 people and 100,250 bovines are today infected in the provinces where the disease is endemic, and its transmission continues. Unlike the other schistosome species known to infect humans, the oriental schistosome, Schistosoma japonicum, is a true zoonotic organism, with a range of mammalian reservoirs, making control efforts extremely difficult. Clinical features of schistosomiasis range from fever, headache, and lethargy to severe fibro-obstructive pathology leading to portal hypertension, ascites, and hepatosplenomegaly, which can cause premature death. Infected children are stunted and have cognitive defects impairing memory and learning ability. Current control programs are heavily based on community chemotherapy with a single dose of the drug praziquantel, but vaccines (for use in bovines and humans) in combination with other control strategies are needed to make elimination of the disease possible. In this article, we provide an overview of the biology, epidemiology, clinical features, and prospects for control of oriental schistosomiasis in the People's Republic of China.",Ross AG; Sleigh AC; Li Y; Davis GM; Williams GM; Jiang Z; Feng Z; McManus DP,Clinical microbiology reviews,2001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11292639/,1,0,0,0,0,0
11224652,Hyperlipidemia and inhibitors of HIV protease.,"HIV protease inhibitors have been successfully incorporated into therapy for patients with HIV. These otherwise efficacious treatments present with multiple metabolic side-effects and body habitus changes known as the lipodystrophy syndrome. Direct associations of the lipid abnormalities with protease inhibitor use have been described, and ongoing studies are focused on describing mechanisms for future intervention. Mechanisms based on the molecular identity of the protease inhibitor target with human proteins, interference with aspects critical to lipoprotein production, and interference with adipocyte differentiation have been described.

11084396,[Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical function during and after steroid therapy: recent data and critical review].,"Prolonged corticosteroid treatment is considered to be the main cause of adrenal insufficiency (AI). AI is due to adrenal atrophy caused by the inhibition of ACTH secretion. Risk factors for AI after corticosteroid treatment remain unknown. Various functional tests, particularly the ""standard"" Synacthene 250 microg, demonstrate frequent abnormal responses in these patients. However, these abnormalities are not predictive of the risk of AI in particular in case of stress. More recent tests (CRH, ""low dose"" Synacthene) need to be further evaluated in this situation. Several recent studies in animals and in humans have demonstrated that the need for glucocorticoid coverage during a surgical stress has been greatly overestimated and that maintenance of the usual daily dose seems to be sufficient and safe in most patients with minor surgical stress. Revision of guidelines for more important surgical stress or for other medical conditions in patient treated with glucocorticoids is necessary.",Goichot B; Wicky C; Grunenberger F; Schlienger JL,Annales d'endocrinologie,2000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11084396/,1,0,0,0,0,0
10944494,Vitamin A supplementation: implications for morbidity and mortality in children.,"Vitamin A deficiency impairs epithelial integrity and systemic immunity and increases the incidence and severity of infections during childhood. However, findings from vitamin A supplementation trials are not consistent. Supplementation has resulted in significant reductions in mortality in several (but not all) large community-based trials among apparently healthy children. In hospital-based studies, vitamin A supplements have been consistently found to reduce the severity of measles infection, but no effect on nonmeasles respiratory infections has been observed. In some cases, the supplements were associated with an apparently increased risk of lower respiratory infection. Vitamin A supplements also reduced the severity of diarrhea in most (but not all) trials. Potential explanations for the differences in efficacy across trials are reviewed. While vitamin A supplementation is effective in reducing total mortality and complications from measles infections, it is likely to be more effective in populations suffering from nutritional deficiencies.",Villamor E; Fawzi WW,The Journal of infectious diseases,2000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10944494/,1,0,0,0,0,0
10919925,Inflammation and Native American medicine: the role of botanicals.,"There is a growing interest in medicinal botanicals as part of complementary medicine in the United States. In particular, both physicians and consumers are becoming aware of the use of herbals by Native American societies; many botanicals sold today as dietary supplements in the United States were used by Native Americans for similar purposes. Yet, these supplements represent only a small number of the >2500 different plant species from vascular taxa, and >2800 species from all taxa, known to have been prized for their medicinal properties by the indigenous inhabitants of the North American continent. We review some of the studies of the immunomodulatory activities of botanicals used by native peoples of North America, the bioactive constituents responsible for those activities, and the mechanisms by which these constituents might modulate the immune system. We focus particularly on 3 species of purple coneflower (ECHINACEA:) because of the widespread use of purple coneflower in the United States to boost immunity and prevent upper respiratory infections. Seven of the 10 most common botanicals sold in the United States were used extensively by Native Americans. However, there are very few data to support such use and even less information about drug toxicity or interactions.",Borchers AT; Keen CL; Stern JS; Gershwin ME,The American journal of clinical nutrition,2000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10919925/,1,0,0,0,0,0
10901194,Human requirement for N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.,"The diet of our ancestors was less dense in calories, being higher in fiber, rich in fruits, vegetables, lean meat, and fish. As a result, the diet was lower in total fat and saturated fat, but contained equal amounts of n-6 and n-3 essential fatty acids. Linoleic acid (LA) is the major n-6 fatty acid, and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is the major n-3 fatty acid. In the body, LA is metabolized to arachidonic acid (AA), and ALA is metabolized to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The ratio of n-6 to n-3 essential fatty acids was 1 to 2:1 with higher levels of the longer-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), such as EPA, DHA, and AA, than today's diet. Today this ratio is about 10 to 1:20 to 25 to 1, indicating that Western diets are deficient in n-3 fatty acids compared with the diet on which humans evolved and their genetic patterns were established. The n-3 and n-6 EPA are not interconvertible in the human body and are important components of practically all cell membranes. The N-6 and n-3 fatty acids influence eicosanoid metabolism, gene expression, and intercellular cell-to-cell communication. The PUFA composition of cell membranes is, to a great extent, dependent on dietary intake. Therefore, appropriate amounts of dietary n-6 and n-3 fatty acids need to be considered in making dietary recommendations. These two classes of PUFA should be distinguished because they are metabolically and functionally distinct and have opposing physiological functions; their balance is important for homeostasis and normal development. Studies with nonhuman primates and human newborns indicate that DHA is essential for the normal functional development of the retina and brain, particularly in premature infants. A balanced n-6/n-3 ratio in the diet is essential for normal growth and development and should lead to decreases in cardiovascular disease and other chronic diseases and improve mental health. Although a recommended dietary allowance for essential fatty acids does not exist, an adequate intake (AI) has been estimated for n-6 and n-3 essential fatty acids by an international scientific working group. For Western societies, it will be necessary to decrease the intake of n-6 fatty acids and increase the intake of n-3 fatty acids. The food industry is already taking steps to return n-3 essential fatty acids to the food supply by enriching various foods with n-3 fatty acids. To obtain the recommended AI, it will be necessary to consider the issues involved in enriching the food supply with n-3 PUFA in terms of dosage, safety, and sources of n-3 fatty acids.",Simopoulos AP,Poultry science,2000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10901194/,1,0,0,0,0,0
10882341,Stable isotope turnover of apolipoproteins of high-density lipoproteins in humans.,"Amino acid precursors labelled with stable isotopes have been successfully used to explore the metabolism of the apolipoproteins of HDL. Some methodological and mathematical modelling problems remain, mainly related to amino acid recycling in a plasma protein such as apolipoprotein A-I with a long residence time (the reciprocal of the fractional catabolic rate) of 4-5 days. Apolipoprotein A-I, apolipoprotein E, and apolipoprotein A-IV in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (containing chylomicrons, VLDL, and remnants) exhibit more complex kinetics. The small amounts of apolipoprotein A-I and of apolipoprotein A-IV in the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins have a residence time similar to that of the apolipoprotein A-I of HDL. In contrast, the apolipoprotein E in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins has been found to have an average residence time of 0.11 days. Diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol, which lower HDL levels, do so by decreasing the secretion of apolipoprotein A-I, with apolipoprotein A-II kinetics unaffected. Individuals with impaired glucose tolerance have a decreased residence time of apolipoprotein A-I but no change in secretion rate or in apolipoprotein A-II kinetics. This suggests a link between insulin resistance and the risk of atherosclerosis. In heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, both the fractional catabolic rate and the secretion rate of apolipoprotein A-I are increased, resulting in no change in the plasma level. Stable isotope studies have strengthened the evidence that triglyceride enrichment of HDL increases its catabolism Laboratory.",Marsh JB; Welty FK; Schaefer EJ,Current opinion in lipidology,2000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10882341/,1,0,0,0,0,0
10719119,A vaccine against Asian schistosomiasis: the story unfolds.,"The development of an effective vaccine against the Asian schistosome is at a critical stage. Despite the fact that progress has been relatively slow, the successful use in animals of attenuated vaccines combined with recent encouraging results using defined native and recombinantly derived Schistosoma japonicum antigens, suggests that development of a safe and effective vaccine is feasible. This review examines current progress aimed at achieving this objective, and a summary is provided of recent results obtained with the most encouraging vaccine antigens. When available for wide-scale use, it is envisaged that the vaccine would be applied in the first instance, at least in China, in the veterinary context (to impact on human transmission) and then, perhaps, if required, clinically (to prevent or reduce disease). The search for the final product is likely to be demanding, and funding issues pertaining to Good Manufacturing Practice-scale-up of the vaccine for the required extensive veterinary coverage, and to support any future human trials, will need to be resolved. As such, we may still have to wait some time before the ultimate vaccine, possibly comprising a cocktail of several molecules, is available. Even then, the vaccine would probably be used optimally as one component of an integrated programme of schistosomiasis control that would include effective and well-tested approaches, such as health education and targeted chemotherapy.",McManus DP,International journal for parasitology,2000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10719119/,1,0,0,0,0,0
10702385,Bacterial resistance to aminoglycosides and beta-lactams: the Tn1331 transposon paradigm.,"Aminoglycosides (Ags) are a group of antibiotics that exert their bactericidal activity primarily by inhibition of protein synthesis. Aminoglycoside (Ag) molecules bind to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit rendering the ribosomes unavailable for translation, which results in cell death. Although these antibiotics are and have been very useful to treat a variety of bacterial infections, in recent years the number of Ag resistant and multiresistant isolates has seriously increased. Mechanisms of resistance to Ag include enzymatic inactivation by acetyltransferases, nucleotidyltransferases (adenylyltransferases), and phosphotransferases, ribosomal alterations, and reduced permeability. Of all Ags, amikacin (Ak) is the most resistant to the action of Ag-modifying enzymes. However, AAC(6')-I type enzymes (a group of 6'-N-acetyltransferases) can utilize Ak as substrate and confer resistance to this antibiotic in addition to other Ags. The gene aac(6')-Ib was found in various bacterial species and various research groups performed mutagenesis studies on this or related enzymes. In one case, aac(6')-Ib was identified in a transposable element, Tn1331, included in pJHCMW1, a plasmid isolated from a clinical K. pneumoniae strain. Tn1331 includes genes encoding two Ag-modifying enzymes (aac(6')-Ib and ant(3"")-Ia) and two beta-lactamases (blaTEM and blaOXA-9). Characterization of other functions of the pJHCMW1 plasmid showed the presence of an RNA-regulated replication origin and a functional oriT. Stability by multimer resolution is achieved by the Tn1331 resolvase.",Tolmasky ME,Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library,2000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10702385/,1,0,0,0,0,0
