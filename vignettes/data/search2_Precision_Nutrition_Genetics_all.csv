41539835,Edible mRNA platforms: The next frontier in precision functional foods.,"The tendency toward functional foods is moving not toward the fixed intake of nutrient supplementation but toward dynamic biological regulation. Nanocarriers of edible mRNA are disruptive technologies, whereby foods may serve as bioreactors to induce temporary, targeted delivery of genes without posing the threat of genomic integration. The review is the summation of 156 peer-reviewed papers (2022--2025) and industrial reports to evaluate the bases of the technology, translational prospects, and social implications of edible mRNA systems in functional foods. It is used in the fields of immunomodulation, metabolism regulation, scalable production and ethical nutrition. mRNA delivery structures, including plant lipid droplets and chitosan-alginate structures, facilitate oral stability and intestinal control. IL-10 mRNA has been used in the management of IBD, whereas FGF21 mRNA has been used to treat obesity, and milk exosome-based immune priming has been used. Although there are challenges such as mRNA degradation during processing and uncertain regulatory mechanisms, edible mRNA systems have benefits over traditional nutritional supplements, such as shorter developmental cycles and low costs. The given review offers a roadmap with the help of which it is possible to combine green synthesis, the principles of a circular economy, and AI-based personalization, which allows making mRNA foods potentially scalable answers to sustainable precision nutrition.",Liu Y; Wang L; Jin W; Pei J; Abd El-Aty AM,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41539835/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41539810,Microbial succession-potential influence mechanism on flavor modulation in spontaneously fermented Moringa oleifera leaves: An integrative multi-omics approach.,"In this study, the relationship between flavor composition and microbial succession in Moringa oleifera pickles (MOPs) at different stages of spontaneous fermentation was systematically investigated. The results demonstrated a significant increase in the content of organic acids and amino acids during fermentation including malonic acid, citric acid, valine (Val), and asparagine (Asn). These compounds not only enhanced the overall flavor profile but also provided favorable nutritional conditions that supported microbial succession. Furthermore, an integrated aroma network was established through the combined application of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS). GC-MS identified key aroma-active compounds such as ethyl caproate (fruity note), 3-hexenal (green, grassy note), and 2-phenylethanol (floral, rosy note). Complementarily, GC-IMS confirmed that esters, alcohols, and terpenes were the major contributors to fruit-like, mushroom-like, and fresh herbal aromas, indicating their critical role as flavor-modulating compounds throughout fermentation. Metagenomic analysis revealed Corynebacterium, Escherichia, Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas, and Pantoea as the dominant microbial genera involved in fermentation. These microbes primarily participated in amino acid, carbohydrate, and nucleotide metabolism and exhibited a close association with the formation of key flavor compounds. The strong influence of microbial succession on flavor evolution is likely driven by the observed correlations between microbial taxa and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These correlations may stem from a series of complex ecological and metabolic interactions, including substrate competition, niche adaptation, and upstream-downstream dependencies within microbial metabolic networks. This study provides a theoretical foundation for the quality control of MOPs and the mitigation of potential pathogenic microorganisms, thereby supporting its application in enhancing product quality and consumer sensory satisfaction in the pickle industry.",Liu Y; Guo Y; Mu H; Aaqil M; Zhang F; Zheng J; Sheng J; Tian Y; Zhao C,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41539810/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41515222,Influence of APOE4 Genotypes on Nutrient-Cognition Relationship in Taiwanese Older Adults: Longitudinal Findings from the HALST.,"<b>Background</b>: Older adults carrying the APOE4 allele are at elevated risk for cognitive decline. To clarify how dietary patterns may influence cognitive deterioration in this high-risk group, further investigation is needed. <b>Methods</b>: This prospective cohort study followed 1420 Taiwanese adults aged 65 years or older. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire, and cognitive function was measured with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Changes in 31 nutrients between two survey waves were used to simulate the effect of dietary shifts, and dietary patterns were derived using principal component analysis (PCA) with oblimin-derived scores. The analysis was further stratified by APOE genotype, and multiple linear regression models adjusted for demographic and health-related factors were applied to evaluate the associations between dietary changes and cognitive function. <b>Results</b>: Positive associations between dietary change and MMSE scores were observed only among APOE4 carriers. In this group, lower adherence to a plant-based pattern (TC1, estimate = 0.115, 95% CI = 0.029, 0.201) and higher adherence to an animal- and fat-rich pattern (TC2, estimate = -0.119, 95% CI = -0.202, -0.035) were both associated with poorer cognitive performance. <b>Conclusions</b>: APOE4 carriers may be particularly sensitive to dietary patterns, suggesting that genotype-informed nutritional strategies could help preserve cognitive health in older adults.",Lai RH; Yang SJ; Hsu PY; Chen YC; Chuang SC; Hsu CC; Hsiung CA; Kuo FL,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41515222/,0,0,0,0,0,1
41515177,Thyroid-Microbiome Allostasis and Mitochondrial Performance: An Integrative Perspective in Exercise Physiology.,"Exercise acts as a physiological stimulus, requiring precise coordination among endocrine, microbial, and mitochondrial systems to maintain metabolic stability through allostatic regulation. The goal of the article is to integrate multidisciplinary evidence to characterize the thyroid-microbiome-mitochondrial axis as a key regulator of the allostatic state in athletic physiological response. During acute, chronic, and overload training phases, the thyroid-microbiome-mitochondrial axis operates bidirectionally, coupling microbial signaling with endocrine and mitochondrial networks to mediate metabolic response to exercise. This response shows interindividual variability driven by sex, age, genetics, and nutritional status, shaping the boundaries between adaptive efficiency and allostatic overload. Microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and secondary bile acids, modulate deiodinase activity, bile acid recycling, and mitochondrial biogenesis through AMPK-SIRT1-PGC1α signaling, optimizing substrate use and thermogenic capacity. Thyroid hormones reciprocally regulate gut motility, luminal pH, and bile secretion, maintaining microbial diversity and mineral absorption. Under excessive training load, caloric restriction, or inadequate recovery, this network becomes transiently unbalanced: SCFA synthesis decreases, D3 activity increases, and a reversible low-T<sub>3</sub>/high-rT<sub>3</sub> pattern emerges, resembling early Hashimoto- or Graves-like responses. Selenium-, zinc-, and iron-dependent enzymes form the redox link between microbial metabolism, thyroid control, and mitochondrial defense. In conclusion, the thyroid-microbiome-mitochondrial axis provides the physiological basis for the allostatic state, a reversible phase of dynamic recalibration that integrates training, nutrition, environmental stress, and circadian cues to sustain thyroid activity, mitochondrial efficiency, and microbial balance. This integrative perspective supports precision interventions to optimize recovery and performance in athletes.",Odriozola A; González A; Odriozola I; Corbi F; Álvarez-Herms J,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41515177/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41475244,The study of functional properties of kiwifruit peel dietary fiber and the bioactivity as well as synergetic prebiotic effects of bound phenolics in it during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion and colonic fermentation.,"The structure, functional performance of soluble and insoluble Kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis Planch) peel dietary fiber (KPDF) as well as abundant bound phenolics (BPs) in them were systematically investigated. It turned out that KPDF conserved outstanding capacities in adsorption and cation exchange. 23 BPs were identified in KPDF, most of which were inaccessible during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion but up to 27.10 % and 57.89 % BPs were released form insoluble and soluble KPDF after 24 h and 12 h colonic fermentation, respectively. Meanwhile, KPDF promoted the reproduction of beneficial bacteria such as Prevotella, Dialister, Faecalibacterium, while reducing the abundances of harmful bacteria such as Collinsella, Dorea, and Gemmiger with BPs contributing to such features. Such results reflected the promoting effects of BPs in the prebiotic effects of functional KPDF, providing theoretical foundation for the further exploration of KPDF as functional nutritional factors in health promotion.",Hou C; Yu J; Ji M; Chen Y; Liu C; Zhang W; Yu H; Xu C; Zhou X; Sun L; Liu X; Wang Y,Food chemistry,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41475244/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41461264,Food as Medicine: Enhancing Crop Breeding and Food Processing to Shift the Gut Microbiome for Prevention and Treatment of Chronic Diseases.,"Prebiotics are useful tools for shifting the gut microbiome and metabolome to confer immune, metabolic, and preventive benefits for human disease. However, there are emerging concerns about methods for discovering optimal candidate compounds and their sustainable production for long-term success in targeting mechanisms of disease. In this perspective, we review the current state of prebiotics moving from nutrition to function in health, highlighting the opportunities for using food as medicine in treating a model disease, inflammatory bowel disease, discussing the ways crop breeding can be used to identify and improve the functional (beyond nutritional) value of a prebiotic and the critical role that food processing plays in sustaining the integrity and scalability of the prebiotic compound while influencing consumer adoption of these agents. This information supports a trajectory for the future of food as medicine to be moving from population-scale dietary guidelines to personalized or precision nutrition guidelines, from ""eat more fiber"" to ""eat this specific type of fiber that has been enhanced in and processed from this specific genotype of food crop"". This could include developing designer fibers by crop breeding to develop panels of genotypes with different fiber structures that deliver reliable shifts in the microbiome and metabolome for most patients with the targeted disease. Finally, there needs to be a commitment to sustainability of the plant-derived product so that future generations will have access to the same benefits of the food as medicine initially developed for disease prevention and treatment.",Mannon PJ; Benson AK; Schnable JC; Ding W; Juritsch AF; Rose DJ,The Journal of nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41461264/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41429531,[Research progress on precise lifestyle intervention for obesity based on genetic background].,"With the advancement of genomic technologies, precision lifestyle interventions tailored to individual genetic backgrounds have emerged as a novel approach for preventing and managing chronic diseases such as obesity. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) targeting obese or overweight populations have found that individuals with different genotypes exhibit varying responses to the same lifestyle intervention (gene-lifestyle intervention interactions). To date, more than 20 genes, including <i>FTO</i> and <i>MC4R</i>, have been identified to show such interactions, suggesting that genotype-based precision nutrition is a feasible approach. Based on this, some RCTs have compared the effectiveness of genotype-based precision interventions and one-fits-all interventions. However, current study results show considerable heterogeneity, and it remains inconclusive whether precision interventions are superior to one-fits-all interventions. Future studies should further explore precision intervention strategies, particularly by taking polygenic effects into account and integrating multi-omics data using methods such as machine learning, to provide new insights for precision interventions.",Li YX; Peng HX; Guo HD; Hou TJ; Zhang HY; Zheng Y; Tan YX; Zhang HD; Wu YQ; Qin XY; Wu T; Chen DF; Hu YH; Wang MY,Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41429531/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41422458,High intestinal iron absorption induced by decreased hepcidin leads to imbalance of iron metabolism in aging mice.,"Iron homeostasis which is primarily regulated through intestinal iron absorption, is usually disrupted in the elderly. But changes of intestinal iron absorption with aging have not been elucidated. This study aims to investigate the role of intestinal iron absorption in driving age-related disruption of iron homeostasis. Male C57BL/6 J mice aged 2, 12, 18, and 24 months were utilized in this study to analyze age-related changes in systemic iron status, detect the alterations in intestinal iron absorption via Ussing Chamber, and clarify its regulatory mechanisms during aging via western blot and RT-qPCR. Results showed that iron deposition occurred in the liver, heart, brain, spleen, and kidney with age. Furthermore, intestinal iron absorption elevated in aged mice, particularly in the duodenum, which was accompanied by upregulated DMT1 and FPN. As FPN is the only known iron exporter in enterocytes, the upregulation of FPN was considered as the key factor of higher iron absorption during aging. Then factors influencing FPN expression were determined. It was found that serum hepcidin and hepatic Hamp mRNA levels significantly decreased. And a reduction of over 40% in p-SMAD1/5/8 which is a transcriptional regulator of hepcidin was observed. Overall, these findings suggested that the downregulation of p-SMAD is a key factor limiting the transcription of hepcidin during aging, then increased the expression of intestinal FPN, further resulting in increased iron absorption and iron homeostasis imbalance. This study demonstrated that dysregulation of the hepcidin production during aging is a key driver of iron homeostasis disruption in the elderly, representing a target for precision intervention.",Qiu L; Xiong W; Qin X; Zhou J; Zhu Y; Wang X,Biogerontology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41422458/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41374081,Linking Personality Traits to Mediterranean Diet Adherence and Exploring Gene-Diet Interactions in Neuroticism.,"There is adherence to a healthy Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), but adherence varies widely. Precision nutrition is increasingly interested in individual characteristics influencing diet adherence, but few studies have examined personality traits. Our main aim was to investigate the association between personality traits and MedDiet adherence. Our secondary aims were to explore genome-wide genetic variants associated with neuroticism, including replication of previous findings, as well as to explore gene-MedDiet interactions. We analyzed participants (aged 55-75) in the PREDIMED-Plus-Valencia study and measured clinical, lifestyle, and genetic factors. The Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised (EPQ-R) was used to measure neuroticism, psychoticism, and extraversion. Genotyping was undertaken, and associations with candidate SNPs, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), genetic risk scores (GRS), and gene-MedDiet interactions were explored. Neuroticism was inversely (beta = -0.09; <i>p</i> = 0.001) associated with adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MEDAS-17). Likewise, the probability of low MedDiet adherence increased neuroticism (OR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.02-1.60; <i>p</i> = 0.031 per SD). In the GWAS for this trait, several SNPs surpassed the suggestive level of statistical significance. The most strongly associated was rs10181407-<i>NDUFA10</i> (NADH dehydrogenase 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 10) (beta = -2.39; <i>p</i> = 2.70 × 10<sup>-6</sup>). The GRS for neuroticism was significantly associated with MedDiet adherence (beta = -0.18; <i>p</i> = 0.020), increasing the causality level. We replicated some candidate SNPs, and among them, the rs2243873-<i>EHMT2</i> (euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferase 2) gene. The analysis of gene-MedDiet interactions revealed the role of these dietary modulations. Neuroticism was the personality trait most inversely associated with MedDiet adherence, suggesting its integration in precision nutrition analysis. Moreover, neuroticism-related genetics and MedDiet modulations will also be important.",Sorlí JV; Ortega-Azorín C; Coltell O; Fernández-Carrión R; Asensio EM; Portolés O; Perez-Fidalgo A; Ramirez-Sabio JB; Guillem-Saiz J; Costa JA; Gimenez-Alba IM; Barragán R; Ordovas JM; Corella D,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41374081/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41367416,Regulatory mechanisms of the gut microbiota-short chain fatty acids signaling axis in slow transit constipation and progress in multi-target interventions.,"Slow-transit constipation (STC) is an increasingly prevalent disorder that imposes a substantial health and economic burden. Mounting evidence highlights the ""gut microbiota-short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-motility"" axis as a central pathophysiological link between dysbiosis and impaired colonic transit. This review synthesizes current knowledge of how SCFAs, especially acetate, propionate and butyrate, shape motility through serotonergic signaling, enteric nervous system modulation, epithelial barrier integrity and immune regulation. Particular attention is devoted to the biased-signaling properties of the SCFA receptors FFAR2 and FFAR3 (free fatty acid receptors 2 and 3, respectively), including emerging data on their heterodimerization. The article then appraises recent randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses of multi-target interventions (dietary fibers, synbiotics, postbiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, phytochemicals, and small-molecule FFAR agonists) highlighting their efficacy, safety, and translational hurdles. Finally, the authors propose a precision-medicine framework that integrates multi-omics microbiome profiling, metabolomics, and host genetics to enable phenotype-stratified therapy. Key research gaps include limited long-term safety data, heterogeneous human cohorts and the need for large multicenter trials and machine-learning-guided responder prediction. Collectively, the review provides a roadmap for shifting STC management from symptom control to mechanism-based, personalized care.",Liu SH; Yang XF; Liang L; Song BB; Song XM; Yang YJ; Alhoot MA,Frontiers in microbiology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41367416/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41365911,Microbiome-dependent functional responses to structurally distinct oligosaccharides revealed by metaproteomics.,"Dietary oligosaccharides are prebiotics that fuel gut microbes, but individual microbiomes may respond differently depending on oligosaccharide structures as well as microbiome composition and function. The extent to which specific gut microbial communities exhibit personalized functional responses to distinct oligosaccharides remains underexplored. We applied a standardized ex vivo microbiome culture, called RapidAIM, coupled with metaproteomics to examine how six structurally diverse oligosaccharides affect the gut microbiota functional response. Our study shows that while human gut microbiomes share some commonalities in utilizing oligosaccharides (e.g. prioritizing dietary fibers over mucin), the fine-scale metabolic and taxonomic responses are highly individualized. Such findings underscore the importance of considering personal microbiome profiles when predicting the outcome of prebiotic interventions. In a broader context, our metaproteomic approach provides a framework for identifying optimal prebiotic choices tailored to individual microbiomes. Ultimately, understanding these personalized responses could inform precision nutrition strategies.",Zhang A; Wu Q; Mayne J; Ning Z; Qin H; Dewar A; Figeys D,NPJ biofilms and microbiomes,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41365911/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41354681,Tissue-resident microbiota impacts colorectal cancer progression and prognosis.,"To deepen the understanding of tissue-resident microbiota in colorectal cancer (CRC), we analyzed whole-genome and transcriptome data from 937 patients. We identified 249 genera and 361 species commonly present in both tumors and adjacent normal tissues (NATs). Distinct microbial signatures were associated with anatomical location, tumor stages, hypermutation status, mutations in CRC driver and DNA damage repair genes, as well as consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs). Notably, the presence of the pks island and elevated abundance of Enterobacteriaceae were linked to poor prognosis specifically in CMS2 tumors. Finally, microbial risk scores derived from taxa present in tumor or NATs predicted patient prognosis independently of established clinico-molecular factors. Prognostic taxa were strongly associated with tumor transcriptomic pathways related to hypoxia, immune response, and metabolic status. These findings revealed the heterogeneity of tissue-resident microbiota and their critical role in CRC progression, highlighting potential avenues for targeted intervention.",Shi Z; Ren H; Lin C; Li F; Wu M; Yang F; Luo T; Nunes L; Isaksson A; Hammarström K; Zhu T; Zhu S; Zhong Y; Ljuslinder I; Uhlén M; Palmqvist R; Glimelius B; Wu K; Sjöblom T; Zhong H,Nature communications,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41354681/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41352811,Low-cholesterol egg yolk lipids alleviated the development of atherosclerosis in ApoE <sup>-/-</sup> mice by regulating bile acid metabolism and gut microbiota.,"Atherosclerosis (AS), a major cardiovascular disease driver, can be caused by high levels of serum cholesterol. Eggs are the main source for dietary cholesterol, and although epidemiological studies reported no association between egg intakes and cardiovascular diseases, dietary cholesterol intake is still restricted for individuals with dyslipidemia. This study evaluated the effects of egg yolk lipids isolated from low-cholesterol (LC) and normal eggs (NC) on the progression of AS using the ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice at doses corresponding to one (L) or two (H) eggs daily in human. After the 8-weeks' intervention with LC, the aortic plaque areas were significantly reduced, along with the alleviation of oxidative stress by elevating aortic SOD activity. Serum contents of TC and LDL-C were significantly decreased in LC-H group, as well as the pro-inflammatory TNF-α, IL-1β and relative expression of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1). Lipidomics revealed that PE contents in LC significantly increased while PC decreased compared with NC, leading to the increases in serum contents of DHA-rich PE. LC intervention inhibited hepatic cholesterol synthesis by upregulating LDLR and CYP7A1, enhanced LDL-C clearance and conversion to bile acids, with a significantly increase in UDCA and TUDCA while decrease in LCA and DCA. These bioactivities of LC were related to the enrichment of Lactobacillus and Akkermansia and decrease of Rikenella and Faecalimonas. Our studies first give direct evidence for evaluating the health effects of eggs, especially eggs with reduced contents of cholesterol, which laid a theoretical foundation for defining the target populations of low-cholesterol eggs.",Cheng L; Zhang M; Wu F; Dong J; Wang Y; Dong L; Ma Y; Zheng C; Wang Z; Li Y; Wang R; Ren F; Fang B,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41352811/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41327482,Butyrate-producing commensal bacteria confers colon immune defense function via enhancing H4K31 Crotonylation of macrophages.,"The mechanisms by which microbiota from disease-resistant populations or animals improve intestinal immune defense remain incompletely elucidated. Tibetan pig, a renowned disease-resistant breed, serve as a valuable research subject for the health of humans and economic animals. In this study, fecal microbiota transplantation from Tibetan piglets into mice conferred enhanced resistance to C. rodentium DBS100. Further microbiota profiling and metabolomics analysis showed this protection may be partly ascribed to C. butyricum SLZX19-05 in recipients' colon. Administration of C. butyricum SLZX19-05 to germ-free mice resulted in the significantly increased lysozyme expression within colonic macrophages, subsequently bolstering the resistance to C. rodentium infection. In mice and piglets, this C. butyricum similarly elevated the lysozyme level in colon and decreased diarrhea incidence. Conversely, lyz1-knockout heightened mice's susceptibility to C. rodentium, highlighting lysozyme's critical role in immune defense. Mechanistically, this study systematically revealed that C. butyricum enhanced lysozyme expression by inhibiting mTORC1-HDAC3/8 pathway, leading to the increased H4K31 Crotonylation (H4K31Cr) and openness of an upstream region of lyz1 promoter via butyrate in macrophages. Additionally, H4K31-mutant mice showed the leukopenia, further validating the significance of H4K31Cr in immune regulation. Collectively, mTORC1-HDAC3/8-H4K31Cr pathway is a key mechanism by which butyrate-producing commensal bacteria enhance immune defense in gut. This discovery provides a novel foundation for the screening and application of the next generation of butyrate-producing probiotics.

41326679,A plasmid-borne gadRCB operon contributes to acid tolerance in Lactiplantibacillus plantarum ZR79.,"The glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) system catalyzed the conversion of L-glutamate to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in a proton-consuming reaction, which played a critical role to maintain intracellular pH homeostasis. However, the genetic organization and functional roles of GAD system in Lactiplantibacillus plantarum remain incompletely understood. In this study, L. plantarum ZR79, a GABA-producing strain, was successfully screened from 120 L. plantarum strains based on gas production and pH increase after 48-h fermentation. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that only L. plantarum ZR79 harbors two glutamate decarboxylases encoded by gadA and gadB, respectively. Insertional inactivation of the gadB gene abolished the ability to synthesize GABA, suggesting that the gadB gene plays a critical role in GABA biosynthesis in L. plantarum ZR79. The complete genome sequencing analysis combined with RT-PCR revealed that the gadB gene was located on the plasmid pZR79, which was co-transcribed with gadR and gadC. Plasmid stability assays revealed that pZR79 was stably maintained in ZR79 over 200 generations. Furthermore, acid stress survival assays confirmed that gadB-mediated GABA production contributes to the acid tolerance of L. plantarum ZR79. This study provides the first evidence of a plasmid-encoded gadRCB operon in L. plantarum, offering new insights into the strain-specific genetic basis of GABA biosynthesis and its physiological role in acid stress resistance. KEY POINTS: • L. plantarum ZR79 harbors two distinct glutamate decarboxylase-encoding genes, gadA and gadB, with the gadB gene cluster located on its plasmid pZR79. • Insertional inactivation of the gadB gene abolished the ability of L. plantarum ZR79 to synthesize GABA. • The gadB gene increased the survival ability in L. plantarum ZR79 under acidic conditions.",Fan C; Cao Z; Liu X; Hao Y; Zhai Z; Hao Y,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41326679/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41306022,Molecular Insights into the Functional Roles of Variants in the <italic>FADS</italic> Gene Cluster on Omega-3 Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Synthesis.,"Omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3-LCPUFAs) have strong triglyceride-lowering and anti-inflammatory properties, and high levels of these fatty acids have been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. The synthesis of n3-LCPUFA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and n6-LCPUFA, arachidonic acid, share a common pathway mediated by fatty acid desaturase genes, FADS1 and FADS2. LCPUFA synthesis is regulated by both modifiable and non-modifiable factors. Of particular interest is the role of genetic variants in the FADS gene cluster, which are associated with altered FADS1 and FADS2 expression, as well as LCPUFA levels. However, the specific functional variants and the precise molecular mechanisms by which these variants regulate FADS gene expression remain to be elucidated. Variation in the FADS gene cluster is thought to have arisen through natural selection and changing dietary patterns. Available evidence suggests these variants, either individually or as a haplotype, may alter FADS gene expression by modifying DNA methylation in regulatory regions, as well as microRNA and transcription factor binding sites. This review explores the current state of knowledge regarding the functional roles of these variants on LCPUFA synthesis and how these new insights will help support precision nutrition strategies aimed at improving an individual's n3-LCPUFA status and health. Identifying specific functional variants in or near the FADS gene cluster and elucidating the mechanisms by which these variants impact LCPUFA synthesis requires further investigation. However, hypothesis generating in vitro studies have revealed roles for epigenetics, non-coding RNAs, and modification of transcription factor binding sites. This knowledge will generate new insights that will help improve our understanding of the genetic basis underlying LCPUFA synthesis and how this may differ across populations.",Coulson M; Mutch DM,Lifestyle genomics,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41306022/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41305652,Hidden Hunger in Pediatric Obesity: Redefining Malnutrition Through Macronutrient Quality and Micronutrient Deficiency.,"<b>Background:</b> Pediatric obesity exemplifies the paradox of energy excess coexisting with nutritional inadequacy. Despite high caloric intake, children with obesity often display deficiencies in essential macro- and micronutrients that impair growth, metabolic regulation, and long-term health. This review critically examines the mechanisms underlying malnutrition in pediatric obesity, emphasizing the interplay between dietary quality, inflammation, microbiota alterations, and biomarker profiles, and identifies research gaps limiting precision nutrition approaches. <b>Methods:</b> A comprehensive narrative review of studies addressing macro- and micronutrient intake, metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers, and gut microbiota-host interactions in pediatric obesity was conducted. Evidence from both clinical and experimental models was integrated to evaluate mechanistic pathways, diagnostic criteria, and preventive strategies. <b>Results:</b> Obesity-related malnutrition arises from poor dietary quality, systemic inflammation, and microbiota dysbiosis, leading to impaired nutrient utilization and metabolic dysfunction. Deficiencies in vitamin D, calcium, iron, magnesium, and B vitamins are common and often coexist with macronutrient imbalances. Diets rich in saturated fats and refined carbohydrates exacerbate inflammation and metabolic risk, whereas plant-based proteins, unsaturated fats, and fiber support metabolic resilience. Precision nutrition and biomarker-guided monitoring show promise but require validation in pediatric cohorts. Evidence on microbiota modulation and nutrient-gene interactions remains inconsistent, reflecting methodological heterogeneity. <b>Conclusions:</b> Malnutrition in pediatric obesity should be recognized as a distinct clinical phenotype characterized by qualitative nutrient deficiency within a state of energy surplus. Addressing this paradox demands harmonized diagnostic criteria, longitudinal biomarker surveillance, and individualized dietary strategies informed by genetics and microbiome profiling. Multilevel interventions, linking clinical practice, policy, and food system reform, are essential to prevent lifelong metabolic complications and promote healthy growth trajectories.",Dargenio VN; Sgarro N; La Grasta G; Begucci M; Castellaneta SP; Dargenio C; Paulucci L; Francavilla R; Cristofori F,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41305652/,1,0,0,0,0,1
41305606,<i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> Lp20 Alleviates High Fat Diet-Induced Obesity in Mice via Its Bile Salt Hydrolase Activity.,"<b>Background:</b> Obesity is a highly prevalent chronic disease characterized by excessive weight gain and fat accumulation. There is growing evidence that <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> strains with bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity are effective in preventing and alleviating obesity. <b>Methods:</b> Initially, we screened bacterial strains with high hydrolytic activity against glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GDCA), and constructed an isogenic bsh1 knockout mutant. Subsequently, male C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) were randomly assigned to receive daily gavage of either the wild-type Lp20 (Lp20-WT) or the bsh1-deficient mutant (Lp20-<i>Δbsh1</i>) for 8 weeks. Serum cholesterol levels and histopathological changes in liver sections were monitored. Hepatic gene expression was quantified by RT-qPCR, and fecal bacterial communities were analyzed via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. These comprehensive assessments aimed to evaluate metabolic improvements and uncover the potential mechanisms behind the observed effects. <b>Results:</b><i>L. plantarum</i> Lp20 hydrolyzed 91.62% of GDCA, exhibiting the highest bile-salt hydrolase (BSH) activity among tested isolates. Whole-genome sequencing and in-silico analyses mapped this activity to <i>bsh1</i>; gene deletion of <i>bsh1</i> confirmed the role of <i>bsh1</i> in GDCA hydrolysis. Daily gavage of the wild-type strain (Lp20-WT) to diet-induced obese mice markedly attenuated weight gain, reduced inguinal white adipose tissue and mesenteric fat mass, and lowered serum TC and LDL-C by 20.8% and 33.3%, respectively, while decreasing ALT and AST levels and reversing hepatic steatosis. In contrast, the bsh1-null mutant (Lp20-<i>Δbsh1</i>) failed to elicit any measurable metabolic benefit. Mechanistically, Lp20-WT upregulated rate-limiting bile-acid synthetic enzymes CYP7A1 and CYP27A1, thereby accelerating the catabolism of cholesterol into bile acids. Concurrently, it activated hepatic TGR5 and FXR signaling axes to modulate hepatic metabolism. Moreover, Lp20-WT restructured the gut microbiota by notably enhancing the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as <i>norank_f__Muribaculaceae</i>, <i>Akkermansia</i>, and <i>Alistipes</i>, while reducing the abundance of potentially harmful taxa, including <i>norank_f__Desulfovibrionaceae</i>, <i>Dubosiella</i>, and <i>Mucispirillum</i>. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study provides direct evidence of BSH's anti-obesity effects through gene deletion. Specifically, BSH lowers cholesterol by modulating hepatic bile-acid metabolism-related gene expression and altering the gut microbiota composition.

41302083,"Nutrigenomics of Obesity: Integrating Genomics, Epigenetics, and Diet-Microbiome Interactions for Precision Nutrition.","Obesity is a highly complex, multifactorial disease influenced by dynamic interactions among genetic, epigenetic, environmental, and behavioral determinants that explicitly position genetics as the core. While advances in multi-omic integration have revolutionized our understanding of adiposity pathways, translation into personalized clinical nutrition remains a critical challenge. This review systematically consolidates emerging insights into the molecular and nutrigenomic architecture of obesity by integrating data from large-scale GWAS, functional epigenomics, nutrigenetic interactions, and microbiome-mediated metabolic programming. The primary aim is to systematically organize and synthesize recent genetic and genomic findings in obesity, while also highlighting how these discoveries can be contextualized within precision nutrition frameworks. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science up to July 2024 using MeSH terms, nutrigenomic-specific queries, and multi-omics filters. Eligible studies were classified into five domains: monogenic obesity, polygenic GWAS findings, epigenomic regulation, nutrigenomic signatures, and gut microbiome contributions. Over 127 candidate genes and 253 QTLs have been implicated in obesity susceptibility. Monogenic variants (e.g., <i>LEP</i>, <i>LEPR</i>, <i>MC4R</i>, <i>POMC</i>, <i>PCSK1</i>) explain rare, early-onset phenotypes, while <i>FTO</i> (polygenic) and <i>MC4R</i> (monogenic mutations as well as common polygenic variants) represent major loci across populations. Epigenetic mechanisms, dietary composition, physical activity, and microbial diversity significantly recalibrate obesity trajectories. Integration of genomics, functional epigenomics, precision nutrigenomics, and microbiome science presents transformative opportunities for personalized obesity interventions. However, translation into evidence-based clinical nutrition remains limited, emphasizing the need for functional validation, cross-ancestry mapping, and AI-driven precision frameworks. Specifically, this review systematically identifies and integrates evidence from genomics, epigenomics, nutrigenomics, and microbiome studies published between 2000 and 2024, applying structured inclusion/exclusion criteria and narrative synthesis to highlight translational pathways for precision nutrition.",Farzand A; Rohin MAK; Awan SJ; Ahmad AMR; Akram H; Saleem T; Imran MM,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41302083/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41290265,Dietary Intervention for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus patients based on HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 genotyping (DISH): a protocol for a randomised controlled study.,"SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease that is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, one of which is diet. Dietary intervention plays a role in the management of SLE, and precision nutrition based on genetic data may enhance its effectiveness. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 and DQ8 genotypes are strongly associated with coeliac disease (CD), and emerging evidence suggests a possible link between SLE and CD. However, no published studies have explored the use of HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 genotyping to guide dietary intervention in patients with SLE. This study aims to investigate the impact of dietary intervention, tailored to HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 genotyping, on disease activity and quality of life of patients with SLE. 90 patients with SLE with positive HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 genotyping will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either the intervention group or a control group. Participants in the intervention group will receive intervention in the form of a low-gluten dietary modification for 12 weeks. Participants in both groups will continue their usual SLE medications. During three research visits (weeks 0, 4 and 12), all participants will complete a clinical interview, blood sample collection, dietary assessment and a questionnaire. Disease activity and quality of life will be assessed by the Mexican Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index score and Lupus Quality of Life questionnaire. Other secondary outcomes that will also be assessed are fatigue score, sleep quality, anxiety and depression, and physical activity.

41274433,A smoothing method for DNA methylome analysis to enhance epigenomic signature detection in epigenome-wide association studies.,"Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) are instrumental for mapping DNA methylation changes in human traits and diseases but often suffer from low statistical power and false positives, especially in small cohorts. We developed an EWAS smoothing method that exploits co-methylation of adjacent CpG probes within CpG islands via a sliding-window average and generalized it using Savitzky-Golay filtering. We applied the smoothing approach-with window widths of 1-3 CpGs and, for generalization, Savitzky-Golay filters of varying polynomial orders and window sizes-across five distinct EWAS settings. Performance was quantified by signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), noise-variance reduction, variance ratio (VR), Bayes factors, and sample-size sensitivity. In the MMACHC epimutation dataset, a 5-CpG window (width, w = 2) increased SNR by 90 %, reduced noise variance by 80 %, and elevated VR by 176 % at the target CpG island, with no genome-wide false positives. For MLH1, smoothing preserved the top association and suppressed background signals. In the aging EWAS, a ""Polyepigenetic CpG aging score"" was derived following smoothing. This score correlated strongly with chronological age in the discovery cohort (Spearman's ρ = 0.89; P = 3.0 × 10<sup>-219</sup>) and was independently validated in a separate dataset, significantly distinguishing newborns from nonagenarians (P = 3.4 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). Savitzky-Golay filtering of order 0 with a 5-CpG window yielded optimal SNR across bootstrap iterations, supporting this configuration as a robust choice for methylation array smoothing. As an extension of the Savitzky-Golay-based smoothing framework, reanalysis of a liver cancer dataset identified five top loci surpassing a smoothed P-value threshold of 1 × 10<sup>-8</sup>. Among these, MIR10A within the HOXB3 locus was the only previously reported functionally relevant site. In conclusion, the smoothing method improves EWAS performance by enhancing SNR, enabling detection of meaningful associations even in small cohorts, and offers a valuable tool for reanalyzing existing Infinium methylation array datasets to uncover previously undetected epigenomic signatures.",Oussalah A; Mousel L; Trégouët DA; Guéant JL,"Methods (San Diego, Calif.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41274433/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41267246,Exploring the rare and abundant bacterial community structures and their metabolic differences in various types of qula cheese.,"Qula is a fermented cheese-like product made from yak milk. Although the bacterial communities in qula have been well documented, the diversity and functions of both abundant and rare bacterial subcommunities are still unclear. Here, our study examines the community structures of abundant and rare taxa, as well as their metabolite profiles, in the distinct qula samples from Tibet, China, employing high-throughput sequencing and untargeted metabolomics. Our results indicate that rare bacterial taxa account for 98.15 % of total operational taxonomic units and 48 % of total sequences. Dominant bacteria from abundant taxa consist of Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, and Acetobacter, while rare taxa contain Prevotella, Ruminococcus, and Butyrivibrio. Furthermore, we show that stochastic processes predominantly influence bacterial assembly in qula microbial communities. Specifically, stochastic processes have a more significant impact on community assembly for rare taxa, while deterministic processes are more important for abundant taxa. Moreover, we evaluate the contributions of rare taxa to network complexity and community stability, identifying potential keystone species. By analyzing metabolic profiles, we further compared the differences in metabolic functions between rare and abundant taxa in the qula microbiome. Our study shows that, along with abundant taxa, rare taxa in the qula microbiome play a significant role in community assembly and interactions, offering valuable insights into the microbial ecosystems of traditional fermented foods.",Huang X; Li R; Zhang L; Chen X; Gong X; Kang J,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41267246/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41263017,Paternal Folic Acid Supplementation Alleviated Hepatic Steatosis in Male Offspring Through Sperm DNA Methylation Modification.,"In recent years, studies have demonstrated a link between paternal preconception nutrient exposure and the phenotype of the offspring. However, there is a paucity of direct scientific evidence on the effects and the underlying mechanism of paternal folic acid supplementation (PFAS) on offspring phenotype. In this study, male mice were fed different doses of folic acid for 10 weeks, and then mated with females to produce offspring. In our findings, male offspring of PFAS fathers exhibit lower body weight and reduced hepatic lipid accumulation. Moreover, liver lipidomics analysis indicates the beneficial effect of PFAS on offspring hepatic lipid homeostasis. Offspring of PFAS exhibited altered gene expression patterns in the liver, with downregulation of several genes involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation signaling pathways. Mechanistically, whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) of paternal sperm revealed changes in gene expression of offspring liver depending on PFAS, including reproducibly increased methylation at the intron region of Acc1 and the promoter region of Scd1, the key gene of lipid metabolism, in the liver of PFAS offspring. However, these epigenetic findings are exploratory and require confirmation with a larger sample size. Overall, this study provides the first evidence of beneficial effect of paternal folic acid administration on preventing NAFLD in the offspring.",Song Y; Zhao L; Fu Z; Zhao G; Sun C; Gu W; Tian Z,Molecular nutrition & food research,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41263017/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41255949,Deacetylation of HSC70 by SIRT2 promotes chaperone mediated autophagy.,"Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a selective form of lysosomal protein degradation essential for cellular proteostasis. CMA is activated during cellular stress, such as starvation, and involves the chaperone protein HSC70 (HSPA8) recognizing substrates containing KFERQ-like motifs. However, the regulatory mechanisms governing CMA activation remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the NAD<sup>+</sup> -dependent deacetylase SIRT2 promotes CMA activation by deacetylating HSC70 at lysine 557 (K557). Our findings reveal that SIRT2 activity is upregulated during starvation, enhancing its interaction with HSC70 and facilitating the deacetylation of K557. Deacetylation of HSC70 at K557 increases its binding affinity to CMA substrates, thereby promoting their lysosomal degradation. Mutation of K557 to a deacetylation-mimetic arginine (K557R) enhances CMA activity under both nutrient-rich and starvation conditions, while the acetylation-mimetic glutamine mutant (K557Q) impairs substrate binding and CMA activation. Furthermore, the inhibition or knockdown of SIRT2 reduces CMA activity, which is rescued by HSC70 K557R expression. These findings identify SIRT2-mediated deacetylation of HSC70 as a regulatory mechanism for CMA activation during nutrient deprivation and highlight the role of protein lysine acetylation in proteostasis. This study provides insights into the interplay between SIRT2, HSC70, and CMA, with potential implications for diseases linked to proteostasis dysregulation, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer.",Ahn B; Chen W; Shi W; Shrestha R; Hu F; Lin H,Autophagy reports,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41255949/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41228448,Zinc as a Modulator of miRNA Signaling in Obesity.,"<b>Background</b>: Obesity is a multifactorial metabolic disorder influenced not only by excessive caloric intake but also by micronutrient imbalances such as zinc deficiency. Emerging evidence suggests that zinc regulates microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis and expression, linking nutritional status to metabolic regulation. <b>Objective</b>: This review delineates the molecular interplay between zinc and miRNAs in obesity, emphasizing the mechanistic, clinical, and translational relevance of zinc-sensitive miRNAs in adipogenesis, insulin resistance, inflammation, and oxidative stress. <b>Results</b>: Zinc deficiency alters miRNA expression profiles associated with metabolic dysregulation. Key miRNAs-miR-21, miR-34a, miR-122, and miR-144-3p-are consistently modulated by zinc status, influencing inflammation, lipid metabolism, and insulin signaling. Zinc repletion restores several miRNAs (e.g., miR-10b, miR-155, miR-145), suggesting reversibility, while excessive zinc may upregulate miR-144-3p and exacerbate oxidative stress. Circulating and exosomal miRNAs show promise as dynamic biomarkers for zinc intervention efficacy. <b>Methods</b>: A literature search was performed in 4 databases up to August 2025 using keywords related to zinc, miRNAs, and obesity. Eligible studies included both preclinical and human research evaluating zinc status or supplementation and miRNA expression in metabolic contexts. <b>Conclusion</b>: Maintaining optimal zinc levels may normalize miRNA expression and improve insulin sensitivity.

41228418,Nutritional Approaches in Neurodegenerative Disorders: A Mini Scoping Review with Emphasis on SPG11-Related Conditions.,"<b>Background:</b> Neurodegenerative diseases, including spastic paraplegia type 11 (SPG11), are complex disorders characterized by progressive neurological decline and significant metabolic disturbances. Spatacsin, the protein encoded by the SPG11 gene, plays a critical role in autophagy and lysosomal homeostasis, which are essential for neuronal health. Its impairment leads to defective cellular clearance and neurodegeneration. Recently, personalized and precision nutrition have emerged as promising approaches to enhance clinical outcomes by tailoring dietary interventions to individual genetic, metabolic, and phenotypic profiles. <b>Objectives:</b> This mini scoping review aimed to synthesize current evidence on the application of personalized and precision nutrition in SPG11 and to explore how insights from related neurodegenerative diseases could inform the development of future dietary and metabolic interventions for this rare disorder. <b>Methods:</b> Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, a scoping review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases (2020-2024). Eligible studies included investigations addressing nutritional, genomic, or metabolic interventions in neurodegenerative diseases. Of 30 screened papers, nine met the inclusion criteria, primarily focusing on nutritional and metabolic interventions related to neurodegenerative and neuromuscular conditions. <b>Results:</b> To date, no dietary intervention trials have been conducted specifically for SPG11. However, evidence from studies on related neurodegenerative diseases suggests that antioxidant, mitochondrial-supportive, and microbiota-targeted dietary approaches may beneficially influence key pathological processes such as oxidative stress, lipid dysregulation, and autophagy-core mechanisms that are also central to SPG11 pathophysiology. <b>Conclusions:</b> Although current evidence remains preliminary, personalized nutrition is a promising supplementary strategy for managing neurodegenerative diseases, including SPG11. Future research should incorporate systems-based approaches that combine dietary, metabolic, and neuroimaging assessments, with sex and comorbidity-stratified analyses, multi-omics profiling, and predictive modeling.

This followed our discovery of lipid metabolism-related genes in its complete genome. The high-precision complete genome map of L. gasseri TF08-1 was constructed for the first time, revealing enriched lipid metabolism pathways, including bile salt hydrolase activity and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. After supplementing L. gasseri TF08-1 for 8 weeks in mice fed with a high-fat diet, the serum triglyceride (TG) level decreased by 41.95%, the hepatic total cholesterol (TC) level decreased by 35.09%, and the TNF-α level decreased by 42.91%. Meanwhile, the NAS score decreased by 3.66 points. The treatment significantly reduced hepatic lipid accumulation, lowered proinflammatory cytokines, and improved steatosis scores. Metagenomic analyses showed L. gasseri TF08-1 restored gut microbiota balance, significantly increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Phocaeicola vulgatus, while also enriching fatty acid degradation pathways. Lactobacillu gasseri TF08-1 demonstrates probiotic efficacy against NAFLD through dual mechanisms: direct metabolic modulation and gut microbiota restoration.

We developed a kiwifruit-derived synbiotic combining <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> LP220 with kiwifruit powder and evaluated its effects in <i>vitro</i> and in an adenine and potassium oxonate mouse HUA model (8 weeks). In <i>vitro</i>, LP220 produced propionate 2.528 ± 0.369 μg/10<sup>9</sup> CFU/mL and butyrate 36.06 ± 2.353 μg/10<sup>9</sup> CFU/mL. In <i>vivo</i>, the synbiotic lowered serum uric acid by 62.27% versus untreated HUA (<i>P</i> < 0.01) and outperformed LP220 or kiwifruit alone, increasing fecal/serum and urinary/serum uric acid ratios by 242.99 and 117.49% (<i>P</i> < 0.01). Fecal and serum propionate and butyrate rose 38.01-129.34% (<i>P</i> < 0.01), accompanied by reduced systemic inflammation (serum LPS - 38.81%; IL-1β - 23.74%). Mechanistically, the synbiotic decreased hepatic xanthine oxidase activity and upregulated ABCG2 expression in colon and kidney, with recovery of gut diversity and enrichment of SCFAs-producers. These results indicate the kiwifruit synbiotic suppresses urate synthesis and promotes excretion via SCFA-mediated microbiota-host interactions, suggesting a microbiota-targeted nutritional strategy for HUA.",Wang Q; Pu X; Song Y; Lv Z; Hao J; Yuan T; Wang Y; Liu X; Guo R; Liu Z,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41178129/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41155501,Does Genetic Variation in Detoxification Capacity Influence Hepatic Biomarker Responses to a Liver Support Supplementation Regimen?,"Genetic polymorphisms contribute to inter-individual variation in liver detoxification, influencing susceptibility to exposures and responses to interventions. While urinary biomarkers reflect Phase II activity, the impact of genotype on supplementation response remains unclear. In a pilot, prospective, open-label cohort study, 30 Austrian adults completed an 8-week multi-ingredient liver support supplementation regimen (e.g., glutathione, N-acetylcysteine, α-lipoic acid). First-morning urine was collected at baseline and follow-up for measurement of D-glucaric acid, mercapturic acids, and creatinine. Dried blood spots were genotyped for polymorphisms in detoxification genes (<i>CYP1A1</i>, <i>GSTM1</i>, <i>GSTP1</i>, <i>GSTT1</i>, and <i>NQO1</i>), and participants were stratified into normal (NDC) or limited (LDC) detoxification capacity groups. Adherence was monitored through logs, mid-study interviews, and product counts. The intervention led to modest reductions in body weight (-0.87 kg, <i>p</i> < 0.05) and BMI (-0.31 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <i>p</i> < 0.05), and significant increases in urinary D-glucaric acid (<i>p</i> < 0.05) and mercapturic acids (<i>p</i> < 0.01), with consistent responses across detoxification genotype groups (<i>p</i> > 0.05). The pattern of biomarker responses based on clinically defined categories did not differ significantly between the study groups (adjusted odds ratio = 2.88, <i>p</i> > 0.05). The observed increases in urinary biomarkers and reductions in weight and BMI are consistent with potential modulation of detoxification pathways following liver support supplementation, independent of genetic polymorphisms influencing detoxification capacity.",Schauer M; Mair S; Keiner M; Werner C; Kainz F; Motevalli M,International journal of molecular sciences,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41155501/,0,0,0,0,0,1

Food-based antibiotic testing is crucial for preventing antibiotic misuse and protecting human health. However, traditional analytical methods exhibit high equipment dependency, restricting on-site detection in hills, plateaus, and other regions with inconvenient transportation. This study developed an integrated CRISPR/Cas12a-activated liposomal Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) amplification system within a microfluidic chip for ultrasensitive ampicillin detection. The method achieves primary signal amplification by converting ampicillin concentration into a DNA signal through catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA), followed by secondary signal amplification using an Au@Ag substrate coupled with SERS technology for 4-MPBA@liposome marker detection. The platform demonstrated a linear detection range of 1 fM-1 nM with a limit of detection as low as 740 aM.

This investigation, however, uncovered a surprisingly beneficial effect of these compounds on bone metabolism. In elderly Chinese subjects, bone mineral density (BMD) correlated positively with serum p,p'dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) levels, independent of diabetic status. Mice exposed to DDE orally exhibited increased bone mass, accelerated regeneration of bone defects, and reduced bone loss following ovariectomy. In cultured osteoblasts, DDE treatment promoted matrix mineralization, accompanied by altered gene profiles implicating downstream targets of the cellular communication network factor 3 (CCN3) signaling pathway. Additional studies demonstrated that DDE upregulated CCN3 signaling in osteoblasts by relieving FOXO1 inhibition.

41097253,Lactoferrin and Osteopontin Cooperatively Promote Intestinal Epithelial Maturation in Neonatal Mice by Activating the Brg1/Notch1/Hes1 Pathway.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Early life is crucial for infant gut development and intestinal homeostasis. Lactoferrin (LF) and osteopontin (OPN) are bioactive breast milk proteins that are supplemented into infant formula to promote gut development. However, the combined effect of LF and OPN (LOP) on in vivo gut maturation has not been fully elucidated. This study investigated the effects of LF, OPN, and LOP on intestinal epithelium maturation in C57BL/6N mice from postnatal days 7 to 21. <b>Methods:</b> 3-day-old pups were assigned to four groups: Control group, LF group: 300 mg/kg LF; OPN group: 300 mg/kg OPN, LOP group: 300 mg/kg of a 1:5 (w/w) mixture of LF and OPN. <b>Results:</b> Compared to controls, LOP reduced plasma Diamine Oxidase (DAO) activity by 1.54-fold and D-lactate levels by 1.41-fold, demonstrating greater efficacy than LF or OPN alone in reducing intestinal permeability. LOP also significantly increased intestinal absorptive cells versus controls or single proteins. Mechanistically, LOP promoted directional intestinal stem cell differentiation, increasing jejunal transit-amplifying cells by 1.40-fold in 21-day-old mice. LOP upregulated expression of the Notch pathway target Hes1 by 1.70-fold. Further investigations revealed LOP activated Notch signaling via the transcription factor Brg1. Validation using intestinal organoids and IEC-6 cells confirmed intact OPN within LOP mediates increased Brg1 expression, activating the Notch pathway to direct intestinal stem cell differentiation into absorptive cells. <b>Conclusions:</b> Collectively, these findings in neonatal mice suggest that LOP cooperatively enhances intestinal barrier maturation and directs stem cell differentiation via Brg1-Notch signaling, offering potential insights for future research on bioactive protein supplementation in infant nutrition.",Zhang W; Li C; Bi R; Lu Y; Zhang Y; Shi C; Qiao Z; Sun Y; Chen J; Wang P; Wang R; Ren F; Li Y,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41097253/,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, response to dietary interventions varies, potentially due to genetic variations influencing metabolic pathways. This review highlights key gene-diet interactions relevant to CKD management, including risk factors and comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and proteinuria. Variants in the <i>ACE</i> gene influence salt sensitivity and blood pressure responses, while <i>TCF7L2</i> polymorphisms affect the relationship between dietary glycemic load and diabetes risk, impacting kidney complications. Protein intake, a key modifier of CKD, correlates with proteinuria risk, moderated by a <i>PPM1K</i> polymorphism. Dietary bioactives, such as caffeine, may also alter the progression rate of proteinuria and hypertension, with effects contingent upon <i>CYP1A2</i> genotype. Additional markers of cardiovascular disease, CKD-associated bone-mineral disease, and CKD anemia are also discussed as well as role of the gut microbiome in nutrition modulation and vice versa. The review concludes with the potential of artificial intelligence as a clinical tool to refine precision nutrition, enabling clinicians to adopt targeted approaches, stratified by genetic-metabolic patient profiles that match best nutritional interventions for prevention and management of CKD.

In this study, the core binding region was derived by tailoring existing C. sakazakii aptamer, and novel aptamer screening libraries were designed based on this core sequences with high affinity and specificity. Additionally, we performed the first screening of C. sakazakii DNAzyme and explored its binding sites with the aid of molecular docking. Based on the aptamer, DNAzyme, G-quadruplex, and RCA reaction, an ultra-sensitive visual C. sakazakii sensor was developed. This sensor achieves C. sakazakii enrichment via aptamer-magnetic bead conjunction and converts bacterial count to nucleic acid count signals through DNAzyme.

41043686,Ingestive Behavior and Precision Nutrition: Part of the Puzzle.,"The marked individual variability in response to common dietary exposures necessitates tailoring of dietary guidance to individuals, or small groups of individuals with similar needs, to optimize health. This is a complex task requiring integration of environmental, cultural, psychological, and biological contributions. Work in the area of precision nutrition is an effort to translate science into practice. A research roadmap developed through a National Institutes of Health conference identified many of the inputs that require quantification. Better characterization of ingestive behaviors is one key area. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize current understanding of the influences of age, sex, body mass index, ethnicity, and genetics on ingestive behaviors, including culture, sensory function, appetite, dietary intake, the gut-brain axis, and microbiome. To do so, the extant literature was accessed through search engines relevant to the various topics covered. Outcomes assessed varied topically. In addition to compiling evidence on the nature and magnitude of these relationships, this review highlights the degree of individual variability in attributes or responses to an intervention. More broadly, it documents: 1) that cause-and-effect relationships are difficult to establish as most are dynamic and interactive; 2) there are inherent and learned contributions to both behavior and biology that will require different considerations and offer different opportunities for manipulation; 3) a focus on intuitive approaches may not be as successful as desired; 4) that external influences can, and often do, override internal influences of biology; and 5) there are multiple ways to construct healthful diets. At the same time, it is vital that improved methods to characterize the multiple relevant inputs to ingestive behavior be developed. It is hoped that the evidence compiled here will inform efforts to develop precision nutrition guidance.",Biruete A; Buobu PS; Considine RV; Met Hoxha E; Eicher-Miller HA; Kinzig KP; Panjwani AA; Running CA; Rutigliani G; Savaiano DA; Veile A; Wolf PG; Mattes RD,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41043686/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41038510,Honey bee nutritranscriptomics reveals key insights towards precision nutrition.,"Honey bees are essential managed pollinators faced by nutritional deficiencies which contributes to worldwide colony losses. The integration of nutrition science with genomics offers a powerful approach to optimize honey bee health by augmenting immune function and resilience to stressors through precision diet interventions. To uncover the impact of honey bee genetics on core physiological responses to natural and artificial diets. Two honey bee genetic backgrounds (Russian and Pol-line) were fed diets consisting of sugar, pollen, and microalgae biomass from either Chlorella vulgaris or spirulina. Nutrigenetic variation was assessed by body weight measurements followed by transcriptome sequencing. Standard differential gene expression analysis and supervised machine learning algorithms were used to measure genotype-specific transcriptional responses to the diets. Known (i.e., vitellogenin and Jhe, hex70a) and novel (i.e., Glob1, slif and sad) biomarkers of nutritional health exhibited a significant genetics-by-diet interaction. Furthermore, Russian bees featured a contracted transcriptional response, and a transcriptomic signature of delayed behavioral maturation as compared to Pol-line bees, suggesting alternative nutrient assimilation strategies between the two genetic backgrounds. Regardless of diet, Russian bees had significantly lower abundance of a major viral pathogen (DWV). Lastly, higher expression of humoral and cellular immune genes was detected in microalgae-fed bees, though spirulina was significantly more immunogenic than Chlorella. Genetic background plays a key role in shaping honey bee responses to nutrition. By identifying novel biomarkers of nutritional status, our results support the unique benefits of two microalgae species as functional feed additives. Furthermore, these results reveal the importance of genetics as a consideration when optimizing supplemental feed for an agricultural pollinator. These findings contribute towards the development of tailored nutrition strategies and artificial diets to improve honey bee health.",McMenamin A; Ricigliano V,Journal of advanced research,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41038510/,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, the mechanisms underlying their regulation of the gut microbiota-metabolite axis, signaling pathways, and multiomics interactions, as well as the key bioactive components responsible for their efficacy variations, remain poorly characterized. This study investigated the protective effects of <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i> 1.0320 (probiotic, 1.0320) and heat-killed <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus 1.0320</i> (postbiotic, HK 1.0320) on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC). Results demonstrated that HK1.0320 significantly alleviated UC symptoms, mitigated colonic damage, restored the intestinal barrier, attenuated oxidative stress, regulated MPO activity, suppressed TLR4/MAPK/NF-κB pathway key proteins (TLR4, MyD88, JNK, p38, and p65), decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, modulated gut microbiota, and enhanced SCFA production. Untargeted metabolomics revealed that HK1.0320 is rich in bioactive components such as carboxylic acids and alleviates UC through its own or intestinal metabolic modification. This study clarifies the postbiotic colitis-relief mechanism and highlights their potential in functional foods or precision nutrition.",Zhang J; Tan Z; Tian Z; Zhao M; Qian S; Feng H; Chang Y; Hou J; Jiang Z,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41037341/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41036659,"Klotho, Kidneys, and Micronutrient Signaling: A Promising Paradigm for Healthy Aging.","Klotho, a transmembrane protein with pleiotropic antiaging properties, is increasingly recognized as a central regulator of longevity and metabolic resilience. Primarily expressed in the kidneys and brain, Klotho governs phosphate and calcium homeostasis, modulates redox signaling, and influences key metabolic pathways, including PI3K/AKT and IGF-1. Declining Klotho expression is associated with both biological and chronological aging and has been mechanistically implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration, and metabolic dysfunction. Klotho expression is modifiable through diet, in preclinical and observational studies, offering a promising avenue for delaying cellular aging and preserving physiological function. Micronutrients such as magnesium, vitamin D, folate, and vitamin B12, as well as phytochemicals including sulforaphane and curcumin, have been shown to modulate Klotho expression through redox-sensitive and transcriptional mechanisms. Macronutrient balance, particularly carbohydrate quality and saturated fat intake, also plays a critical role in maintaining Klotho activity via insulin sensitivity, mitochondrial integrity, and inflammatory signaling. Inflammatory dietary profiles, quantified through tools such as the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII), have been inversely associated with serum α-Klotho concentrations and biological age acceleration. This review critically synthesizes current knowledge on nutrient-specific and dietary pattern-level influences on Klotho, with emphasis on antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and epigenetically active compounds. In parallel, the Klotho-FGF23 axis is examined regarding dietary calcium and phosphate regulation, highlighting the distinct effects of whole food-derived versus supplemental calcium on mineral metabolism and vascular health. Klotho emerges as a potential modifiable determinant with current limitations as a potential biomarker within precision nutrition strategies aimed at extending health span and attenuating age-related disease risk. Key concepts discussed include dietary factors in Klotho modulation and chronic disease prevention. Opportunities and limitations of soluble Klotho as a multifaceted biomarker of human health and longevity are highlighted.",Mahdavi S,Lifestyle genomics,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41036659/,1,0,0,0,0,0

A total of 2,760 skin metagenomes from 6 published skin studies were collected. A skin virome catalog was constructed using standard methods in the viromics field. Viral characteristics were identified through cross-cohort meta-analysis and used to characterize viral features across different skin environments. We identified 20,927 viral sequences, which clustered into 2,873 viral operational taxonomic units (vOTUs), uncovering a substantial breadth of viral diversity on human skin. The results also highlight significant differences in viral communities that are associated with varying skin microenvironments. The oily skin is enriched in <i>Papillomaviridae</i>, the dry skin area is enriched in <i>Autographiviridae</i> and <i>Inoviridae</i>, and the moist skin is enriched in <i>Herelleviridae</i>. We also investigated the relationship between bacteriophages and bacteria on the skin surface. We found that skin bacteria such as <i>Pseudomonas</i>, <i>Klebsiella</i>, and <i>Staphylococcus</i> are predicted to be infected by phages from the class <i>Caudoviricetes</i>. This comprehensive skin DNA viral catalog significantly advances our understanding of the virome's role within the skin ecosystem. This study presents a comprehensive reference catalog of the human skin DNA virome, constructed from 2,760 metagenomic datasets collected globally. It identified 20,927 viral sequences, with 90.85% representing previously unknown viruses, greatly expanding our understanding of skin viral diversity. The findings reveal significant differences in viral communities between distinct skin microenvironments (oily, dry, and moist) and highlight close interactions between bacteriophages and their bacterial hosts, suggesting a potential role for the virome in maintaining microbial balance and skin health. This extensive skin viral catalog constitutes a crucial resource for future epidemiological and therapeutic research, potentially facilitating the development of novel phage therapies and diagnostic markers for skin disorders.",Li Z; Li S; Han C; Chen Y; Zhen H; Sun Y; Zhou X; Chen Y; Zheng Y; Han L; Krutmann J; Nie C; Wang J; Xia J,Microbiology spectrum,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41025824/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Our previous study has already reported the prevention of AD by 2'-FL in mice; in this study, the effects of 2'-FL in AD were evaluated. Five month-old male 5 × FAD mice were gavaged with 2'-FL for 11 weeks, and 2 mg of 2'-FL significantly improved cognitive deficits, even restoring them to the normal level. The destroyed neurons, damaged synaptic plasticity characterized by decreased cholinergic neurons and glutaminergic neurons, and the activation of microglial cells were all significantly improved by 2'-FL. 2'-FL also significantly down-regulated mRNA expression of <i>Il-6</i> and <i>Il-1</i>β and alleviated oxidative damages through the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway to up-regulate <i>Nqo1</i> expression. AD-increased PC (18:4/20:5) and DG (18:4/22:6/0:0) in the feces and serum were both decreased by 2'-FL, which was significantly positively correlated with inflammation and negatively correlated with synaptic plasticity.

41005197,Bioaccessible compounds from bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) landraces activate PPARγ in transiently transfected HepG2 cells.,"Common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) are a nutrient-dense staple food associated with a reduced risk of noncommunicable chronic diseases. One proposed mechanism involves the modulation of nuclear receptors, particularly peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), which are key regulators of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. In this study, we evaluated the effects of in vitro digested flours, secondary metabolite-enriched extracts (SMEEs), their fractions, and selected representative phytochemicals from 14 landraces and 2 commercial P. vulgaris samples to directly activate PPARs and other nuclear receptors using a luciferase reporter assay in transiently transfected HepG2 cells. We hypothesized that bioaccessible compounds from the digested landraces would directly activate PPARγ in HepG2 cells. Digested flours from landraces such as Magnum and Peumo significantly activated both PPARγ1 and PPARγ2, reaching values up to 1.54-fold higher than the controls (P < .05). Corresponding SMEEs showed stronger activities, with up to 2.32-fold activation compared to the controls (P < .05). In contrast, none of the polarity-based fractions or the major identified phytochemicals (kaempferol-3-O-glycoside, sojasaponin Ba and Bb) showed significant effects. These findings demonstrate that digested P. vulgaris matrices contain bioaccessible compounds capable of directly activating PPARγ in HepG2 cells, likely through synergistic interactions or unidentified constituents. This mechanistic evidence supports the functional relevance of traditional bean landraces in precision nutrition strategies targeting metabolic health.",Eckhof P; Nina N; Bauer S; Kufer TA; Frank J; Jiménez-Aspee F,"Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41005197/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41002985,Impact of Dietary Interventions on the Human Plasma and Lipoprotein Lipidome.,"Lipids are structurally diverse biomolecules that play essential roles in cellular function, energy storage, and signaling. The human lipidome, a dynamic and complex subset of the metabolome, is shaped by both endogenous factors, such as genetics, sex, age, and metabolic health, and exogenous influences like lifestyle, diet, and microbiota. Among these, diet stands out as one of the most modifiable and impactful determinants, influencing lipid composition across plasma, serum, and lipoprotein fractions. While traditional lipid profiling provides limited insight, lipidomics enables comprehensive characterization of lipid species, revealing mechanistic links between lipid metabolism and diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), metabolic syndrome (MetS), and inflammatory disorders. This review explores: (1) the relationship between lipid profiles and CVD risk, (2) the internal and external modulators of the lipidome, and (3) current evidence on how specific dietary patterns, including Mediterranean, Nordic, low glycemic, and vegetarian diets, and individual nutrients such as omega-3 fatty acids (FAs), plant sterols, and mycoprotein, influence lipidomic profiles. Advances in lipidomics highlight that dietary fat quality, food matrix, and eating patterns can significantly modulate lipid species such as triacylglycerols (TAGs), ceramides (Cers), and phospholipids, with implications for cardiometabolic health. Notably, distinct responses are observed across plasma High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) and Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) lipidomes, emphasizing the need for compartment-specific analyses. Understanding these diet-lipidome interactions offers promising avenues for precision nutrition and the development of lipid-based biomarkers for disease prevention and management.",Casas R; Sánchez-García ND; Estruch R; López-Yerena A,Metabolites,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41002985/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40966548,Vitamin D Deficiency Exacerbates d-Galactose-Induced Intestinal Barrier Dysfunction in a Murine Model of Intestinal Aging.,"Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in the elderly population. The molecular mechanisms by which vitamin D influences the intestinal function in aging remain poorly understood. To address this, a 16 week dietary intervention using a vitamin D<sub>3</sub>-withdraw diet (VDD) combined with d-galactose treatment was conducted in mice. We assessed the gut barrier integrity, immune response, and changes in microbiota composition. In the context of d-galactose-induced aging, VDD significantly reduced serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> levels and exacerbated intestinal permeability and downregulation of ZO-1 and Occludin. VDD led to transcriptional suppression of antiviral defense and antigen presentation pathways in the colon, which correlated with decreased expression of the vitamin D receptor. Additionally, VDD caused detrimental shifts in the gut microbiota, characterized by a decline in beneficial genera including <i>Lactobacillus</i> and an increase in pathogenic genera including <i>Allobaculum</i>. These findings highlight the essential role of vitamin D in maintaining intestinal barrier function, antiviral immunity, and microbiota homeostasis during aging.",Feng X; Li J; Meng Y; Jing Y; Qian H; Zhang W; Liu R; Wang D; Zhang W; Hao Y; Gan D; Shi W,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40966548/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40947393,"Habitual coffee intake, genetic susceptibility and multimorbidity of non-communicable chronic diseases trajectory: a prospective study from UK biobank.","Global population aging has increased multimorbidity of non-communicable diseases (MNCDs). Coffee bioactive compounds may influence chronic disease pathways, yet their role in MNCDs progression is unclear. This study examines how habitual coffee intake affects transitions from first NCD to MNCDs and subsequent mortality. Based on the application of the Cox proportional hazards and multi-state models to the UK Biobank cohort data, this study found that among the 60,616 participants who developed at least one non-communicable disease (NCD), 9938 progressed to MNCDs. Compared with non-coffee drinkers, individuals consuming fewer than 3 cups of coffee daily had a reduced risk of transitioning from an NCD-free state to a first NCD [HR = 0.91, 95 %CI:0.89-0.93(0-1 cups/day); HR = 0.89, 95 %CI:0.87-0.91(1-3 cups/day)] and from a first NCD to MNCDs [HR = 0.85, 95 %CI:0.80-0.90(0-1cups/day); HR = 0.85,95 %CI:0.81-0.90(1-3cups/day)]. Conversely consuming exceeding 5 cups/day was associated with an increased risk of progression from a first NCD to MNCDs (HR = 1.26, 95 %CI:1.17-1.36) and from MNCDs to death (HR:1.19, 95 %CI:1.04-1.36). The association between high coffee intake (>5 cups/day) and increased risk of progression to MNCDs was more pronounced in participants with the slowest caffeine metabolism (HR = 1.54, 95 %CI: 1.32-1.80), but attuned in those with the fastest caffeine metabolism (HR = 1.17, 95 %CI: 1.03-1.32). Habitual coffee consumption of fewer 3 cups/day is associated with a lower risk of developing NCDs and MNCDs, whereas intake exceeding 5 cups/day increases the risk of MNCDs and mortality in those with MNCDs, particularly among individuals with slower caffeine metabolism.",Xue Y; Jiang W; Tang Y; Niu F; Liu H; Yang R; Qiao C; Zuo Y; Han T; Wei W; Li S,"Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40947393/,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, the structure, function, and molecular mechanism of FAS regulating lipid synthesis in the fungus Mucor circinelloides are unclear. In the present study, two encoding fas genes in the high lipid-producing strain WJ11 and low lipid-producing strain CBS277.49 from M. circinelloides based on their genome database were identified and annotated respectively. Bioinformatic analysis confirmed the presence of typical conserved domains in FAS proteins. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the evolutionary relationship of these FAS proteins, and the FAS proteins from WJ11 have similar properties as their counterparts in CBS277.49. Furthermore, transcriptional profiling displayed marked differences in the expression of these fas genes, and fas1 was analyzed to predict the possible functions in lipid metabolism in the high lipid-producing strain WJ11. This is the first report on the structures and functions of FAS proteins in M. circinelloides.

40897609,Translational biomarkers for integrated cardiovascular disease risk assessment: A multidisciplinary review with applications in precision medicine.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, significantly impacting healthcare systems and individual lives. This pragmatic review focuses on the assessment of CVD utilizing traditional and emerging risk factors that provide a basis for personalized medicine and precision nutrition, highlighting the knowledge and application of these insights for accurate risk diagnosis, individualized interventions, and precise outcome/evaluation prognosis. Critical biochemical markers such as lipid metabolism signatures, inflammatory molecules, endocrine mediators, homeostatic signals (including omics data), and lifestyle factors such as unhealthy dietary habits, physical inactivity, smoking, alcohol abuse, along with anthropometric variables and body composition measurements, play a pivotal role in assessing and managing CVD. This progression starts with early vascular and cardiac dysfunctions, advancing to atherosclerosis, and ultimately leading to cardiovascular events. Major adverse cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure, highlight the need for effective and accurate risk stratification and objective assessment. Various CVD risk scores, such as the Framingham Risk Score, SCORE, and the Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Calculator, provide valuable global frameworks for predicting individual risk based on recognized conventional factors. Additionally, omics markers-which encompass genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and metagenomic data-offer deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying CVD, alongside novel lipidomic and immunomic determinants.

A total of 336 Hy-line brown layer hens aged 55 weeks were randomly assigned to three groups using a completely randomized design: control group (Con, basal diet), ADY group (1 g ADY/kg diet), and ADY-BS combination group ([1 g ADY + 0.1 g BS]/kg diet). Compared with the Con group, ADY-BS group significantly improved egg production (<i>P =</i> 0.024) and reduced feed conversion ratio (<i>P =</i> 0.034), while also significantly increasing feed intake compared to the ADY group (<i>P =</i> 0.020). Additionally, both ADY and ADY-BS significantly enhanced eggshell-breaking strength compared to untreated hens (<i>P <</i> 0.001), with ADY-BS further notably increasing lysozyme levels (<i>P =</i> 0.031), antibody titers against avian influenza H5 and H9 subtypes (<i>P</i> = 0.008 and <i>P</i> = 0.001, respectively), and calcium content in serum (<i>P =</i> 0.021). Analysis of the ileal microbiota revealed significant modifications, as evidenced by reduced richness (Chao1 index: <i>P</i> = 0.016 and <i>P</i> = 0.008 for the ADY and ADY-BS groups, respectively) and improved evenness (Simpson index: <i>P</i> = 0.032 for both groups).

Furthermore, <i>Lactobacillus</i> enriched in ADY-BS group hens was negatively correlated with ileum differential metabolites such as phenylalanyl-threonine and phenylalanyl-tryptophan. Correlation analysis based on RNA-seq data indicated that these differential metabolites were negatively associated with the expression of genes related to calcium ion transport and immune pathways in the uterus.

Particularly contrasting patterns of dietary adaptations are expected in populations living in tropical versus extreme cold environments. This article explores the genetic, dietary, and microbiome-related adaptations in populations of South Asia and the Arctic. We review adaptations related to high-carbohydrate, plant-based diets in South Asians and compare these against adaptations in Arctic populations who have evolved to rely on fat- and protein-rich diets from marine and animal sources. We discuss how these genetic adaptations interact with traditional diets and microbiomes, and the implications for chronic disease risks as modern, westernized diets disrupt ancestral gene-diet-microbiome interactions. By comparing these regions, we highlight the need for genome-based nutrition created strategies that account for genetic diversity, local dietary traditions, and environmental context to promote precision health and prevent diet-related chronic diseases.

40892695,Integrative Genomics and Phenotypic Profiling Reveal Lacticplantibacillus plantarum BGI-N6 as a Multifunctional Candidate for Dermatological Probiotic Development.,"Probiotics and postbiotics are recognized for their potential to benefit skin health, and complete genome analysis serves as a pivotal tool to accelerate the exploration of probiotic functionalities. To investigate this relationship, this study aimed to elucidate the skin-promoting potential of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum BGI-N6 (BGI-N6) through integrated genomic analysis and phenotypic analysis. Results indicated that the high-precision complete genome of BGI-N6 comprises 3 257 641 bases with a 45% GC content and 3030 CDSs, involving multiple genes related to carbon source fermentation, gastrointestinal tolerance, and environmental adaptability. Notably, BGI-N6 possessed several bacteriostatic, antioxidant, and enzyme activity inhibition-related genes, which could encode the biosynthetic pathways of bacteriocins, glutathione/thioredoxin antioxidant systems, NADH peroxidase, catalase, and various organic acids. Supporting these genomic insights, in vitro experiments comparative evaluation revealed that BGI-N6 exhibited superior capabilities relative to Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 299v (299v) in antioxidant activity, inhibition of cutaneous pathogens growth, and suppression of skin-damaging enzyme (e.g., collagenase and elastase) activity. These effects were correlated with the production of lactic acid, 6-hydroxyhexanoate, coumarins, and other bioactive compounds by BGI-N6.

Targeting these early changes through dietary interventions may reduce AD risk in asymptomatic carriers. This study evaluated whether a ketogenic diet (KD) could reshape the gut microbiome and enhance key brain metabolite levels in young APOE4 mice, using APOE3 mice as a neutral-risk comparison. Male and female APOE3 and APOE4 mice were fed either a control diet or KD for 16 weeks, starting at 12 weeks of age. We used shotgun metagenomics and targeted brain metabolomics to identify microbe-metabolite signatures linked to neuroprotection. KD increased beneficial species such as Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lactobacillus reuteri while reducing pathogenic Bacteroides intestinalis. These microbial shifts correlated with improved brain metabolites related to mitochondrial function, neurotransmitter balance, redox homeostasis, and lipid metabolism. Notably, Lactobacillus species and B. intestinalis exhibited inverse correlations with key brain metabolite levels, suggesting their roles as both modulators and biomarkers of brain health. APOE4 females showed the greatest benefits, including restored microbiome diversity and normalization of brain metabolite levels. In contrast, APOE3 mice showed microbiome changes but limited brain metabolic responses. These findings highlight KD's potential to reprogram the gut-brain axis in a genotype- and sex-dependent manner, supporting its use as a precision nutrition strategy to reduce AD risk, particularly in asymptomatic female APOE4 carriers.",Ivanich K; Yackzan A; Flemister A; Chang YH; Xing X; Chen A; Yanckello LM; Sun M; Aware C; Govindarajan M; Kramer S; Ericsson A; Lin AL,Journal of neurochemistry,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40890565/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40884172,Interindividual Genetic Differences Drive Discordance Between Serum Calcidiol and Calcitriol Concentrations in Females.,"Vitamin D insufficiency (VDI) is primarily determined by serum levels of calcidiol, which serves as a biomarker for the less abundant but most potent bioactive metabolite, calcitriol. However, population studies often show discordance between calcidiol and calcitriol. Here, a genetically diverse population of 7 inbred mouse strains was used to investigate the role of interindividual genetic differences in driving calcidiol-to-calcitriol discordance under vitamin D sufficient (VDS) vs depleted (VDD) conditions. We found high interstrain variability in calcitriol that was discordant with calcidiol under VDS and VDD conditions. However, under VDS conditions, stratification by calcitriol level revealed that strains with serum calcitriol >60 pM (HighC) exhibited the expected positive calcidiol-to-calcitriol association, whereas strains with low calcitriol (<60 pM, LowC) did not. Thus, discordance under VDS was driven by genetically divergent strains with LowC. Discordance under VDD was not associated with LowC. LowC was not caused by increased calcitriol degradation or by transcriptional dysregulation of canonical vitamin D metabolism enzymes. Instead, LowC strains exhibited low renal expression of Lrp2 (megalin), the primary transporter required for renal calcitriol production. LowC strains also exhibited reduced renal expression of the vitamin D receptor (Vdr) and several target genes, demonstrating impaired vitamin D signaling. These findings reveal novel, naturally occurring genetic determinants of VDI that function by disrupting calcitriol production and signaling in a manner that cannot be predicted by calcidiol levels.

40871725,Integrating Precision Medicine and Digital Health in Personalized Weight Management: The Central Role of Nutrition.,"Obesity is a global health challenge marked by substantial inter-individual differences in responses to dietary and lifestyle interventions. Traditional weight loss strategies often overlook critical biological variations in genetics, metabolic profiles, and gut microbiota composition, contributing to poor adherence and variable outcomes. Our primary aim is to identify key biological and behavioral effectors relevant to precision medicine for weight control, with a particular focus on nutrition, while also discussing their current and potential integration into digital health platforms. Thus, this review aligns more closely with the identification of influential factors within precision medicine (e.g., genetic, metabolic, and microbiome factors) but also explores how these factors are currently integrated into digital health tools. We synthesize recent advances in nutrigenomics, nutritional metabolomics, and microbiome-informed nutrition, highlighting how tailored dietary strategies-such as high-protein, low-glycemic, polyphenol-enriched, and fiber-based diets-can be aligned with specific genetic variants (e.g., FTO and MC4R), metabolic phenotypes (e.g., insulin resistance), and gut microbiota profiles (e.g., <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> abundance, SCFA production). In parallel, digital health tools-including mobile health applications, wearable devices, and AI-supported platforms-enhance self-monitoring, adherence, and dynamic feedback in real-world settings. Mechanistic pathways such as gut-brain axis regulation, microbial fermentation, gene-diet interactions, and anti-inflammatory responses are explored to explain inter-individual differences in dietary outcomes. However, challenges such as cost, accessibility, and patient motivation remain and should be addressed to ensure the effective implementation of these integrated strategies in real-world settings. Collectively, these insights underscore the pivotal role of precision nutrition as a cornerstone for personalized, scalable, and sustainable obesity interventions.",Liu X; Xu M; Wang H; Zhu L,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40871725/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40869189,<i>Ajuba</i> as a Potential Nutrition-Responsive Biomarker for the Prevention of Age-Related Sarcopenia.,"Sarcopenia, the age-related decline in skeletal muscle mass and function, is a growing health concern in aging populations. Nutritional interventions are increasingly recognized for their therapeutic potential; however, molecular biomarkers that reflect their efficacy are limited. To identify nutrition-responsive genes relevant to sarcopenia, we performed transcriptomic profiling of gastrocnemius muscle from mature and middle-aged mice. Aging-associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were filtered based on expression levels and correlation with muscle mass. Functional food interventions, including high- and low-molecular-weight collagen hydrolysates and allulose, were applied, and effect scores were calculated to assess transcriptomic responsiveness. <i>Ajuba</i>, a gene involved in cytoskeletal regulation and tissue remodeling, was significantly downregulated in middle-aged mice, consistent with aging-associated muscle decline. Dietary supplementation restored <i>Ajuba</i> expression across all intervention groups, with the strongest effect observed in the high-molecular-weight collagen group. <i>Ajuba</i> expression also showed strong positive correlations with tibialis anterior mass, hindlimb thickness, and muscle-to-fat ratio. <i>Ajuba</i> was identified as a nutritionally modifiable gene with strong associations to muscle phenotype and dietary response. These findings support <i>Ajuba</i> as a transcriptomic biomarker and potential molecular target for precision nutrition strategies aimed at preventing or mitigating sarcopenia.",Han Y; Pack SP,International journal of molecular sciences,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40869189/,0,0,0,0,0,0

This study aimed to investigate the effect of selenium-enriched Lactobacillus coryniformis H8 (Se-H8) in alleviating lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced intestinal inflammation in chicks and the related mechanisms. 252 1-day-old White Leghorn chicks (n = 6 cages/treatment, 6 chicks/cage) were randomly divided into seven groups (Control, LPS, H8, Se-H8, H8-Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub>, and ENR). After 14 days of continuous gavage, a 3-day LPS intraperitoneal stress injection was performed. Serum, jejunum, and cecal faeces were collected for analysis of selenium levels, inflammatory factors, antioxidant status, gene expression, and microbial composition. Compared to the other treatment groups, Se-H8 exhibited the most pronounced alleviation of LPS-induced intestinal damage. This superior efficacy was reflected in significantly improved jejunal morphology, elevated serum selenium levels (P < 0.05), enhanced antioxidant capacity (increased GPX and SOD activities, decreased MDA levels; P < 0.05), and modulated inflammatory responses (reduced IL-1β and TNF-α, increased IL-10; P < 0.05). Furthermore, Se-H8 altered the expression of 23 selenoprotein genes in the jejunum and suppressed mRNA expression of key genes (TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-10) in the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway compared to the LPS group. Additionally, cecal microbiological analyses showed that Se-H8 increased the abundance of seven beneficial microorganisms, including Eubacterium_oxidoreducens_group, Eisenbergiella, Enorma, Catenibacillus, Merdibacter, Lachnospiraceae_FCS020_group, and GCA-900066575. In conclusion, Se-H8 alleviates LPS-induced jejunal injury by regulating antioxidant status, inflammation levels, selenoprotein genes expression, and gut microbial homeostasis. These findings highlight the potential of selenium-enriched microorganisms like Se-H8 as viable antibiotic alternatives for managing enteritis in poultry.",Xu ZJ; Xiao D; Chen K; Han JH; Zhu KD; Liu CM; Wang LS; Yu ZQ; Huang JQ,Poultry science,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40840291/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40855194,"Interplay of genetic predisposition, plasma metabolome and Mediterranean diet in dementia risk and cognitive function.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (AD/ADRD) have a substantial genetic basis, with APOE4 homozygotes increasingly recognized as a distinct genetic subtype. To identify genotype-specific metabolic pathways and modifiable risk factors, we integrated genetic, plasma metabolomic and dietary data from 4,215 women and 1,490 men in prospective cohorts. Here we show that the associations of 57 metabolites with dementia risk varied by APOE4 genotype or other AD/ADRD risk variants. For example, cholesteryl esters and sphingomyelins were most strongly associated with increased dementia risk in APOE4 homozygotes, whereas inverse associations with glycerides were specific to this genotype. Dimethylguanidino-valeric acid was more strongly associated with dementia risk among carriers of the rs2154481-C allele (APP). Adherence to the Mediterranean diet more effectively modulated dementia-related metabolites in APOE4 homozygotes, suggesting targeted prevention strategies. Incorporating metabolomic data modestly improved dementia risk prediction, particularly during early follow-up. Mendelian randomization analysis identified 19 putative causal relationships between metabolites and cognitive outcomes, including protective effects of 4-guanidinobutanoate, carotenoids and N<sup>6</sup>-carbamoylthreonyladenosine.

40840787,Novel genetic variants associated with stable isotope-based vitamin B<sub>12</sub> bioavailability measurements in healthy Indian adults.,"Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency is a prevalent health concern that can lead to hematological and neurological disorders. Despite adequate intake, vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency/insufficiency can arise due to interindividual differences in absorption and metabolism influenced by genetic factors, gastrointestinal health, and medications. Although previous studies have explored the genetic basis of circulating vitamin B<sub>12</sub> concentration, they have not been validated using precise, stable, isotope-based measurements of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> bioavailability. To measure the plasma bioavailability of an oral dose of [<sup>13</sup>C]-labeled vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (cyanocobalamin) using 2-compartment pharmacokinetic modeling and examine its associations with genetic variants in key genes involved in vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-related pathways. In a cohort of 104 young healthy Indian adults, functional vitamin B<sub>12</sub> markers including total vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and holotranscobalamin were measured using chemiluminescence immunoassays. Bioavailability was estimated by nonlinear mixed effects modeling of plasma vitamin B<sub>12</sub> time-concentration profiles using a modified 2-compartment model. Genetic associations were analyzed, and polygenic risk scores (PRSs) were computed. The mean measured vitamin B<sub>12</sub> bioavailability was 52% ± 16%, demonstrating significant 4.4-fold variability. A total of 85 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in/near 14 genes were significantly associated with vitamin B<sub>12</sub> bioavailability, including 5 previously reported SNPs associated with vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-related traits and 80 novel variants from known vitamin B<sub>12</sub> pathway genes. Bioavailability-PRS explained 72% (95% CI: 60%, 81%) of the variance in vitamin B<sub>12</sub> bioavailability in the same cohort and 55% in a 3-fold cross-validation test. At the first quartile threshold, the PRS identified individuals requiring supplementation with a positive predictive value of 0.32. These findings provide insights into the genetic determinants of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorption and homeostasis, emphasizing the potential of using genetic markers to personalize nutritional strategies. This is critical for identifying subgroups susceptible to vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency despite adequate intake, highlighting the need for precision nutrition led by functional measurements in specific populations.

40838083,ACE trial design: Equol targeting estrogen receptor-β in vascular and cognitive aging.,"Equol, a gut microbiome-derived metabolite of soy isoflavone daidzein, functions as a selective estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) agonist. In preclinical studies, it has demonstrated vascular protective and antioxidant effects, with emerging evidence suggesting potential neuroprotective properties. However, its role in preventing vascular aging and cognitive decline in humans remains unexplored. The Arterial Stiffness, Cognition, and Equol (ACE) trial investigates whether daily equol supplementation can slow the progression of arterial stiffness, brain white matter lesions, and cognitive decline in older adults without dementia. ACE is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted at the University of Pittsburgh, Wake Forest University, and Emory University. Community-dwelling adults aged 65 to 85 years without dementia were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to receive either 10 mg/day of equol or placebo for 24 months. The primary outcome is arterial stiffness assessed by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. Secondary outcomes include white matter lesions detected on the brain magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive function as assessed by the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite. Power calculations were based on a planned sample size of 400 participants, accounting for an anticipated 20% attrition rate. A total of 1783 individuals were pre-screened, and 764 underwent in-person eligibility assessment. Of these, 369 participants were randomized into two groups: Arm A (<i>n</i> = 185) and Arm B (<i>n</i> = 184). The randomized sample self-reported as 52% women and 22% Black/African American participants. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were well balanced between the two arms, indicating successful randomization. ACE successfully enrolled a racially diverse population of older adults and achieved near-target recruitment. ACE is the first large-scale trial to evaluate whether equol, a selective ERβ agonist, can impact vascular and cognitive aging, paving the way for precision nutrition strategies in dementia prevention. We detail the first randomized controlled trial of equol, an estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) agonist, for vascular and cognitive aging.The study tested equol's effects on arterial stiffness, white matter lesions, and cognition.The multisite trial enrolled 369 self-reported White and Black older adults aged 65 to 85 years.The trial investigated a novel dietary metabolite targeting ERβ pathways.",Sekikawa A; Wharton W; Murray-Krezan C; Wu M; Chang Y; Snitz BE; Coccari M; Yang S; Love ML; Cusick D; Wang R; Li M; Park C; Li J; DeConne TM; Smith C; Verble DD; Lancet MQ; Foroud T; Kim T; Nadkarni NK; Mettenburg JM; Zamora E; Lopez OL; Hughes TM,"Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N.

40830960,Metabolomics and nutrient intake reveal metabolite-nutrient interactions in metabolic syndrome: insights from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study.,"Despite advances in metabolomics, the complex relationship between metabolites and nutrient intake in metabolic syndrome (MetS) remains poorly understood in the Korean population. This study aimed to characterize the metabolomic profiles and nutrient intake associated with MetS and to examine their relationships in the Ansan-Ansung cohort of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES). Data from 2,306 middle-aged adults (1,109 men and 1,197 women) in the KoGES Ansan-Ansung cohort were analyzed. Plasma metabolites were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, identifying 135 metabolites. Nutrient intake was assessed using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire covering 23 nutrients. MetS-associated metabolites and nutrients were identified using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, logistic regression, partial least squares-discriminant analysis, and group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis. Pathway enrichment analysis identified key metabolic pathways, and fixed-effects models were applied to assess metabolite-nutrient relationships based on MetS status. Eleven metabolites, including hexose (FC = 0.95, P = 7.04 × 10<sup>-54</sup>), alanine, and branched-chain amino acids, and three nutrients including fat, retinol, and cholesterol, were significantly associated with MetS (FC range = 0.87-0.93; all P < 0.05). Pathway analysis highlighted disruptions in arginine biosynthesis and arginine-proline metabolism. The MetS group exhibited six unique metabolite-nutrient pairs that were not observed in the non-MetS group, including 'isoleucine-fat,' 'isoleucine-P,' 'proline-fat,' 'leucine-fat,' 'leucine-P,' and 'valerylcarnitine-niacin.' Notably, dysregulated metabolism of branched-chain amino acids, such as isoleucine and leucine, has been implicated in oxidative stress. Importantly, the stochastic gradient descent classifier achieved the best predictive performance among the eight machine learning models (area under the curve, AUC = 0.84), highlighting the robustness of classification based on metabolite data. However, the absence of external validation limits the generalizability of these findings. This comprehensive metabolomic analysis of the KoGES Ansan-Ansung cohort revealed distinct metabolic profiles and nutrient intake patterns associated with MetS, highlighting altered metabolite-nutrient relationships and disrupted metabolic pathways. These findings provide new insights into potential associations between metabolic phenotypes and dietary intake, which may help inform individualized dietary approaches related to MetS, such as branched-chain amino acids-restricted diets (valine, isoleucine, leucine), reduced intake of hexose-rich carbohydrates, and modulation of niacin-rich protein sources according to individual metabolic profiles.",Kim M; Lee S; Hur J; Shin D,Nutrition journal,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40830960/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40812477,"Patterns and Correlates of Concurrent Serum Vitamin D, Folate, and Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> Status in a Rural Chinese Population.","Vitamin D, folate, and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> are essential micronutrients with widespread insufficiencies globally. Although most previous research examined each of these nutrients individually, few studies have measured biomarkers of these nutrients concurrently in a large population. We aimed to investigate the patterns of concurrent insufficiencies or deficiencies of these nutrients based on serum biomarkers and influencing factors in a rural Chinese population. We analyzed the data from the nutrition biomarker substudy within the China Precision Nutrition and Health KAP Real World Study. Participants' nutrient status for vitamin D, folate, and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> was defined by serum biomarkers and grouped by the number of nutrients' insufficiency or deficiency (none, 1, 2, or all 3). Multiple logistic regression models identified factors associated with individual and combined nutrient insufficiencies or deficiencies. Of 40,716 participants (37.5% male), 99% had ≥ 1-nutrient insufficiency or deficiency, 53.4% had 2, and 31.7% had all 3. The prevalence of 3-nutrient insufficiency or deficiency was highest in males aged <65 y (35.4%) and lowest in females aged <65 y (28.4%). The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase TT genotype was associated with folate deficiency in both males and females. Current smoking was associated with folate deficiency and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> insufficiency in both sexes, with a more pronounced association observed in females. Additionally, higher body mass index was associated with vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency, particularly among males. In this large rural Chinese population, concurrent vitamin D, folate, and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> insufficiencies/deficiencies were highly prevalent and varied by individual demographic, genetic, and lifestyle factors.

Here, we describe the genotyping, imputation, and quality control (QC) procedures for the genetic data of trial participants. <b>Methods:</b> DNA was extracted from either whole blood or serum, and genotyping was performed using the Infinium Global Diversity Array. Established sample and SNP QC procedures were applied to the genotyping data, followed by imputation using the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 v5 reference panel. <b>Results:</b> Significant study-site, specimen type, and batch effects were observed. A total of 494 individuals of inferred European ancestry and 58 individuals of inferred African ancestry were included in the final imputed dataset. Evaluation of the imputed <i>APOE</i> genotype against gold-standard sequencing data showed high concordance (98.2%). We replicated several known genetic associations identified from previous genome-wide association studies, including SNPs previously linked to adiponectin (rs16861209, <i>p</i> = 1.5 × 10<sup>-5</sup>), alpha-linolenic acid (rs174547, <i>p</i> = 1.3 × 10<sup>-7</sup>), and alpha-tocopherol (rs964184, <i>p</i> = 0.003). <b>Conclusions:</b> This dataset represents the first genetic resource derived from a dietary intervention trial focused on cognitive outcomes. It enables investigation of genetic contributions to variability in cognitive response to the MIND diet and supports integrative analyses with other omics data types to elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying cognitive decline.

40790789,Personalized Genome-Scale Modeling Reveals Metabolic Perturbations in Fibroblasts of Methylmalonic Aciduria Patients.,"Cobalamin (vitamin B12) is an essential cofactor for two human enzymes, methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. Inborn errors of cobalamin metabolism (IECMs) are inherited genetic defects resulting in improper transport, modification, or utilization of cobalamin and include inherited methylmalonic acidurias, a group of IECMs most frequently caused by a defect in the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase enzyme. Here, we performed genome-scale modeling of IECMs to gain insight into their metabolic perturbations. First, we simulated deficiencies in 11 IECM-related genes and demonstrated that they cluster based on impaired metabolic pathways. Next, we leveraged RNA sequencing data from fibroblasts of 202 individuals with methylmalonic aciduria and 19 unaffected controls to construct and interrogate personalized metabolic models. Finally, we analyzed fluxes differing between patients depending on reported symptom presentation. Our findings reveal that (i) metabolic pathways including fatty acid metabolism and heme biosynthesis have reduced flux in IECMs, (ii) in personalized simulations, succinate and fumarate production and heme biosynthesis are impaired, especially in methylmalonyl-CoA mutase deficiency, (iii) one-carbon metabolism reactions such as serine hydroxymethyltransferase and folylglutamate synthase have reduced flux in all individuals with methylmalonic aciduria, and (iv) specific metabolic pathways are up- or down-regulated according to symptoms, including failure to thrive and hematological abnormalities, and treatments, such as antibiotics and protein restriction. Overall, our study delineates metabolic pathways perturbed in IECMs. In future applications, our modeling framework could be applied to other rare genetic diseases or used to predict personalized therapeutic or dietary interventions.",Heinken A; Awada H; Zanotelli VRT; Froese DS; Guéant-Rodriguez RM; Guéant JL,Journal of inherited metabolic disease,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40790789/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40737867,Precision nutrition for obesity management: A gut microbiota-centered weight-loss approach.,"Obesity is a complex and multifactorial condition strongly associated with metabolic burdens and cardiovascular diseases. This review focuses on precision nutrition as a strategy for obesity management, exploring how personalized interventions can modulate the composition and functionality of the gut microbiome to promote weight loss and improve metabolic health. A growing body of evidence suggests that imbalances in gut microbiota composition directly impact lipid metabolism, immune and inflammatory pathways, and appetite regulation mechanisms. Furthermore, the review discusses the relationship between gut microbiota and dietary factors, highlighting how certain types of diets (such as the Mediterranean diet and fiber-rich diets) can promote the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and the growth of beneficial bacteria associated with weight regulation and reduced inflammation. While diet is the primary factor modulating the gut microbiota, factors such as genetics and epigenetic characteristics, body composition, maternal nutritional, type of birth delivery, physical activity and even drug use also play significant roles in this modulation. Although the use of precision nutrition approaches still faces challenges, such as cost and variability in individual response, the integration of omics technologies, artificial intelligence, and machine learning appear to offer great potential as tools to identify specific microbial and genetic profiles that allow for the personalization of nutritional interventions. These technologies enable large-scale analysis of dietary, genomic, and microbial factors to create dietary strategies to prevent or treat obesity that meet the specific metabolic needs of each individual. Thus, the application of these tools in clinical settings could transform obesity management, creating data-driven interventions that enhance treatment effectiveness.",Carvalho LM; da Mota JCNL; Ribeiro AA; Carvalho BG; Martinez JA; Nicoletti CF,"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40737867/,1,0,0,0,0,0

40732941,Gut Microbiota in Women with Eating Disorders: A New Frontier in Pathophysiology and Treatment.,"Emerging evidence highlights the critical role of the gut microbiota in the development and progression of eating disorders (EDs), particularly in women, who are more frequently affected by these conditions. Women with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder exhibit distinct alterations in gut microbiota composition compared to healthy controls. These alterations, collectively termed dysbiosis, involve reduced microbial diversity and shifts in key bacterial populations responsible for regulating metabolism, inflammation, and gut-brain signaling. The gut microbiota is known to influence appetite regulation, mood, and stress responses-factors closely implicated in the pathogenesis of EDs. In women, hormonal fluctuations related to menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause may further modulate gut microbial profiles, potentially compounding vulnerabilities to disordered eating. Moreover, the restrictive eating patterns, purging behaviors, and altered dietary intake often observed in women with EDs exacerbate microbial imbalances, contributing to intestinal permeability, low-grade inflammation, and disturbances in neurotransmitter production. This evolving understanding suggests that microbiota-targeted therapies, such as probiotics, prebiotics, dietary modulation, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), could complement conventional psychological and pharmacological treatments in women with EDs. Furthermore, precision nutrition and personalized microbiome-based interventions tailored to an individual's microbial and metabolic profile offer promising avenues for improving treatment efficacy, even though these approaches remain exploratory and their clinical applicability has yet to be fully validated. Future research should focus on sex-specific microbial signatures, causal mechanisms, and microbiota-based interventions to enhance personalized treatment for women struggling with eating disorders.",Marano G; Rossi S; Sfratta G; Acanfora M; Anesini MB; Traversi G; Lisci FM; Rinaldi L; Pola R; Gasbarrini A; Sani G; Gaetani E; Mazza M,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40732941/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40732913,Genotype-Drug-Diet Interactions in Metabolic Regulation: CYP1A2 rs762551 Modulates the Effect of Caffeine on Lipid and Glucose Profiles in the Context of Pharmacotherapy.,"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Inter-individual metabolic responses to caffeine are shaped by CYP1A2 clearance rate and by concurrent lipid- or glucose-lowering drugs. We investigated how habitual caffeine intake relates to serum cholesterol and fasting glucose under different CYP1A2 rs762551 genotypes and statin or oral antidiabetic (OAD) use. <b>Methods</b>: A prospective cross-sectional analysis was performed on 358 adults (AA = 65, AC = 163, CC = 130) with recorded genotype, daily caffeine intake, total cholesterol, fasting glucose, and medication status. Multivariable linear regression tested the main and interaction effects of caffeine (mg day<sup>-1</sup>), genotype, and therapy. <b>Results:</b> Caffeine intake was positively associated with cholesterol levels (β = 0.30; <i>p</i> < 0.001). A significant genotype × caffeine interaction (β = 0.27; <i>p</i> < 0.001) revealed the steepest rise in fast metabolisers (AA) not on statins, an effect largely blunted by statin therapy. For glucose, the genotype × caffeine term was also significant (β = 0.30; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Among slow metabolisers (CC) without OADs, caffeine correlated positively with glycaemia (r = 0.34; <i>p</i> = 0.028), whereas in fast metabolisers on OADs the association reversed (r = -0.36; <i>p</i> = 0.015). No meaningful associations occurred in AC carriers. <b>Conclusions</b>: Caffeine's metabolic impact depends jointly on CYP1A2 genotype and medication. It raises cholesterol in fast metabolisers lacking statins and elevates glucose in slow metabolisers without OADs, yet may lower glucose when rapid metabolisation coincides with antidiabetic therapy. Accounting for this gene-diet-drug interplay could refine caffeine guidance within precision nutrition frameworks.",Popa LC; Abu-Awwad A; Farcas SS; Abu-Awwad SA; Andreescu NI,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40732913/,0,0,0,0,0,0

40714351,"Integrating biological age, epigenetic clocks, and telomere length in precision nutrition strategies for chronic disease management: Potential frameworks and ongoing challenges.","Precision nutrition is emerging as a transformative strategy for optimizing health, particularly in the context of biological aging and chronic disease prevention. This review aims to examine how biological age markers-specifically telomere length and epigenetic clocks-can be integrated into precision nutrition frameworks to personalize interventions, enhance chronic disease management, and support healthy aging. Telomere length is a widely studied biomarker of aging and chronic disease risk, while epigenetic clocks, based on DNA methylation patterns, offer complementary insights into biological age, gene expression, and disease susceptibility. Nutritional interventions rich in antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, polyphenols, B vitamins, and anti-inflammatory compounds have shown potential to modulate these biomarkers, supporting cellular health and delaying aging processes. In addition, lifestyle factors such as physical activity, stress management, and adequate sleep play critical roles in maintaining telomere integrity and epigenetic stability. However, challenges remain in translating these biomarkers into clinical practice. Importantly, variability is not the only barrier; most of these biomarkers still lack clinical validation, and there is no consensus on standardized protocols or reference values that would support their routine application in healthcare. Current guidelines recommend combining telomere length and epigenetic age with other molecular markers, such as multi-omics data, within integrative biological age assessment approaches. Nevertheless, translating this approach into clinical practice will require overcoming significant limitations, including the validation of biomarkers, standardization of measurement techniques, cost-effectiveness, and the development of clear clinical guidelines.

40707852,Precision nutrition in epigenetic aging: SHAP-optimized machine learning identifies omega-3 constituent-specific associations with aging biomarkers.,"This cross-sectional investigation seeks to examine the association between dietary omega-3 fatty acids (including α-linolenic acid [ALA], eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA], and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) and biomarkers of cellular aging, specifically DNA methylation age (Horvathage) and telomere length (Horvathtelo), in older adults. Our analysis leveraged nationally representative data from 2,136 participants aged ≥ 50 years in the 1999-2002 NHANES cycles. Multivariable linear regression models with survey weights were constructed to evaluate dose-response relationships, complemented by restricted cubic splines (RCS) for nonlinearity detection. Machine learning optimization included comparative evaluation of nine algorithms through five-fold cross-validation, with model interpretability enhanced via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. Higher omega-3 intake (Tertile 3 [T3] vs Tertile 1 [T1]) demonstrated inverse associations with HorvathAge (β = -1.07), particularly for ALA intake (T3 ≥ 1.512 g/d: β = -1.11). Contrastingly, moderate-to-high omega-3 intake (T2 ≥ 0.917 g/d: β = 0.04; T3: β = 0.04) and individual components (ALA_T3: β = 0.04; DHA_T3 ≥ 0.041 g/d: β = 0.05; EPA_T3 ≥ 0.011 g/d: β = 0.03) exhibited positive correlations with HorvathTelo. RCS modeling revealed distinct patterns: linear inverse correlation for HorvathAge versus nonlinear J-shaped association with Horvathtelo. Among ML models, Linear Support Vector Machines achieved superior predictive performance. SHAP feature importance analysis consistently ranked omega-3 composite measures highest, followed by constituent components (ALA > DHA > EPA). Our findings suggest a potential dual role of omega-3 in biological aging modulation: higher intake associates with decelerated epigenetic aging while maintaining telomere length homeostasis. These observations underscore the importance of considering both composite measures and individual components in nutritional gerontology research.",Yan Z; Xu Y; Peng T; Du X,Biogerontology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40707852/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40700711,Interactional Effects of Food Macronutrients with Gut Microbiome: Implications for Host Health and Risk.,"Macronutrients in the diet (e.g., carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids) that are rarely absorbed in the small intestine can typically traverse to the colon where they are metabolized by the gut microbiota to produce a spectrum of beneficial or detrimental metabolites. These gut-microbiota-dependent small-molecule metabolites are subsequently absorbed by the intestinal mucosa to participate in various physiological responses. Notably, succinate as a star dicarboxylic acid metabolite stemming from microbial fermentation of nondigestible carbohydrates regulates blood glucose homeostasis by promoting intestinal gluconeogenesis while inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, protein- or tryptophan-derived indole metabolites have emerged as a promising target for modulating neuropathic diseases. Fascinatingly, the linkage between gut microbiota and lncRNA <i>Snhg9</i> introduces a novel promising dimension for modulating lipid absorption, metabolism, and storage. Ongoing advancements in elucidating the interplay between macronutrients, gut microbiota, and host health may facilitate the development of gut microbiota-directed clinical precision nutrition strategies through intake of tailored macronutrients.",Tan Z; Yang C; Zhao Y; Yang X; Li T,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40700711/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40685952,Exploration of Biomarkers of Food Intake in a Caribbean Hispanic Population.,"Valid measures of dietary intake are essential for health and nutrition research, but typical forms- or interview-based measurements are susceptible to random and systematic errors. Although many biomarkers of food intake (BFIs) have been validated, we aimed to explore how food-BFI relationships are affected by genetic and lifestyle factors among Caribbean Hispanic adults. Dietary, clinical, anthropometric, blood metabolomics, and genotype data from 782 Puerto Rican adults were available. Thirty-one BFI-food intake relationships were assessed using linear regression, including covariates based on significant covariate-BFI associations (i.e., age, body weight, physical activity, and sex). We observed 12 known BFI-food pairs that reached statistical significance, of which 11 remained significant after adjustment. Applying genome-wide association tests of blood metabolites to BFI-food pairs, genetic variants rs7078243 and rs62501664 were identified as modifying relationships with 3-methylxanthine-coffee and 3-methylhistidine-poultry, respectively. Eleven validated biomarker-food intake pairs remained statistically significant after adjusting for covariates. Identification of genotype-BFI associations accentuates that the implementation of certain BFIs will depend on common genetic differences.",Parnell LD; Fouhy LE; Akinlawon O; Lai CQ; Nusetor F; Ordovás JM; Mangano KM; Tucker KL; Noel SE,Molecular nutrition & food research,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40685952/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40680045,Gene variations and sweet taste sensitivity in Zambian adults with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Sweet taste perception and preference play crucial roles in dietary habits and health outcomes. Understanding the genetic basis of taste thresholds and preferences can provide insights into individual differences in dietary behavior and susceptibility to metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In Zambia, there is paucity of data concerning taste perception and preference in relation to genetics among diabetic and non-diabetic individuals. This study aimed to determine the relationship between the genotype and sweet taste thresholds, among individuals with and without T2DM in Zambia. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 89 adults at Livingstone University Teaching Hospital (42 non-diabetic and 47 diabetics). Saliva samples were used to determine the TRPV1 rs4790522, and TAS1R3 rs307355 genotype. We assessed sweet taste threshold and preference using a series of aqueous sucrose solutions. Demographic characteristics, anthropometrics, lifestyle factors, and dietary habits were collected using a structured questionnaire. Sweet taste threshold positively correlated with preferred concentration in both groups (p < 0.05). A higher proportion of PwT2D with elevated preferred sweet concentrations carried one or both homozygous risk alleles (77.8%, TT/AA). When compared to healthy controls, PwT2D had higher BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and pulse rate. They also exhibited higher taste thresholds but lower preferred concentrations, though this group was significantly older, potentially confounding results. These findings suggest taste perception and genetic variation may differ in PwT2D, highlighting the need for further research in Sub-Saharan African populations to inform personalized, cost-effective treatment strategies. However, studies with a larger sample size are required to validate our findings.",Mwakyoma T; Graham CA; Hamooya BM; Muchaili L; Ngosa M; Povia JP; Pilic L; Masenga SK,PloS one,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40680045/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40645333,A genotype-guided nutritional intervention to reduce cardiometabolic risk factors in young adults: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"Cardiometabolic diseases (CMD), including cardiovascular disease, obesity and diabetes, are major public health challenges influenced by lifestyle factors (e.g., diet), vitamin D status, and genetic predisposition. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) contribute to genetic risk scores for CMD-related traits (M-GRS) and recent research suggests that genotype-based nutritional interventions have the potential to reduce these risks. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of genotype-guided nutritional interventions versus standard dietary recommendations in young adults. This 12-month study includes a 6-month intervention phase and a 6-month free-living phase. Data will be collected at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. We plan to recruit young adults (aged 23-29) previously genotyped from the Obesity, Lifestyle, and Diabetes in Brazil (BOLD) study and randomized by BMI, sex, and M-GRS based on 34 SNPs. The control group will follow a standard Brazilian diet with CMD-related recommendations and 1000 IU of vitamin D3 daily. The personalized intervention group will receive a genotype-guided dietary plan based on gene-diet interactions for SNPs in the M-GRS, along with personalized vitamin D3 supplementation (1000 or 4000 IU) based on their genetic risk for deficiency (D-GRS). Body composition, biochemical markers and metabolomics will be assessed, with the reduction in body fat percentage as the primary outcome. This study will contribute to precision nutrition by assessing genotype-guided dietary recommendations for CMD risk management, potentially demonstrating how genetic information can optimize dietary interventions and reduce CMD burdens, improving overall health outcomes.

40643953,Vitamin K2 reprograms the multi-organ transcriptional landscape in mice with high-fat diet-induced obesity.,"Vitamin K2 (VK2) shows promise as a nutritional intervention for obesity-related disorders, but its mechanisms of action in obesity and associated phenotypes are not yet fully understood. This study aims to elucidate the rescue effects of VK2 on multiple tissues during obesity. Twenty-eight 8-week-old male C57BL6/N mice are divided into four groups and fed a high-fat diet or normal diet for 16 weeks, receiving either menaquinone-7 (MK-7) or soybean oil solvent <i>via</i> gavage. RNA sequencing of brain, colon, muscle, heart, kidney, and liver tissues constructed a multi-organ transcriptional profile. The ""rescue differentially expressed genes (DEGs)"" are identified and tissue-tissue communication is analyzed. VK2 improves the biochemical profile in high-fat diet-induced obesity. Following VK2 intervention, the brain and kidneys exhibit more changes in autophagy, neurodegenerative diseases, energy metabolism, and immune response pathways. VK2 rescues over 10% of abnormally expressed genes, with most being fully restored. These rescue genes exhibit tissue-specific biological effects, including neuropeptide signaling and neuron ensheathment in the brain; triglyceride metabolism and carboxylic acid catabolism in the colon; microvillus organization and vascular permeability regulation in the heart; regulation of immune processes and collagen biosynthesis in the kidney; transforming growth factor-beta receptor signaling, iron transport and homeostasis in the liver; and muscle contraction, ATP transport, and filament sliding in the muscle. VK2 eliminates elevated ligand-receptor signals in immune response pathways and promotes the tissue-tissue signaling network to approach healthy control levels. VK2 significantly rescues the multi-organ transcriptome and restores tissue-specific pathways in high-fat diet-induced obese mice, providing the molecular mechanisms countering metabolic disorders.",Wang X; Zhang Y; Liu L; Ma H; Wei C; Xu X; Zhang J; Pan S; Zhang Y; Chen J; Duan L; Geng G; Dang K; Xie H; Wang G; Li L; Li R; Li Y,Food & function,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40643953/,0,0,0,0,0,0

This study aimed to enhance its utility by preparing water-soluble oxidized EP (OEP) using a 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical (TEMPO)-mediated oxidation process. When compared with EP, OEP was found to boost glucose intake in insulin-resistant cells while increasing insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) levels. OEP effectively reduced fasting blood glucose levels in diabetic mice from 13.41 to 8.86 mmol L<sup>-1</sup>. OEP protected the liver from damage by enhancing hepatic glucose absorption through modulation of the IRS1/GLUT4 signaling pathway. OEP adjusted hepatic lipid composition, reducing the accumulation of diglycerides and triglycerides, ultimately ameliorating diabetes. Therefore, the OEP demonstrates significant potential as a nutritional substance for regulating blood glucose levels.",Li H; Wu S; Ma J; Wang K; Tan M; Wang H,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40619873/,0,0,0,0,0,0

We investigated gut microbiome compositional patterns in healthy Koreans (n = 890), identifying six clusters (I-VI) with unique compositions and host preferences. Each cluster had a distinct topological structure within the microbial interaction network, underscoring its diverse roles in maintaining microbial communities. Cluster II, predominated by Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium, was consistently found across individuals and centrally located within the microbial interaction network. Cluster III, mainly composed of Oscillospira and Coprococcus, and IV, dominated by Enterobacteriaceae and Bacteroides fragilis, demonstrated mutually exclusive relationships, reflecting affinities for host clusters with varied dietary patterns and microbial diversity. Clusters V and VI linked different microbial clusters, and cluster I had separate subcommunities.

40589935,A Scoping Review of Epigenetic Signatures of Diet and Diet-related Metabolites: Insights from Epigenome-Wide Association Studies and Their Implications for Cardiometabolic Health and Diseases.,"Epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) have emerged as a powerful approach to investigate how dietary exposures shape the epigenome and subsequently influence metabolic and cardiovascular health. A growing number of EWAS have examined the effects of various dietary factors, including overall dietary patterns, specific food groups, micronutrients, and food-related metabolites, on DNA methylation (DNAm) across diverse populations. In this review, we map the landscape of nutritional EWAS, identifying the types of dietary exposures studied, the genomic regions where epigenetic signals emerge, and overarching trends across studies. Across studies, consistent associations were reported at nine CpG sites in genes such as <i>AHRR</i>, <i>CPT1A</i>, and <i>FADS2</i>, particularly in relation to fatty acid consumption, and certain diet patterns. Biological pathways enriched included fatty acid metabolism and the PPAR signaling pathway. In conclusion, our review identified a pattern of epigenetic convergence that may underlie diet-related disease risk. While promising, key knowledge gaps were also noted, including limited longitudinal follow-up, unclear causal pathways, and underrepresentation of ethnic diversity. Moving forward, we highlighted several complementary approaches for translating nutritional EWAS findings into actionable public health and precision nutrition strategies, including integrating multi-omics, mediation analyses, and population-wide epigenetic risk profiling.",Asif R; Liu R; de Souza RJ; Azab S; Chong M; Anand SS; Deng WQ,The Yale journal of biology and medicine,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40589935/,0,0,0,0,0,1
40586597,A three-country analysis of the gut microbiome indicates taxon associations with diet vary by taxon resolution and population.,"Emerging research suggests that diet plays a vital role in shaping the composition and function of the gut microbiota. Although substantial efforts have been made to identify general patterns linking diet to the gut microbiome, much of this research has been concentrated on a small number of countries. Additionally, both diet and the gut microbiome have highly complex and individualized configurations, and there is growing evidence that tailoring diets to individual gut microbiota profiles may optimize the path toward improving or maintaining health and preventing disease. Using fecal metagenomic data from 1,177 individuals across three countries, we examine the relationship between diet and bacterial genera, focusing on <i>Prevotella</i> and <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, which have gained significant attention for their potential roles in human health and strong associations with dietary patterns. We find that these two genera in particular show significant associations with many aspects of diet but these associations vary in scale and direction, depending on the level of metagenomic resolution (i.e., genus level by reads and strain level by metagenome-assembled genomes) and the contextual population. These results highlight the growing importance of building metagenomic data sets that are standardized, comprehensive, and representative of diverse populations to increase our ability to tease apart the complex relationship between diet and the microbiome. An analysis of fecal microbiome data from individuals in the United States, United Kingdom, and Mexico shows that associations with dietary components vary both by country and by level of resolution (i.e., genus and strain).

40521668,Mesenchymal SLMAP coordinates with MST3 to govern gut elongation during development.,"Developing gut in mice undergoes rapid elongation during late embryogenesis, yet significantly slows down after birth. The precise regulatory mechanism of this dynamic morphogenetic process remains unknown. By utilizing single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis, we show that YAP activity in intestinal fibroblasts is the major molecular contributor to gut elongation. To determine how mesenchymal YAP activity is controlled, we identified canonical sarcolemma membrane-associated protein (SLMAP) as its critical regulator during mouse embryonic gut morphogenesis. Deleting Slmap in gut mesenchyme impairs YAP activity, leading to a short gut and a significant decrease in intestinal epithelial cell proliferation. Mechanistically, SLMAP activates YAP by directly regulating MST3 kinase. Physiologically, MST3 levels prominently increase over the developmental time, reaching their peak on postnatal day (P)14, when gut elongation in mice slows down. Depleting Mst3 in mesenchyme results in increased gut length at P14 accompanied by enhanced YAP activity. Importantly, a short gut phenotype in mesenchyme-specific Slmap mutant mice is partially compensated for by concomitant deletion of mesenchymal Mst3. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that SLMAP interacts with MST3 kinase to regulate the mesenchymal YAP activity that governs dynamic gut elongation across embryonic and postnatal development.",Pan Y; Wang S; Yang W; Wu X; Zhang H; Du S; Zhang M; Hou L; Plikus MV; Shuai J; Lv C; Yu L; Yu Z,"Development (Cambridge, England)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40521668/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40517091,Integrating genetics and lifestyles for precision nutrition in hypertriglyceridemia: A UK Biobank and KoGES analysis.,"Hypertriglyceridemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. This study examined the polygenic variants associated with high serum triglyceride concentration (high-TG) and their interactions with lifestyle factors using data from the UK Biobank (n = 479,300) and the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES; n = 57,939). High-TG group was categorized based on over 200 mg/dL fasting serum TG concentrations (Caucasians, UK Biobank, n = 100,543; Koreans, KoGES, n = 7211). Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were calculated using risk alleles from genetic variants identified through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) analyses. Koreans showed higher frequencies of risk alleles in GCKR, APOA5, SIK3, and APOE genes compared to Caucasians. After adjusting for covariates, a PRS including lipoprotein lipase (LPL)_rs328, apolipoprotein A5 (APOA5)_rs2072560, and glucokinase regulator (GCKR)_rs780093 showed a 2.2-fold (UK Biobank) and 2.6-fold (KoGES) increased risk of high-TG among Caucasians and Koreans, respectively. In both cohorts, the PRS was positively associated with metabolic syndrome, serum low high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol concentrations, but inversely associated with high-TG. These variants were linked to the chylomicron and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) remodeling pathways in Multimarker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation (MAGMA) gene analysis. Significant interactions were observed between the PRS and lifestyle factors, namely plant-based diet (P = .0008), alcohol consumption (P = .0022), and smoking status (P < .001) in both cohorts. Additionally, in the KoGES cohort, vitamin D intake (P = .027) and the glycemic index (P = .045) interacted with the PRS to influence high-TG risk. Similar genetic variants affected high-TG risk across populations despite ethnic differences in risk allele frequencies. The identified PRS significantly interacted with plant-based diet, alcohol consumption, and smoking status in both cohorts, with additional interactions observed with vitamin D intake and glycemic index in the Korean cohort.",Hur HJ; Yang HJ; Kim MJ; Jang HJ; Kim MS; Park S,Journal of clinical lipidology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40517091/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40516614,Exploring genetic modifiers influencing adult eating behaviour: A scoping review.,"Disruptive eating behaviors can negatively impact psychological well-being and increase the risk of metabolic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. While behavioral strategies remain central to dietary interventions, emerging research highlights genetic factors, particularly single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as contributors to individual differences in eating behaviors. This scoping review maps existing research on genetic modifiers of adult eating behaviors, identifying key variants and genetic predispositions. An extensive systematic search was conducted across 12 electronic databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, alongside relevant grey literature. Sixty-five studies published from 2014 to April 2024 met inclusion criteria. Data were synthesized using Covidence and NVivo for thematic mapping. Studies were eligible if they utilized genotyping to examine genetic markers, variations, or SNPs in relation to adult eating behaviors using validated questionnaires and/or dietary interventions. Six key themes emerged: taste perception; appetite and satiety; emotional eating; disinhibition; food timing and eating habits; and snacking, craving and binge eating. Frequently studied genes included CD36, MC4R, FTO, TAS1R, TAS2R, SLC4A5, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, DRD2, CLOCK, ADIPOQ and CA6, with some studies incorporating genetic risk scores. Across reviewed studies, there was a female predominance (female-to-male ratio of 1.6:1), while older adults were underrepresented (mean age: 35.2 ± 8.4 years). Cross-sectional study designs (58 %), highlighted a methodological gap, underscoring the need for longitudinal research to explore causality.

40507144,In Search of Healthy Ageing: A Microbiome-Based Precision Nutrition Approach for Type 2 Diabetes Prevention.,"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and in Spain, particularly in the elderly population, affecting healthy ageing. Nutritional strategies are key to its prevention. The gut microbiota is also implicated in T2D and can be modulated by nutrition. We hypothesize that precision nutrition through microbiota modulation may help prevent T2D. This article aims to (1) describe a gut microbiota bacterial profile associated with T2D prevention, (2) provide precision nutrition tools to optimize this profile, (3) analyze how overweight influences the microbiota composition and precision nutrition response, and (4) address the technical challenges of microbiome-based precision nutrition clinical implementation to prevent T2D. <b>Methods</b>: A review of gut microbiota associated with T2D prevention was conducted. 13 healthy Spanish participants over 62 with optimal blood glucose levels (7 normal weight and 6 overweight) underwent a 3-month precision nutrition intervention to optimize T2D-preventive gut microbiota using a bioinformatics food recommendation system, Phymofood (EP22382095). Fecal microbiota was analyzed pre- and post-intervention using full-length 16S rRNA gene amplification, MinION sequencing, and NCBI taxonomic classification. <b>Results</b>: 31 potentially preventive bacteria against T2D were selected. The intervention increased the relative abundance of beneficial genera (<i>Butyrivibrio</i> and <i>Faecalibacterium</i>) and species (<i>Eshraghiella crossota</i>, and <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i>). The overweight influenced microbiota composition and intervention response. <b>Conclusions</b>: A gut microbiota profile associated with T2D prevention was identified, and precision nutrition could increase the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria. Confounding factors such as overweight should be considered when designing microbiome-based precision nutrition interventions.

40504085,"Innovations in Quail Welfare: Integrating Environmental Enrichment, Nutrition and Genetic Advances for Improved Health and Productivity.","The demand for ethical and sustainable poultry production is driving up the importance of quail welfare. Because quail meat and eggs are in high demand, quails are frequently kept in harsh production environments that may harm their health and well-being. This review examines contemporary developments that combine enhanced nutrition, environmental enrichment and genetic improvements to improve quail well-being. By concentrating on these essential elements, we offer a thorough synopsis of tactics that can improve the welfare and productivity of quails in industrial environments. Enhancing the environment for quail has shown to be a successful strategy. It has been demonstrated that adding naturalistic elements, such as perches, materials for dust bathing and different lighting, reduces stress, promotes natural behaviours and enhances general health. We analysed the influence of innovative feeding on immunity, gastrointestinal health and stress resilience, emphasising the importance of personalised nutritional interventions in welfare improvement. Additionally, there are encouraging prospects to improve quail welfare thanks to genetic developments. Results are starting to emerge from selective breeding initiatives designed to increase stress tolerance, disease resistance and environmental adaptation. The potential of genetics and biotechnology in developing quail strains that are resilient to welfare challenges and highly productive is covered in this review. This review highlights the potential of integrating environmental enrichment, precision nutrition and genetic innovations to enhance quail welfare in intensive systems.

This study investigated the effect of cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R) in ASD with pharmacological, genetic and brain-targeted intervention and the underlying mechanisms. Results showed that blocking CB1R counteracted the beneficial effects of boosting 2-AG or AEA on ASD-like behaviors in valproic acid (VPA)-exposed mice. Besides, CB1R knockout mice exhibited ASD-like behaviors and synaptic deficits. In CB1R-specific brain-targeted regulation, activating CB1R ameliorated synaptic dysfunction, including neuronal complexity, spine density, dendritic integrity, synaptic protein expression, and neuronal damage. Moreover, activating CB1R enhanced the expression and current density of Kir4.1, indicating that CB1R may influence synaptic activity by modulating Kir4.1. Collectively, our findings indicated a critical role for CB1R in the improvement of ASD-like behavior and synaptic dysfunction, which may offer promising avenues for developing effective treatments for ASD.",Wang F; Liu Z; Hu J; Cheng Z; Liu S; Tian W; Zhang Y; Yang L; Liu T; Sun C; Zou M,Life sciences,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40484367/,0,0,0,0,0,0

40444793,Balancing harm and harmony: Evolutionary dynamics between gut microbiota-derived flagellin and TLR5-mediated host immunity and metabolism.,"The gut microbiota maintains host health and shapes immune responses through intricate host-microbe interactions. Bacterial flagellin, a key microbe-associated molecular pattern, is recognized by Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) and NOD-like receptor family caspase activation and recruitment domain-containing 4 inflammasome. This dual recognition maintains the delicate balance between immune tolerance and activation, thereby influencing health and disease outcomes. Therefore, we explored the structural and functional evolution of bacterial flagellin to elucidate its role in innate and adaptive immune responses, along with its impact on metabolic processes, particularly via TLR5. In this review, we highlight the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of flagellin, including its application in vaccine development, cancer immunotherapy, and microbiome-based therapies. We integrated perspectives from structural biology, immunology, and microbiome research to elucidate the co-evolutionary dynamics between gut microbiota-derived flagellin and host immunity. Our interpretations provide a basis for the development of innovative strategies to improve health and disease management.",Seo B; Lim MY,Virulence,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40444793/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40435618,Exosome encapsulated miRNA let-7d-3p mediated Zearalenone-induced hepatotoxicity with Arid5a/STAT3 signaling pathway.,"Zearalenone (ZEA) is a fungal toxin that is commonly found in grains and feeds. It has been demonstrated that this toxin can induce oxidative stress and inflammation, which can result in liver damage in humans and animals. Exosomes have the capacity to carry active substances, and when these particles are released into the blood, they can transport these substances to other cells, thereby affecting the health of the body. However, the specific mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. This study was conducted with the objective of investigating the exosome-mediated liver injury of ZEA in rats and its possible mechanism. Firstly, the systemic toxic effects of ZEA exposure were clarified at the animal level. It was found that ZEA induced an elevation in the levels of exosome in the serum of rats. Subsequent analysis determined that the main source of exosomes were the liver. Secondly, transcriptomics was used to screen out the microRNAs (miRNA) let-7d-3p in exosomes, which may mediate the liver damage induced by ZEA. Furthermore the mechanism of exosomes and miRNA let-7d-3p involved in the hepatotoxicity induced by ZEA was explored. Compared with database, we clarified that ZEA caused liver damage through the let-7d-3p/Arid5a signaling pathway. This study revealed the role of exosomes on intercellular communication in ZEA hepatotoxicity, providing a new perspective for ZEA toxicity and its prevention and control.",Xu T; Huangfu B; Chen Y; Ban Q; Zhang F; Huang K; Liang Z; He X,Journal of hazardous materials,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40435618/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40431452,Sweet Taste Receptors' Genetic Variability in Advanced Potential Targets of Obesity.,"<i>Background</i>: Obesity, mainly visceral obesity, causes a low-grade of chronic inflammation (meta-inflammation), associated with comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and certain cancers. Precision Nutrition aims to understand the bidirectional crosstalk between the genome and diet to improve human health. Additionally, by leveraging individual data, Precision Nutrition seeks to predict how people will respond to specific foods or dietary patterns, with the ultimate goal of providing personalized nutritional recommendations tailored to their unique needs and lifestyle factors, including poor dietary habits (e.g., high intake of sugar or saturated fatty acids, alcohol consumption, etc.) and sedentary habits, exacerbate obesity in genetically predisposed individuals. Genetic, metabolic, and environmental factors can play a crucial role during obesity. <i>Objective</i>: To investigate the effects of genetic variability in sweet taste receptors and their downstream signaling pathways in the gut-brain axis on anthropometry, biochemistry, and lifestyle variables. <i>Methods</i>: A sample of 676 volunteers (mean age of 42.22 ± 12 years, ranging from 18 to 73 years) from the database of the GENYAL platform for nutritional trials at the IMDEA Food Institute were included in this study. We present a first-in-class genetic chip, Glucosensing, designed to interrogate 25 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in genes encoding sweet taste receptors and components of downstream signaling pathways. These include elements of the gut-brain axis and its associated metabolic networks, enabling a comprehensive analysis of individual variability in sweet taste perception and metabolic responses. <i>Results</i>: Several significant associations were found after correction for multiple comparisons, representing potential targets for personalized interventions.",Wagner-Reguero S; Fernández LP; Colmenarejo G; Cruz-Gil S; Espinosa I; Molina S; Crespo MC; Aguilar-Aguilar E; Marcos-Pasero H; de la Iglesia R; Loria-Kohen V; Ruiz RR; Laparra-Llopis M; de Molina AR; Gómez de Cedrón M,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40431452/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40428319,Interaction Between Dietary Fiber Intake and <i>MTNR1B</i> rs10830963 Polymorphism on Glycemic Profiles in Young Brazilian Adults.,"The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs10830963 in the melatonin receptor 1B (<i>MTNR1B</i>) gene influences insulin secretion and glucose metabolism and has been associated with an increased risk of type-2 diabetes. This study aimed to explore the interaction between dietary intake and the <i>MTNR1B</i> rs10830963 polymorphism on glycemic profiles in young Brazilian adults. This cross-sectional study assessed 200 healthy young adults (19-24 years), evaluating the <i>MTNR1B</i> rs10830963 genotype, anthropometric parameters, glycemic markers (fasting insulin, glucose, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-β), and dietary intake via three 24 h dietary recalls. Genotype-diet interactions were tested using multivariate linear regression models adjusted for confounders. The carriers of the G allele exhibited a positive association with fasting insulin levels (<i>p</i> = 0.003), insulin/glucose ratio (<i>p</i> = 0.004), HOMA-IR (<i>p</i> = 0.003), and HOMA-β (<i>p</i> = 0.018). Energy-adjusted fiber intake showed a significant genotype-specific interaction only in carriers of the G allele, where higher dietary fiber intake was significantly associated with lower fasting insulin (<i>p<sub>interaction</sub></i> = 0.034) and HOMA-IR (<i>p<sub>interaction</sub></i> = 0.028). Our findings indicate that the <i>MTNR1B</i> rs10830963 polymorphism is associated with glycemic markers, and dietary fiber intake may attenuate the adverse effects of the <i>MTNR1B</i> rs10830963 G allele on glycemic profiles in young Brazilian adults. This highlights the potential role of fiber in improving health outcomes for individuals carrying this risk allele. To validate these results and assess the broader implications for the Brazilian population, further intervention studies and larger-scale research are essential.",Lima ACDS; Cruvinel NT; Silva NRD; Mendes MM; Duarte ACS; Coelho ASG; Vimaleswaran KS; Horst MA,Genes,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40428319/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40410146,The health impacts and genetic architecture of food liking in cardio-metabolic diseases.,"We evaluated temporal and genetic relationships between 176 food-liking-traits and cardio-metabolic diseases using data from the UK Biobank (N = 182,087) for observational analyses and summary-level GWAS data from FinnGen and other consortia (N = 406,565-977,323) for genetic analyses. Integrating observational and genetic results, we identified two detrimental food-liking-traits (bacon and diet-fizzy-drinks) and three protective food-liking-traits (broccoli, pizza, and lentils/beans). These food-liking-traits are associated with habitual food intake and influence cardio-metabolic proteins and biological processes. Notably, we found three genetic links: diet-fizzy-drinks with heart-failure, bacon with type-2-diabetes, and lentils/beans with type-2-diabetes, identifying 54 pleiotropic single-nucleotide-variants, impacting both phenotypes. Our data show the diet-fizzy-drinks and heart-failure link maybe not direct, as diet-fizzy-drinks liking correlates with sweet food consumption and shares variants linked to BMI, adiposity, platelet count and cardio-metabolic traits. The pleiotropic single-nucleotide-variants map to 251 tissue-specific genes, with four showing high druggability potential, highlighting personalized dietary strategies for cardio-metabolic diseases.",Jiang W; Wang H; Geng Y; Guo M; Zuo Y; Han S; Liu Z; Chen S; Fan S; Li S; Qiao C; Li Q; Li B; Zhang Y; Wei W; Han T,Nature communications,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40410146/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40372036,"Identification of 1,400 metabolites as mediators of obesity in 473 gut microbiota taxa: a mediation Mendelian randomization study.","Obesity is a global health problem driven by genetic, endocrine, and environmental factors. Gut microbiota significantly influences obesity, yet causal relationships and underlying pathways remain elusive. The objective of the study was to investigate causal relationships between gut microbiota, metabolites, and obesity; elucidate potential pathways mediating obesity onset; identify novel genes; and explore the impact of plasma proteins on obesity risk. Bidirectional and two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) were used to explore causal relationships. Mediation analyses identified mechanisms linking gut microbiota, metabolites, and obesity. Pathway analyses and protein-protein interaction assessed genetic and protein associations. The MR analysis results identified 11 gut microbiota species with causal associations with obesity, 69 metabolites that were significantly causally related to obesity, and seven bacteria with causal relationships, mediated by metabolites. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)-related gene set enrichment analysis revealed clustering in a concentration of genes enriched for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB/AKT) and plasma membrane-related signaling pathways. Fms-related receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT1), growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), and SLIT and NTRK-like family member 1 (SLITRK1) plasma proteins had protective effects against obesity. This study revealed causal links between gut bacteria, metabolites, and obesity, and identified potential therapeutic targets. Findings deepen understanding of obesity's complex mechanisms and suggest novel prevention and treatment strategies, emphasizing the gut microbiota and treatment targets. This study pioneered the use of genetic approaches and mediator analyses to confirm the causal relationship between gut microbiota, metabolites, and obesity, and also explored how these factors work together to promote obesity through specific signaling pathways and protein interactions. This finding provides a theoretical basis and potential targets for precision medicine strategies against obesity, which is of great clinical significance. In addition, the identification of protective plasma proteins as biomarkers for obesity prevention opens up new avenues for tailoring obesity intervention strategies.",Li X; Wu Q; Liu S-p,Microbiology spectrum,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40372036/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40369689,Milk phospholipid-coated lipid droplets modulate the infant gut microbiota and metabolome influencing weight gain.,"The supramolecular structure and composition of milk fat globules in breast milk is complex. Lipid droplets in formula milk are typically smaller compared to human milk and differ in their lipid and protein composition. These droplets play an important role in gut and immune maturation, and their components possess antimicrobial and antiviral properties. Here, the influence of a concept infant formula (IF) containing large milk phospholipid-coated lipid droplets on the maturation of the infant microbiota, metabolome, and weight gain in the first year of life was investigated. Formula-fed infants were randomized to receive either a standard IF (Control) or a Test formula containing large milk phospholipid-coated lipid droplets (Test) until 17 weeks of age. A breast-fed Reference group was also investigated. At 3 months of age, several taxa identified as opportunistic pathogens (e.g., Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Streptococcus) were less abundant in the Test stools compared to Control, while an enrichment of the butyrate-producing Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae was observed. These findings indicate that the Test formula resulted in gut microbiota maturation trajectories more comparable to healthy breast-fed infants. This was accompanied by variation in several fecal and plasma metabolites at 3 months of age related to gut microbial metabolism including bile acids, hippurate, phenylacetylglycine, trimethylamine, and various lipids and fatty acids. At 12 months, measures of subcutaneous fat and body mass index (BMI) were significantly higher in infants receiving standard IF compared to those receiving breast milk. However, this weight gain and adiposity was attenuated in the Test group infants. The presence of large phospholipid-coated lipid droplets in formula milk positively influenced the development of the infants' gut microbiota, their metabolomic profiles, and their body composition to more closely resemble breast-fed infants compared to standard IF. These droplets may further enhance the restriction of pathogenic bacteria seen with standard infant formula and suggest a potential impact on infant metabolic programming that may contribute to physiological development.

The development of highly sensitive, rapid and on-site method for S. typhimurium analysis is urgently needed to prevent bacterial infections. Herein, we introduced a CRISPR/Cas12a-driven electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensor based on luminol/O<sub>2</sub> binary systems for S. typhimurium detection, employing ultrafine Pt nanoclusters-anchored 2D delaminated-MXenes (Pt NCs/D-MXenes) as the co-reactant accelerator. The ultrathin D-MXenes support regulates the size and dispersibility of Pt NCs and facilitates the full exposure of active sites, and synergistic interactions between D-MXenes and Pt NCs improves electrocatalytic properties toward the reduction of O<sub>2</sub>, which promotes the generation of ROS for boosting ECL emission.

However, the design and application of whole-cell biosensing systems are limited by the unsatisfactory performance of the core sensing element ─ transcription factors. This paper proposed the development of artificial riboswitches for heavy metal identification based on their high sensitivity, specificity, and ease of modification, which can be used alone or combination with transcription factors to construct more efficient whole-cell biosensors. This article summarized the reported aptamers targeting heavy metals in the last 20 years, and presented methods for screening intracellularly folding aptamers and strategies for constructing and optimizing the performance of artificial riboswitches using these aptamers. Heavy-metal-induced artificial riboswitches can be used in multiple applications, significantly enhancing the design potential of whole-cell sensing systems. Artificial riboswitches can be considered as another ""engine,"" alongside transcription factors, to drive the development and innovation of whole-cell sensing systems.",Xia S; Du Z; Su H; Hu L; Zheng J; Wang R; Guo M; Zhu L; Xu W; Ren F,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40331411/,1,0,0,0,0,0

This is a secondary analysis of the Diet Intervention Examining The Factors Interacting with Treatment Success (DIETFITS) study, a 12-month randomized clinical trial of HLC or HLF diets in 609 adults aged 18 to 50 years with BMI values between 28 and 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The current study examined 3-, 6-, and 12-month weight loss in participants with different APOA2 genotypes (TT vs. C allele carriers, CT + CC) at variant rs5082 who met the SAT intake criterion of ≥22 g/day for an HLC diet and < 22 g/day for an HLF diet at all three study time points. Participants with the TT APOA2 genotype lost significantly more weight consistently on an HLC diet than on an HLF diet at 3, 6, and 12 months, whereas C allele carriers lost more weight only at 3 months and not at 6 or 12 months. APOA2 genotype-by-SAT intake interaction affecting weight loss was observed only at 12 months. Among participants who did not consistently meet the SAT intake criterion, there were no significant weight-loss differences among APOA2 genotypes. This study highlights the importance of evaluating genotype-diet interactions in weight-loss trials to better inform precision nutrition interventions.

40307513,Precision nutrition for cardiometabolic diseases.,"Precision nutrition is a vibrant and rapidly evolving field of scientific research and innovation with the potential to deliver health, societal and economic benefits by improving healthcare delivery and policies. Advances in deep phenotyping technologies, digital tools and artificial intelligence have made possible early proof-of-concept research that expands the understanding of within- and between-person variability in responses to diet. These studies illustrate the promise of precision nutrition to complement the traditional 'one size fits all' dietary guidelines, which, while considering broad life-stage and disease-specific nutritional requirements, often lack the granularity to account fully for individual variations in nutritional needs and dietary responses.

40305967,Later eating timing in relation to an individual internal clock is associated with lower insulin sensitivity and affected by genetic factors.,"Although the contribution of the circadian clock to metabolic regulation is widely recognized, the role of eating timing in glucose metabolism and diabetes risk remains insufficiently studied. This study aimed (i) to investigate the link between the eating timing pattern relative to individual clock and glucose homoeostasis and (ii) to explore the contribution of genetic and environmental factors to eating timing parameters. In 92 adult twins (NCT01631123), glycaemic traits were assessed using the oral glucose tolerance test. Parameters of eating timing pattern (eating timing itself, daily calorie distribution, and eating frequency) were extracted from five-day food records. Caloric midpoint defined as the time point at which 50% of daily calories are consumed. Circadian timing of eating was determined as a time interval between the clock time of eating and a corrected midpoint of sleep, a chronotype marker. Heritability of eating timing components was estimated by comparing correlations within monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs and fitting genetic structural equation models. Among components of eating timing, the most associations were found for the circadian time of caloric midpoint (CCM). Later CCM was significantly associated with poorer insulin sensitivity, i.e. with lower ISI Stumvoll (β = 0.304, p = 5.9 × 10<sup>-4</sup>) and higher HOMA-IR (β = -0.258, p = 0.011) indices, as well as with higher fasting insulin levels (β = -0.259, p = 0.013), even after the model adjustment for sex, age, daily energy intake, and sleep duration. Later CCM also demonstrated robust associations with higher BMI and waist circumference. All eating timing components showed high or moderate heritability and were strongly related to individual sleep timing. Later eating timing in relation to an individual internal clock is associated with lower insulin sensitivity. Shifting the main calorie intake to earlier circadian times may improve glucose metabolism, but genetic factors could influence the feasibility and effectiveness of eating-timing based interventions. The findings should be investigated in a larger cohort.

40292468,Epigenetic Aging Acceleration in Obesity Is Slowed Down by Nutritional Ketosis Following Very Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD): A New Perspective to Reverse Biological Age.,"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Epigenetic clocks have emerged as a tool to quantify biological age, providing a more accurate estimate of an individual's health status than chronological age, helping to identify risk factors for accelerated aging and evaluating the reversibility of therapeutic strategies. This study aimed to evaluate the potential association between epigenetic acceleration of biological age and obesity, as well as to determine whether nutritional interventions for body weight loss could slow down this acceleration. <b>Methods</b>: Biological age was estimated using three epigenetic clocks (Horvath (Hv), Hannum (Hn), and Levine (Lv)) based on the leukocyte methylome analysis of individuals with normal weight (n = 20), obesity (n = 24), and patients with obesity following a VLCKD (n = 10). We analyzed differences in biological age estimates, the relationship between age acceleration and obesity, and the impact of VLCKD. Correlations were assessed between age acceleration, BMI, and various metabolic parameters. <b>Results</b>: Analysis of the epigenetic clocks revealed an acceleration of biological age in individuals with obesity (Hv = +3.4(2.5), Hn = +5.7(3.2), Lv = +3.9(2.7)) compared to a slight deceleration in individuals with normal weight. This epigenetic acceleration correlated with BMI (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Interestingly, patients with obesity following a VLCKD showed a deceleration in estimated biological age, both in nutritional ketosis (Hv = -3.3(4.0), Hn = -6.3(5.3), Lv = -8.8(4.5)) and at endpoint (Hv = -1.1(4.3), Hn = -7.4(5.6), Lv = -8.2(5.3)). Relevantly, this slowdown in age is associated with BMI (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), ketonemia (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.001), and metabolic parameters (<i>p</i> < 0.05). <b>Conclusions</b>: Our findings highlight the applicability of epigenetic clocks to monitor obesity-related biological aging in precision medicine and show the potential efficacy of the VLCKD in slowing obesity-related epigenetic aging.",Izquierdo AG; Lorenzo PM; Costa-Fraga N; Primo-Martin D; Rodriguez-Carnero G; Nicoletti CF; Martínez JA; Casanueva FF; de Luis D; Diaz-Lagares A; Crujeiras AB,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40292468/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40284242,Influence of Genetic Polymorphisms and Biochemical Biomarkers on Response to Nutritional Iron Supplementation and Performance in a Professional Football Team: A Pilot Longitudinal Study.,"Iron deficiency is a prevalent issue among elite athletes, particularly in endurance-based sports like football, where optimal iron status is crucial for aerobic capacity and performance. Despite the well-documented role of iron in oxygen transport and energy metabolism, the interplay between genetic polymorphisms, biochemical markers, and iron supplementation remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between genetic polymorphisms and iron status in professional football players, assess the impact of iron supplementation on athletic performance, and develop a predictive model for iron supplementation based on genetic and biochemical profiles. A longitudinal study was conducted over three seasons (2021-2024) with 48 male professional football players. Participants underwent genotyping for polymorphisms in <i>ACE</i> (rs4646994), ACTN3 (rs1815739), <i>AMPD1</i> (rs17602729), <i>CKM</i> (rs8111989), <i>HFE</i> (rs1799945), and <i>MLCK</i> (rs2700352, rs28497577). Biochemical markers (ferritin, haemoglobin, haematocrit, serum iron) and performance metrics (GPS-derived data) were monitored. Iron supplementation (105 mg/day ferrous sulphate) was administered to players with ferritin <30 ng/mL. A Total Genotype Score (TGS) was calculated to evaluate genetic predisposition. Players with ""optimal"" genotypes (<i>ACE</i> DD, <i>ACTN3</i> CC, <i>AMPD1</i> CC, <i>HFE</i> GC) required less iron supplementation (TGS = 51.25 vs. 41.32 a.u.; <i>p</i> = 0.013) and exhibited better performance metrics. Iron supplementation significantly improved haemoglobin and haematocrit in deficient players (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The TGS predicted supplementation need (AUC = 0.711; <i>p</i> = 0.023), with a threshold of 46.42 a.u. (OR = 5.23, 95% CI: 1.336-14.362; <i>p</i> = 0.017 for non-supplemented players). Furthermore, performance data revealed that iron-supplemented players had significantly lower competition time (1128.40 vs. 1972.84 min; <i>p</i> = 0.003), total distance covered (128,129.42 vs. 218,556.64 m; <i>p</i> = 0.005), and high-speed running in the 18-21 km/h (7.58 vs. 10.36 m/min; <i>p</i> = 0.007) and 21-24 km/h (4.43 vs. 6.13 m/min; <i>p</i> = 0.010) speed zones. They also started fewer matches (11.50 vs. 21.59; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Genetic profile combined with biochemical monitoring effectively predicts iron supplementation needs in athletes. Personalized nutrition strategies, guided by TGS, can optimize iron status and enhance performance in elite football players.

Genome analysis revealed the presence of a complete C<sub>30</sub> carotenoid biosynthetic pathway, including genes encoding farnesyl diphosphate synthase, diapophytoene synthase, several diapophytoene desaturases, and distinct carotenoid glycosyltransferases and acyltransferases. Notably, the carotenoid pigments produced by the strain imparted a pink color, consistent with the coloration of its cell pellets. Based on these polyphasic taxonomic data, strain MBLB1832<sup>T</sup> is proposed as a novel species of the genus Paenibacillus, for which the name Paenibacillus roseopurpureus sp. nov. is suggested (type strain MBLB1832<sup>T</sup> = KCTC 43262<sup>T</sup> = JCM 34221<sup>T</sup>).",Hwang CY; Cho ES; Nam YD; Park SL; Lim SI; Seo MJ,Antonie van Leeuwenhoek,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40205261/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40189049,"Advances in Food-As-Medicine Interventions and Their Impact on Future Food Production, Processing, and Supply Chains.","Food-as-medicine (FAM) is an emerging trend among medical doctors, health insurers, startups, and governmental public-health and nongovernmental organizations. FAM implies using food as a part of an individual's health plan to prevent or help treat acute and chronic health conditions and diseases. We highlight trends and hurdles in the FAM intervention pyramid. Our viewpoint is to indicate how interventions might change the future demand for specific food groups, their transport in supply chains, and the technologies used to process them. On the basis of national guidelines, dietary interventions can help to prevent and treat many diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancers, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. FAM R&D and services offer more individualized treatments. This is challenging given the interindividual variability and complexity of the body's response to food and related factors, such as dietary habits, genetics, lifestyle, and biosphere. Quantifying health improvements is essential to prove the added value of more individualized FAM interventions compared with adopting a general healthy diet. It is unclear which level of individualization of interventions produces the largest health benefits at the lowest costs for the patient, healthcare system, and climate. FAM interventions can support and complement conventional medical treatment. They will require a shift to producing more health-promoting foods, including whole foods, minimally processed foods, and selected processed foods. The food processing industry and supply chains must adapt to these new scenarios. Auxiliary technologies and methods are enablers, including delivery services, wearable technology, health-monitoring apps, and data-driven consumer behavior analysis.",Defraeye T; Bahrami F; Kowatsch T; Annaheim S; Bragt MC; Rossi RM; Greger M,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40189049/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40184586,Cardiac Slc25a49-Mediated Energy Reprogramming Governs Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiomyopathy through the G6P-AP-1-Sln Axis.,"Doxorubicin (Dox), a potent antitumor drug, is linked to cardiac toxicity. Few mechanism-based therapies against cardiotoxicity are available. Dysfunction in mitochondrial energy metabolism contributes to Dox-induced cardiomyopathy. It is aimed at exploring the association between specific mechanism of energy reprogramming and Dox-induced cardiomyopathy. Cardiac-specific ablation of Slc25a49 mice are generated by crossing Slc25a49<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice with Myh6-Cre mice. Slc25a49<sup>HKO</sup> mice or SLC25A49<sup>KD</sup> cardiomyocytes is treated with Dox. Echocardiography, histological analysis, transmission electron microscopy, bulk RNA sequencing, cell bioenergetic profiling, metabolomics test, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and dual-luciferase reporter assay are conducted to delineate the phenotype and elucidate the molecular mechanisms. Specific ablation of Slc25a49 in cardiomyocytes leads to exacerbated Dox-induced cardiomyopathy, characterized by compromised mitochondrial respiration enhanced glycolysis and increased glycolytic metabolite glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) levels, subsequently activating the activator protein-1 (AP-1) complex. The stimulation of the G6P-AP-1 axis intensifies myocardial damage via transcriptionally regulating Sarcolipin (Sln) expression. Strikingly, targeting of this axis with the AP-1 inhibitor T-5224 effectively improves survival and enhances cardiac function in Dox-induced cardiomyopathy. This study provides mechanistic insights into energy reprogramming that permits myocardial dysfunction, and thus provides a proof of concept for antienergy reprogramming therapy for Dox-induced cardiomyopathy through directly modulating G6P-AP-1-Sln axis.",Wan S; Qi J; Xia Y; Fan C; Xu T; Zhang X; Shi J; Wang C; Cheng Y; Zhang D; Liu R; Zhu Y; Cao C; Jin D; An P; Luo Y; Luo J,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40184586/,0,0,0,0,0,0

In this study, we propose a precision nutrition approach aimed at lysosomal function in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Using patient-derived GBM cells, we identify lysosomal activity as a unique metabolic biomarker of tumorigenesis, controlling the efficacy of temozolomide (TMZ), a standard GBM therapy. Employing combined analyses of clinical patient samples and xenograft models, we further elucidate the pivotal role of Transcription Factor Binding To IGHM Enhancer 3 (TFE3), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, in modulating malignant properties, particularly TMZ tolerance, by regulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α)-mediated mitochondrial activity. Notably, we find that lysine protects GBM cells from lysosomal stress by counteracting arginine's effects on nitric oxide production. The lysine restriction mimetic, homoarginine administration, significantly enhances the efficacy of anticancer therapies through lysosomal dysfunction. This study underscores the critical role of lysosomal function modulated by amino acid metabolism in GBM pathogenesis and treatment.",Jing Y; Kobayashi M; Shoulkamy MI; Zhou M; Thi Vu H; Arakawa H; Sabit H; Iwabuchi S; Quang Vu C; Kasahara A; Ueno M; Tadokoro Y; Kurayoshi K; Chen X; Yan Y; Arai S; Hashimoto S; Soga T; Todo T; Nakada M; Hirao A,Nature communications,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40169552/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40158690,The role of micro-ribonucleic acid and small interfering-ribonucleic acid in precision nutrition for obesity management.,"Precision nutrition aims to tailor dietary interventions based on genetic and molecular profiles. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are emerging as critical tools in precision obesity management. miRNAs serve as biomarkers for predicting dietary response and obesity risk, while siRNAs provide a targeted approach to silencing obesity-related genes. This review explores the mechanisms, applications, and potential of integrating miRNA and siRNA in personalized dietary strategies to combat obesity. A comprehensive literature review was conducted using Boolean operations to identify studies on miRNAs, siRNAs, and their roles in precision nutrition. The review focused on molecular mechanisms, clinical applications, challenges, and future directions in integrating miRNA detection and siRNA therapy for obesity management. miRNAs regulate gene expression related to lipid metabolism, adipogenesis, and insulin sensitivity, with miRNA-33 and miRNA-103/107 being notable examples. siRNAs offer precise gene silencing for targets like SREBP-1c and PPARγ, addressing metabolic pathways resistant to dietary interventions. The synergistic integration of miRNAs as biomarkers and siRNAs as therapeutic tools enhances the personalization and efficacy of obesity management. The dual application of miRNAs and siRNAs in precision nutrition represents a transformative approach to obesity management. While challenges such as molecular stability and delivery systems persist, advancements in RNA technology and clinical research promise to revolutionize personalized dietary strategies.

40120915,Interaction between Bacteroides and HG-type pectins with different molecular weights.,"Pectins, a complex class of polysaccharides, are prominently represented by HG-chains, which are both abundant and extensively studied. Bacteroides species exhibit a remarkable ability to metabolize plant- and animal-derived polysaccharides, including the degradation of HG-type pectins through polysaccharide utilization locus (PUL). However, the effects of structurally diverse HG-type pectins on PUL expression, metabolite production, and metabolic pathways of Bacteroides remain unclear. Addressing this, this study chose HG-type pectins with different molecular weights from citrus (CP) and pomelo (PP), identified Bacteroides species capable of utilizing these pectins, studied the resulting metabolites through non-targeted metabolomics coupled with short-chain fatty acids analysis, and examined the activation of PUL and metabolic pathways by transcriptomic studies. The results showed that Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron A4 and Bacteroides caccae K9 could utilize HG-type pectins with different molecular weights. The production of propionic acid by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron A4 was significantly affected by the molecular weight of pectins. Utilizing CP, B. thetaiotaomicron A4 enriched metabolites such as carbohydrates, amino acids, peptides, amines, and significantly enhanced pathways such as sphingolipid metabolism and drug metabolism (other enzymes) through PUL75, PUL63, and PUL55. In contrast, when using PP, B. thetaiotaomicron A4 enriched similar metabolites and further upregulated pathways related to sphingolipid metabolism and pyrimidine metabolism. The molecular weight of HG-type pectins differentially affected the expression of carbohydrate-active enzymes and metabolic pathways, resulting in different metabolite profiles. This study aims to contribute to the understanding of structure-activity relationship between pectins and gut microbiota and to inform precision nutrition strategies.",Li S; Peng X; Wang Z; Chen C; Li X; Nie Q; Huang X; Bian S; Yin J; Cui SW; Tan H; Nie S,International journal of biological macromolecules,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40120915/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40108561,Gut microbiota signatures in food allergy children without and with malnutrition: a cross-sectional study.,"Altered gut microbiota (GM) profiles have been documented in children with food allergies (FA) and experiencing malnutrition. This study explored the GM composition in children with FA across varying degrees of malnutrition including those without malnutrition and those with different severity levels. Fresh faecal samples were collected from 120 children aged 1-6 years, including 40 FA children with adequate weight (FANM), 40 FA children with malnutrition (FAM), and 40 healthy controls. The hypervariable region of the 16 S rDNA gene was subsequently sequenced to assess bacterial communities. Compared with healthy controls, the FANM group displayed a greater increase in the alpha diversity index. The FAM group exhibited an increase in seven genera, including Alistipes and Parabacteroides, compared to the control group, whereas nine genera were enriched in the FANM group. An analysis of clinical characteristics revealed a positive correlation between the relative abundance of the genus Faecalibacterium and the total IgE level. Fourteen pivotal microbial markers demonstrated substantial classification potential (AUC: 89.86%, 95% CI: 76.40-99.73% for FAM; AUC: 88.92%, 95% CI: 73.58-99.65% for FANM).

40080262,"Molecular cloning, expression, and bioinformatics analysis of the CueO laccase gene from Escherichia coli SDB2.","Laccase CueO, a multicopper oxidase, possesses the capability to degrade phenolic compounds. In prior research, a strain of Escherichia coli named SDB2, isolated from chicken cecum, was found to degrade sinapine (a phenolic constituent of rapeseed meal) through the secretion of laccase CueO. Herein, the cloning, expression, and bioinformatics analysis of the CueO gene derived from E. coli SDB2 are reported. Sequence analysis indicated that SDB2 CueO comprised 1551 bp, 516 amino acids, a putative molecular weight of 56.65 kDa, and an isoelectric point (pI) of 6.21. BLAST comparisons showed that the CueO protein sequence from E. coli SDB2 exhibited 65-90% identity with CueO from other bacteria. Multiple alignment analysis further confirmed the similarity and identity of SDB2 CueO with CueO from other species, and the amino acids surrounding the Cu-binding sites were highly conserved. A phylogenetic tree demonstrated a close evolutionary relationship between CueO from E. coli and CueO from Citrobacter amalonaticus. The three-dimensional (3D) structural model revealed four copper (Cu)-binding regions. Recombinant CueO was successfully obtained by expressing the CueO gene in E. coli BL21 after isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction. Bioinformatics analysis confirmed the similarity of recombinant CueO with native CueO. These findings established a basis for understanding the characteristics and functions of laccase CueO from E. coli SDB2, paving the way for future research to explore the properties of recombinant CueO and its potential practical applications in optimizing feed resources, such as rapeseed meal, in the feed production industry.",Deng H; Li S; Huang Y; Li J; Ni Q; Zhao Y; Chen J; Peng X; Li B; Yu D,Molecular biology reports,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40080262/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40077648,Gene-Diet Interactions in High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol-Related Polymorphisms and Cardiovascular Disease Risk: Insights from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study.,"<b>Background</b>: Understanding gene-diet interactions is crucial for establishing dietary guidelines for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). This study analyzed the interaction between dietary intake and six genome-wide association study (GWAS)-identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and their impact on CVD risk. <b>Methods</b>: A total of 68,806 participants in the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) were analyzed. Six target SNPs (LPL: rs17482753; ABCA1: rs1883025; APOA5: rs651821; LIPC: rs1077835; CETP: rs17231506; and LIPG: rs9953437) were extracted from genome-wide SNP genotype data. Dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. SNP genotyping was conducted using the Korea Biobank Array (Korean Chip), a specialized genotyping platform designed for GWAS of blood biochemical traits in the Korean population. SNP-diet interactions on CVD risk were analyzed using generalized linear models (GLM). <b>Results</b>: Among the six SNPs, ABCA1: rs1883025 and APOA5: rs651821 showed significant gene-diet interactions. For rs1883025 (ABCA1), carriers of the T allele exhibited reduced HDL cholesterol levels. However, in the high-protein intake group, individuals with the T/T genotype had a significantly lower risk of ischemic stroke compared to those in the low-protein intake group (interaction <i>p</i>-value = 0.044). For rs651821 (APOA5), carriers of the T allele also had lower HDL cholesterol levels, but individuals with the C/C genotype (wild-type homozygotes) in the low-fat intake group showed a significantly reduced risk of coronary artery disease (interaction <i>p</i>-value = 0.0155). <b>Conclusions</b>: This study suggests potential interactions between polymorphisms associated with low HDL cholesterol and dietary patterns, particularly high-protein and low-fat diets, in relation to CVD risk. These findings highlight the importance of personalized dietary recommendations based on genetic profiles to reduce CVD risk. They provide a basis for future research aimed at developing precision nutrition guidelines and targeted interventions to manage hypo-HDL cholesterolemia and nutrition-related CVD risks.",Lee JH; Hong KW; Park BJ; Choi JE; Jung DH,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40077648/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40064213,Screening of intestinal protein signatures in pacific white-leg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) with white feces syndrome by proteome.,"White feces syndrome (WFS) has been one of the emerging diseases causing instructive economic losses in the penaeid shrimp aquaculture industry, though the etiology of WFS remains unclear. In this research, we have collected intestinal samples from normal and diseased shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) from the natural shrimp cultivation farm for histological and proteomic analysis. The preliminary pathogen detection confirmed that WFS in this study was (Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei) EHP-WFS that was related to Vibrio spp. Moreover, the destructive damage of the intestine in WFS-diseased shrimp revealed by histological observation indicated a deficiency in digestive capacity, which might be closely related to WFS. Furthermore, we have characterized 86 and 165 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) through a non-directional integrative analysis, which were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively. The down-regulation of various digestive enzymes in the WFS-diseased shrimp was consistent with the results of intestinal histology. DEPs were enriched in the lysosome and sphingolipid metabolism pathway, indicating that they were strongly associated with the occurrence of WFS (P < 0.05). Of this, the expression of down-regulated proteins in the lysosomal pathway was further validated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Ultimately, crustin, lipase, and glucosylceramidase (GBA), which were significantly decreased in WFS-diseased shrimp, were screened as the predictive protein signatures for the diagnosis and prevention of WFS. Consequently, our results will provide a theoretical reference for the diagnosis of EHP-WFS by the protein aspect and crustin, lipase, and GBA may be predictive signatures that are suitable for EHP-WFS.",Xv K; Pang A; Wang T; Luthfiah A; Zhang X; Tan B; Zhang W,Fish & shellfish immunology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40064213/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40054734,Involvement of disulfidptosis in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder.,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder, with oxidative stress recognized as a key pathogenic mechanisms. Oxidative stress disrupts intracellular dynamic- thiol/disulfide homeostasis (DTDH), potentially leading to disulfidptosis, a newly identified cell death mechanism. While studies suggest a link between DTDH and ASD, direct evidence implicating disulfidptosis in ASD pathogenesis remains limited. In this study, Mendelian randomization analysis revealed a significant causal association between disulfidptosis-related sulfhydryl oxidase 1 and 2 and ASD (OR1 = 0.883, OR2 = 0.924, p < 0.05). A positive correlation between protein disulfide-isomerase and cognitive performance (OR = 1.021, p < 0.01) further supported the role of disulfidptosis in ASD. Seven disulfidptosis-related genes (TIMP1, STAT3, VWA1, ADA, IL5, PF4, and TXNDC12) were identified and linked to immune cell alterations. A TF-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network and a predictive model (AUC = 0.759) were constructed and external validation datasets (AUC = 0.811). Immune infiltration analysis demonstrated altered expression of naive B cells and three other types of immune cells in ASD children. Animal experiments further validated the differential expression of key genes, highlighting their relevance to ASD pathogenesis. Animal experiments found that BTBR mice exhibit glucose starvation and NADPH depletion, with the specific indicator Slc7a11 being highly expressed. Silencing Slc7a11 can improve core ASD impairments in BTBR mice. CONCLUSION: This study establishes the first mechanistic link between disulfidptosis and ASD, identifies seven key genes and their regulatory network, and develops a predictive model with clinical utility. Animal experiments further confirmed the strong association between disulfidpotosis and ASD phenotypes. These findings offer novel therapeutic targets for modulating oxidative stress in ASD.",Liu Y; Sun Y; Chen A; Chen J; Zhu T; Wang S; Qiao W; Zhou D; Zhang X; Chen S; Shi Y; Yang Y; Wang J; Wu L; Fan L,Life sciences,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40054734/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40020917,Glycoprotein acetyls response to a mixed meal is associated with increased insulin resistance and risk of type 2 diabetes in a middle-aged population.,"Systemic inflammation increases the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). It remains unclear whether the inflammatory meal response identifies other people at risk of T2D than fasting levels alone. We aimed to examine associations between the meal response of glycoprotein acetyls (GlycA) with insulin resistance and incident type 2 diabetes. In 5755 middle-aged participants (47 % men) without pre-existing diabetes GlycA was measured after an overnight fast and 150 min after a liquid mixed meal (400 mL, 600 kCal, 16 percent of energy (En%) derived from protein, 50 En% carbohydrates, and 34 En% fat). With linear regression, we examined associations between the GlycA meal response and measures of insulin resistance. With Cox regression analyses, we examined associations between the GlycA meal response and incident type 2 diabetes, adjusted for demography and lifestyle factors. In our population, mean (SD) fasting GlycA was 1.28 (0.21) mmol/L and mean GlycA meal response was 0.16 (0.13) mmol/L, and these were weakly correlated (ρ = 0.19). After adjustment for confounding, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was 1.11-fold higher (95 % CI: 1.09; 1.13) per SD GlycA meal response. During a median follow-up of 6.7 years, 287 participants developed T2D. Per SD GlycA meal response, the adjusted hazard ratio of incident type 2 diabetes was 1.12 (95 % CI: 1.00; 1.26). In this middle-aged population with overweight, those with a high GlycA meal response, including those with low fasting GlycA, had an increased risk of diabetes. A high inflammatory meal response shows promise to identify other people at risk of T2D than fasting levels alone. This risk group may benefit from prevention by precision nutrition to reduce the inflammatory meal response.",Monahan RC; Li-Gao R; Noordam R; van der Velde JHPM; Willems van Dijk K; de Koning E; Mook-Kanamori DO; le Cessie S; Rosendaal FR; de Mutsert R,Clinical nutrition ESPEN,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40020917/,0,0,0,0,0,1

The aims were to evaluate the expression of OPN after caloric restriction-induced weight loss in adipose tissue (AT) from an animal model of diet-induced obesity (DIO) and to reflect these results on circulating OPN levels in patients with obesity (PWO); and to explore the effect of a very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) on the circulating protein and DNA methylation levels of OPN, compared with a balanced hypocaloric diet (LCD) or bariatric surgery (BS) in PWO. OPN/SPP1 expression was evaluated in subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral (VAT) AT derived from diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice and after a 4-week weight-loss protocol of calorie restriction (CR). Plasmatic OPN was also evaluated in 32 normal-weight volunteers (20 women) and 79 PWO (59 women) and after a 4-6 months follow up of a VLCKD (n = 20), BS (n = 39) or LCD (n = 20). DNA methylation levels of OPN were extracted from our Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips data sets. OPN levels were higher in VAT of DIO mice and plasma of PWO than in normal-weight individuals and changed after weight loss. Particularly, circulating OPN increased 2 months after BS while it decreased at maximum ketosis-induced by VLCKD. A statistically significant decrease was also observed in methylation levels at cg11226901 after VLCKD. OPN levels were reduced after VLCKD and severely increased after BS. Therefore, it could be a biomarker of the obesity-related metabolic stress and could be epigenetically regulated.",Lorenzo PM; Izquierdo AG; Sajoux I; Nuñez-Garcia M; Gomez-Arbelaez D; Zulet MA; Abete I; Baltar J; de Luis D; Tinahones FJ; Martinez JA; Casanueva FF; Crujeiras AB,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39986176/,0,0,0,0,0,1

In this study, the safety and probiotic potentials of Limosilactobacillus fermentum BGI-AF16 were evaluated by whole genome sequence analysis and in vitro experiments. Based on the gene analysis of antibiotic resistance and virulence factors, L. fermentum BGI-AF16 has been shown to be safe. We identified probiotic-related genes by genome annotation tools and conducted in vitro experiments to evaluate the ability of L. fermentum BGI-AF16 to inhibit pathogenic bacteria, tolerate a simulated gastrointestinal environment, and degrade uric acid. The results from in vitro experiments showed that L. fermentum BGI-AF16 had inhibitory effects on four clinically relevant pathogens and was highly tolerant to the gastrointestinal environment. In addition, L. fermentum BGI-AF16 was able to rapidly degrade uric acid within the first hour, and the strain could degrade 56.36 ± 2.32 % of uric acid by the third hour. The genome of the strain contains genes encoding flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent urate hydroxylase (EC.1.14.13.113), an enzyme that directly metabolizes uric acid.

39920984,The effect of modulation Piezo2 by IGF-1 on tactile hypersensitivity in BTBR model mice.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder. Individuals with ASD exhibit a higher incidence of tactile hypersensitivity. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The dorsal root ganglion (DRG) plays a crucial role in influencing tactile processing. This study aims to integrate RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and molecular biology experiments to identify key molecules involved in tactile hypersensitivity in ASD, further investigate related mechanisms, and develop effective intervention strategy. Using BTBR as the ASD model mouse and wild-type C57BL/6J as the control mouse, the differences in tactile sensitivity between them was compared. DRG were collected for RNA-seq analysis. Immunofluorescence and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques were employed to validate the identified key molecules. And combined western blot to investigate the associated regulatory pathways. BTBR mice exhibit tactile hypersensitivity, which are associated with the upregulation of IGF-1 in the DRG. IGF-1 regulates the expression of Piezo2 ion channels. Inhibition of the IGF-1/Piezo2 pathway can significantly alleviate tactile hypersensitivity and social deficits in BTBR mice. Additionally, gentle touch intervention has been shown to reduce the overexpression of IGF-1/Piezo2 in the DRG, thereby ameliorating ASD symptoms. The upregulation of the IGF-1/Piezo2 pathway in DRG may serve as a potential mechanism for tactile hypersensitivity observed in BTBR mice. Restoring the normalization of the IGF-1/Piezo2 is crucial for alleviating tactile hypersensitivity and synergistically rescues social deficits. Gentle touch intervention has the potential to ameliorate these behaviors through regulating IGF-1/Piezo2, positioning it as a promising strategy for ASD.",Zhai J; Hao H; Xu Z; Tomoda A; Zhang X; Wang X; Liu Y; Cao X; Li D; Zhang Y; Yao X; Fan L; Wang J,Life sciences,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39920984/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39915446,ROS-induced cytosolic release of mitochondrial PGAM5 promotes colorectal cancer progression by interacting with MST3.,"Aberrant release of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) in response to cellular stress is well known for promoting cancer progression. However, precise molecular mechanism by which mtROS contribute to epithelial cancer progression remains only partially understood. Here, using colorectal cancer (CRC) models, we show that upon sensing excessive mtROS, phosphatase PGAM5, which normally localizes to the mitochondria, undergoes aberrant cleavage by presenilin-associated rhomboid-like protein (PARL), becoming released into the cytoplasm. Cytosolic PGAM5 then directly binds to and dephosphorylates MST3 kinase. This, in turn, prevents STK25-mediated LATS1/2 phosphorylation, leading to YAP activation and CRC progression. Importantly, depletion of MST3 reciprocally promotes accumulation of cytosolic PGAM5 by inducing mitochondrial damage. Taken together, these findings demonstrate how mtROS promotes CRC progression by activating YAP via a post-transcriptional positive feedback loop between PGAM5 and MST3, both of which can serve as potential targets for developing next-generation anti-colon cancer therapeutics.",Wang S; Wu X; Bi W; Xu J; Hou L; Li G; Pan Y; Zhang H; Li M; Du S; Zhang M; Liu D; Jin S; Shi X; Tian Y; Shuai J; Plikus MV; Song M; Zhou Z; Yu L; Lv C; Yu Z,Nature communications,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39915446/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39907890,Personalizing Dietary Polyphenols for Health Maintenance and Disease Management: A Nutrigenetic Approach.,"This literature review provides examples of the influence of certain genetic variants on health outcomes after dietary polyphenol consumption or supplementation. Available evidence is organized according to the major classes of polyphenols (flavonoids, phenolic acids, stilbenes, lignans, and tannins) and their derived subgroups. Nutrigenetic studies have identified mainly single nucleotide polymorphisms located within genes involved in the biotransformation of phenolic acids, stilbenes, lignans and several flavonoid molecules. These genetic variants may affect polyphenol metabolism rates and related predisposition to chronic non-communicable diseases. Moreover, differential cardiometabolic outcomes upon polyphenol supplementation as dietary sources or nutraceuticals have been modulated by specific genotypes. Although current evidence is still limited, growing gene-polyphenol interactions are contributing to systematically elucidate the biological functions of polyphenols; determine individual risk phenotypes to specific diseases or particular responses upon polyphenol exposure; and facilitate the prescription of personalized genotype-based doses of dietary polyphenols to optimize related health benefits. Additionally, the integration of genetics with other omics insights (epigenomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, and metabolomics) trough biological systems and high-dimensional data analyses and interpretation may provide a more comprehensive understanding of polyphenol metabolism for precision nutrition applications in health and disease.",Ramos-Lopez O,Current nutrition reports,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39907890/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39882755,Precision nutrition-based interventions for the management of obesity in children and adolescents up to the age of 19 years.,"Precision nutrition-based methods develop tailored interventions and/or recommendations accounting for determinants of intra- and inter-individual variation in response to the same diet, compared to current 'one-size-fits-all' population-level approaches. Determinants may include genetics, current dietary habits and eating patterns, circadian rhythms, health status, gut microbiome, socioeconomic and psychosocial characteristics, and physical activity. ​​​​In this systematic review, we examined the evidence base for the effect of interventions based on precision nutrition approaches on overweight and obesity in children and adolescents to help inform future research and global guidelines. To examine the impact of precision nutrition-based interventions for the management of obesity in children and adolescents in all their diversity. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science Core Collection, BIOSIS Previews, Global Index Medicus (all regions), IBECS, SciELO, PAHO, PAHO IRIS, WHO IRIS, WHOLIS, Bibliomap, and TRoPHI, as well as the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov. We last searched the databases on 23 July 2024. We did not apply any language restrictions. We included randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that evaluated precision nutrition-based interventions (accounting for 'omics' such as phenotyping, genotyping, gut microbiome; clinical data, baseline dietary intake, postprandial glucose response, etc., and/or including artificial intelligence such as machine learning methods) compared to general or one-size-fits-all interventions or no intervention in children and adolescents aged 0 to 9 years or 10 to 19 years with overweight or obesity. Two review authors independently conducted study screening, data extraction, and risk of bias and GRADE assessments. We used fixed-effect analyses. Our outcomes of interest were physical and mental well-being, physical activity, health-related quality of life, obesity-associated disability, and adverse events associated with the interventions as defined or measured by trialists, and weight change (reduction, stabilisation or maintenance). Two studies (3 references, 105 participants) conducted in Ukraine and Greece met our eligibility criteria. One study reported nonprofit funding sources, whilst the other did not report funding, and the certainty of evidence ranged from very low to low across outcomes (all measured at endpoint). Only one trial (65 participants) contributed data on our primary outcomes of interest. Precision nutrition-based intervention versus one-size-fits-all intervention or standard of care In children 0 to 9 years of age, evidence is very uncertain about the effect of a precision nutrition-based intervention (a computerised Decision Support Tool (DST) that incorporates a variety of participant data and provides personalised diet recommendations based on decision-tree algorithms) on body mass index (BMI) (mean difference (MD) -1.40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.48 to 0.68; 1 study, 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and on weight (MD -2.60 kg, 95% CI -8.42 to 3.22; 1 study, 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence) compared with a one-size-fits-all control intervention. In children and adolescents 10 to 19 years of age, evidence is very uncertain about the effect of a precision nutrition-based intervention (computerised DST) on BMI (MD 3.00 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95% CI -0.26 to 6.26; 1 study, 30 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and on weight (MD 11.40 kg, 95% CI -0.47 to 23.27; 1 study, 30 participants; very low-certainty evidence) compared with a one-size-fits-all control intervention. Based on data from two small studies with a total of 105 participants, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of precision nutrition-based interventions on body weight or BMI. This review was limited by the number of available randomised controlled trials in this relatively nascent field. Given these limitations, the two studies do not provide sufficient evidence to adequately inform practice. Future research should report participant outcome data, including outcomes related to mental, emotional, and functional well-being, in addition to biochemical and physical measures, stratified by World Health Organization-defined age groups (children (0 to 9 years), and children and adolescents (10 to 19 years)). Future studies should also report methods related to randomisation, blinding, and compliance, as well as include prespecified analysis plans.",Huey SL; Mehta NH; Steinhouse RS; Jin Y; Kibbee M; Kuriyan R; Finkelstein JL; Mehta S,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39882755/,0,1,0,1,0,0
39861379,Integrating 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing and Metabolomics Analysis to Reveal the Mechanism of L-Proline in Preventing Autism-like Behavior in Mice.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impaired social interaction and repetitive stereotyped behavior. Effective interventions for the core autistic symptoms are currently limited. This study employed a valproic acid (VPA)-induced mouse model of ASD to assess the preventative effects of L-proline supplementation on ASD-like behaviors. The method of 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics analyses were conducted to investigate the modulation of gut microbiota and gut metabolites by L-proline. The results indicated that L-proline supplementation significantly prevented ASD-like behavioral disorders, including alleviating social communication deficits and reducing repetitive behavior in the ASD mice. The 16S rRNA sequencing analysis revealed that L-proline regulated the composition and structure of gut microbiota. L-Proline supplementation enhances the abundance of the <i>Verrucomicrobia</i> at the phylum level and the <i>Akkermansia</i> at the genus level, while concurrently reducing the abundance of the <i>Patescibacteria</i> at the phylum level, as well as the <i>Ileibacterium</i>, <i>Candidatus_Saccharimonas</i>, and <i>Lachnospiraceae_UCG-006</i> at the genus level in the VPA-induced mouse model for ASD. Additionally, the untargeted metabolomics results indicated that L-proline also modified the gut metabolite profiles. Functional analysis of the gut microbiota and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of differential metabolites between the L-proline-supplemented and VPA groups corroborated that L-proline decreased pathways related to nucleotide metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, and pyruvate metabolism, while increasing pathways involved in alpha-linolenic acid metabolism and phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis. The integrative metabolomic and microbiome analyses showed strong connections between the gut metabolites and gut microbiota affected by L-proline. These findings suggest that the modulatory effects of L-proline on gut microbiota and its metabolites may play a crucial role in preventing autism in mice. These findings suggest that dietary L-proline may represent a viable, effective option for preventing the physiological and behavioral deficits associated with ASD in mice.",Fang J; Kang SG; Huang K; Tong T,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39861379/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39861372,Vitamin Metabolism and Its Dependency on Genetic Variations Among Healthy Adults: A Systematic Review for Precision Nutrition Strategies.,"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in precision nutrition and its potential for disease prevention. Differences in individual responses to diet, especially among populations of different ancestry, have underlined the importance of understanding the effects of genetic variations on nutrient intake (nutrigenomics). Since humans generally cannot synthesize essential vitamins, the maintenance of healthy bodily functions depends on dietary vitamin intake. Understanding the differences in vitamin uptake and metabolism across diverse populations may allow for targeted treatment plans and improved overall health. We assessed the current scientific evidence on genetic variations (such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) affecting vitamin metabolism in humans. A systematic literature review of primary studies on genetic variations associated with (personalized) nutrition was conducted. Using key terms related to personalized nutrition, nutrigenomics, SNPs, and genetic variations, three online databases were searched for studies published between 2007 and 2023 that included healthy adult subjects. Only results that were confirmed at least once were included. Study quality was assessed with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool. Eighty-six articles were included in this review. Our analysis revealed associations with homocysteine metabolism and B Vitamins, Vitamin D, and components of Vitamin E. Genetic associations with Vitamin D, particularly with the GC gene, were extensively researched and linked to lower 25(OH)D concentrations, with sunlight exposure as a contributing factor. Most variants had a negative effect on homocysteine levels. Additionally, we observed general increases in carotenoid levels in the presence of SNPs, although more research on Selenium and Selenoprotein P concentrations is warranted. No studies on Vitamin C were obtained, indicating an area for further methodological improvement. Ancestry is believed to be a significant factor influencing SNP associations and significance. The current review emphasizes the importance of genetics in targeted disease prevention and health care. Our comprehensive findings may provide healthcare practitioners with reliable information to make recommendations in precision nutrition, specifically vitamin supplementation.",Bösch ES; Spörri J; Scherr J,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39861372/,0,1,0,0,0,0
39805824,High interindividual variability of indoxyl sulfate production identified by an oral tryptophan challenge test.,"Indoxyl sulfate (IS) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. IS is converted from indole, a metabolite of dietary tryptophan through the action of gut microbial tryptophanase, by two hepatic enzymes: CYP2E1 and SULT1A1. We hypothesized that the effect of tryptophan intake on IS production might differ from person to person. We enrolled 72 healthy persons (33 ± 7 years; 54.2% women) to undergo an oral tryptophan challenge test (OTCT), in which 7 blood samples were collected at 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h following oral administration of L-tryptophan 2000 mg. We observed high interindividual variability of IS production in the response to an OTCT. Twenty-four subjects in the lowest tertile of the baseline-adjusted area under the curve of IS were defined as low-IS producers, whereas 24 subjects in the highest tertile were defined as high-IS producers. There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics or CYP2E1 and SULT1A1-SNP genotyping distributions between the two IS-producing phenotypes. However, distinct differences in gut microbial composition were identified. In addition, the abundance of tryptophanase was significantly higher in the high-IS producers than in the low-IS producers (P = 0.01). The OTCT may serve as personalized dietary guidance. High-IS producers are more likely to be at greater risk of cardiovascular diseases and may benefit from consuming foods low in tryptophan. Potential clinical applications of the OTCT in precision nutrition warrant further investigation.",Lin TY; Wu WK; Hung SC,NPJ biofilms and microbiomes,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39805824/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39796537,The Contribution of Precision Nutrition Intervention in Subfertile Couples.,"Subfertility is characterized by a decrease in reproductive efficiency, which can result in delayed pregnancy, and affects one in six individuals during their lifetime. The present narrative review aims to evaluate the contribution of precision nutrition to changes in fertility in subfertile couples. The literature review was carried out through bibliographic research in the PubMed, Scopus, SciELO and Google Scholar databases. The following search criteria were applied: (1) original articles and narrative, systematic or meta-analytic reviews, and (2) the individual or combined use of the following keywords: ""genetic variation"", ""nutrigenetics"", ""precision nutrition"", ""couple's subfertility"", and ""couple's infertility"". A preliminary reading of all the articles was carried out, and only those that best fit the themes and subthemes of the narrative review were selected. Scientific evidence suggests that adherence to a healthy diet that follows the Mediterranean pattern is associated with increased fertility in women and improved semen quality in men, better metabolic health and reduced levels of inflammation and oxidative stress, as well as maintaining a healthy body weight. The integration of different tools, such as nutrigenetics, predictive biochemical analyses, intestinal microbiota tests and clinical nutrition software, used in precision nutrition interventions can contribute to providing information on how diet and genetics interact and how they can influence fertility. The adoption of a multidisciplinary and precision approach allows the design of dietary and lifestyle recommendations adapted to the specific characteristics and needs of couples with subfertility, thus optimizing reproductive health outcomes and achieving successful conception.",Monteiro J; Bicho M; Valente A,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39796537/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39796476,Emerging Biomarkers and Determinants of Lipoprotein Profiles to Predict CVD Risk: Implications for Precision Nutrition.,"Biomarkers constitute a valuable tool to diagnose both the incidence and the prevalence of chronic diseases and may help to inform the design and effectiveness of precision nutrition interventions. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be the foremost cause of death all over the world. While the reasons that lead to increased risk for CVD are multifactorial, dyslipidemias, plasma concentrations of specific lipoproteins, and dynamic measures of lipoprotein function are strong biomarkers to predict and document coronary heart disease incidence. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the biomarkers and emerging approaches that can be utilized to characterize lipoprotein profiles as predictive tools for assessing CVD risk, including the assessment of traditional clinical lipid panels, measures of lipoprotein efflux capacity and inflammatory and antioxidant activity, and omics-based characterization of lipoprotein composition and regulators of lipoprotein metabolism. In addition, we discuss demographic, genetic, metagenomic, and lifestyle determinants of lipoprotein profiles-such as age, sex, gene variants and single-nucleotide polymorphisms, gut microbiome profiles, dietary patterns, physical inactivity, obesity status, smoking and alcohol intake, and stress-which are likely to be essential factors to explain interindividual responses to precision nutrition recommendations to mitigate CVD risk.",Andersen CJ; Fernandez ML,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39796476/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39744623,Serum fatty acid profiles in systemic lupus erythematosus and patient reported outcomes: The Michigan Lupus Epidemiology & Surveillance (MILES) Program.,"Despite progress in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) treatment, challenges persist in medication adherence due to side effects and costs. Precision nutrition, particularly adjusting fatty acid intake, offers a cost-effective strategy for enhancing SLE management. Prior research, including our own, indicates that increased consumption of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) correlates with improved outcomes in SLE patients. Here we build upon these findings by investigating associations between serum fatty acids-grouped as PUFAs, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and saturated fatty acids (SFAs)-and lupus activity, pain, and sleep disturbance. Using data from 418 participants with SLE in the Michigan Lupus Epidemiology and Surveillance (MILES) Cohort, we examined associations between serum levels of 25 fatty acids determined by GC-MS and patient-reported outcomes. Disease activity, pain, and sleep quality were assessed using standardized questionnaires. Generalized additive models and partial residual plots were utilized to examine the linearity of fatty acid effects. Variable selection was performed using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), followed by multiple linear regression adjusting for sociodemographic factors. Findings indicated favorable associations between ω-3 PUFAs-and, to a lesser extent, ω-6 PUFAs-and patient-reported outcomes, while MUFAs and SFAs showed unfavorable associations. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 PUFA, exhibited the most robust favorable associations across all outcomes. Additionally, the omega-3 α-linolenic acid (ALA) was linked to reduced pain, whereas eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), another omega-3, was associated with worsened disease activity and pain. Among omega-6 PUFAs, dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA) was favorably associated with disease activity, while the omega-9 PUFA Mead acid was linked to increased pain. These findings underscore the prospect that increased tissue levels of long-chain omega-3 PUFAs, particularly DHA, are favorably associated with SLE outcomes. Although further research is needed to establish causal relationships, existing evidence supports the role of omega-3 PUFAs in managing cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease, common SLE comorbidities. Most study participants exhibited low omega-3 PUFA status, suggesting substantial potential for improvement through targeted dietary interventions and supplementation. This study supports a potential role for precision nutrition in comprehensive SLE management, considering the impact of PUFAs, SFAs and MUFAs.",Gilley KN; Fenton JI; Zick SM; Li K; Wang L; Marder W; McCune WJ; Jain R; Herndon-Fenton S; Hassett AL; Barbour KE; Pestka JJ; Somers EC,Frontiers in immunology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39744623/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39722590,Gut microbes with the <i>gbu</i> genes determine TMAO production from L-carnitine intake and serve as a biomarker for precision nutrition.,"Gut microbial metabolism of L-carnitine, which leads to the production of detrimental trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), offers a plausible link between red meat consumption and cardiovascular risks. Several microbial genes, including <i>cntA/B</i>, the <i>cai</i> operon, and the recently identified <i>gbu</i> gene cluster, have been implicated in the conversion of dietary L-carnitine into TMA(O). However, the key microbial genes and associated gut microbes involved in this pathway have not been fully explored. Utilizing the oral carnitine challenge test (OCCT), which specifically measures TMAO production from L-carnitine intake and identifies TMAO producer phenotypes, we compared the abundance of microbial genes between low- and high-TMAO producers across three independent cohorts. Our findings consistently revealed that the <i>gbu</i> gene cluster, rather than <i>cntA/B</i> or the <i>cai</i> operon, was significantly enriched in high-TMAO producers. We further analyzed 292 paired multi-omic datasets from OCCT and shotgun metagenomic sequencing, which demonstrated a significant positive correlation between the abundance of fecal <i>gbu</i> genes and L-carnitine-induced TMAO production, with <i>gbuB</i> showing the strongest correlation. Interestingly, these fecal <i>gbu</i> genes were found to increase with L-carnitine supplementation and decrease with a plant-based diet. Notably, we verified a previously uncultured <i>gbu</i>-containing bacterium, JAGTTR01 sp018223385, as the major contributor to TMA formation in the human gut. We isolated these <i>gbu</i>-containing gut microbes and confirmed their role in TMA/TMAO production using anaerobic incubation and a gnotobiotic mouse model. Using an in-house collection of <i>gbu</i>-containing isolates, we developed a qPCR-based method to quantify fecal <i>gbuB</i> and validated its correlation with L-carnitine-mediated TMAO production as measured by OCCT. Overall, these findings suggest that <i>gbu</i>-containing gut microbes are crucial for TMAO increases following L-carnitine intake and may serve as biomarkers or targets for personalized nutrition.",Wu WK; Lo YL; Chiu JY; Hsu CL; Lo IH; Panyod S; Liao YC; Chiu THT; Yang YT; Kuo HC; Zou HB; Chen YH; Chuang HL; Yen JJY; Wang JT; Chiu HM; Hsu CC; Kuo CH; Sheen LY; Kao HL; Wu MS,Gut microbes,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39722590/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39705912,Phenotype variability in diet-induced obesity and response to (-)-epigallocatechin gallate supplementation in a Diversity Outbred mouse cohort: A model for exploring gene x diet interactions for dietary bioactives.,"The flavan-3-ol (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) blunts obesity in inbred mice, but human clinical trials have yielded mixed results. Genetic homogeneity in preclinical models may explain translational disconnect between rodents and humans. The Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse model provides genotype and phenotype variability for characterization of gene x environment (i.e., diet) interactions. We conducted a longitudinal phenotyping study in DO mice. Mice (n = 50) were fed a high-fat diet for 8 weeks and then a high-fat diet + 0.3% EGCG for 8 weeks. We hypothesized that obesity and any protective effects of EGCG would exhibit extreme variability in these genetically heterogeneous mice. As anticipated, DO mice exhibited extreme variation in body composition at baseline (4%-13.9% fat), after 8 weeks of high-fat diet (6.5%-38.1% fat), and after 8 weeks of high-fat diet + EGCG (7.6%-42.6% fat), greater than what is observed in inbred mice. All 50 mice gained body fat on the high-fat diet (changes from baseline of +5% ± 640%). Intriguingly, adiposity variability increased when EGCG was added to the diet (changes from the high-fat diet alone of -52% ± 390%), with 11/50 mice losing body fat. We postulate that the explanation for this variability is genetic heterogeneity. Our data confirm the promise for EGCG to manage obesity but suggest that genetic factors may exert significant control over the efficacy of EGCG. Larger studies in DO mice are needed for quantitative trait loci mapping to identify genetic loci governing EGCG x obesity interactions and translate these findings to precision nutrition in humans.",Sweet MG; Iglesias-Carres L; Ellsworth PN; Carter JD; Nielsen DM; Aylor DL; Tessem JS; Neilson AP,"Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39705912/,0,0,0,0,0,1
39684798,The microRNA-29ab1/Zfp36/AR Axis in the Hypothalamus Regulates Male-Typical Behaviors in Mice.,"Male-typical behaviors such as aggression and mating, which reflect sexual libido in male mice, are regulated by the hypothalamus, a crucial part of the nervous system. Previous studies have demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs), especially <i>miR-29</i>, play a vital role in reproduction and the neural control of behaviors. However, it remains unclear whether <i>miR-29</i> affects reproduction through the hypothalamus-mediated regulation of male-typical behaviors. Here, we constructed two mouse knockout models by ablating either the <i>miR-29ab1</i> or <i>miR-29b2c</i> cluster. Compared to WT, the ablation of <i>miR-29ab1</i> in male mice significantly reduced the incidence of aggression by 60% and the incidence of mating by 46.15%. Furthermore, the loss of <i>miR-29ab1</i> in male mice led to the downregulation of androgen receptor (AR) in the ventromedial hypothalamus. Transcriptomic analysis of the hypothalamus of <i>miR-29ab1</i>-deficient mice revealed inflammatory activation and aberrant expression of genes associated with male-typical behaviors, including <i>Ar</i>, <i>Pgr</i>, <i>Htr4</i>, and <i>Htr2c</i>. Using bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assays, we identified zinc finger protein 36 (<i>Zfp36</i>) as a direct downstream target gene of <i>miR-29ab1</i>. We subsequently showed that ZFP36 colocalized with AR in GT1-7 cells. Furthermore, inhibition of <i>Zfp36</i> or <i>RelB</i> in GT1-7 cells led to an increase in AR expression. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the <i>miR-29ab1/Zfp36/AR</i> axis in the hypothalamus plays a pivotal role in the regulation of aggression and mating in male mice, providing a potential therapeutic target for treating infertility caused by low libido.",Ma J; Lin Y; Xiong W; Liu X; Pan M; Sun J; Sun Y; Li Y; Guo H; Pang G; Wang X; Ren F,International journal of molecular sciences,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39684798/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Machine learning models highlighted specific microbial signatures for each sex, achieving high accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.91 for women and 0.72 for men). The key microbial taxa linked to MASLD included <i>Christensenella</i> and <i>Limosilactobacillus</i> in women and <i>Beduinibacterium</i> and <i>Anaerotruncus</i> in men. Functional profiling showed that MASLD patients had increased pathways for amine biosynthesis and amino acid degradation, while the controls exhibited enhanced fermentation pathways. These microbial features were associated with systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, and metabolite production linked to gut dysbiosis. <b>Conclusions</b>: The findings support the potential of gut microbiota signatures to be used as non-invasive indicators of MASLD and highlight sex-specific variations that could inform personalized diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",Mogna-Peláez P; Riezu-Boj JI; Milagro FI; Clemente-Larramendi I; Esteban Echeverría S; Herrero JI; Elorz M; Benito-Boillos A; Tobaruela-Resola AL; González-Muniesa P; Tur JA; Martínez JA; Abete I; Zulet MA,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39683591/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Nutritional genomics, which studies gene-nutrient interactions, has emerged as a promising field for AMD prevention and management. Genetic predispositions, such as variants in <i>CFH</i>, <i>C3</i>, <i>C2/CFB</i>, <i>APOE</i>, and oxidative stress pathways, significantly affect the risk and progression of AMD. <b>Methods:</b> This narrative review synthesizes findings from randomized controlled trials and recent advances in nutritional genomics research. It examines the interplay between genetic predispositions and dietary interventions, exploring how personalized nutritional strategies can optimize AMD management. <b>Results and Discussion:</b> The AREDS and AREDS2 trials demonstrated that supplements, including vitamins C, E, zinc, copper, lutein, and zeaxanthin, can reduce the progression to advanced AMD. Nutritional interventions tailored to genetic profiles show promise: <i>CFH</i> risk alleles may enhance zinc supplementation's anti-inflammatory effects, while <i>APOE</i> variants influence the response to omega-3 fatty acids. Adjusting carotenoid intake, such as lutein and zeaxanthin, based on genetic susceptibility exemplifies emerging precision nutritional approaches. Ongoing research seeks to integrate nutrigenomic testing into clinical settings, enabling clinicians to tailor interventions to individual genetic profiles. <b>Conclusions:</b> Further studies are needed to assess the long-term effects of personalized interventions, investigate additional genetic variants, and develop tools for clinical implementation of nutrigenomics.

39663494,π-HuB: the proteomic navigator of the human body.,"The human body contains trillions of cells, classified into specific cell types, with diverse morphologies and functions. In addition, cells of the same type can assume different states within an individual's body during their lifetime. Understanding the complexities of the proteome in the context of a human organism and its many potential states is a necessary requirement to understanding human biology, but these complexities can neither be predicted from the genome, nor have they been systematically measurable with available technologies. Recent advances in proteomic technology and computational sciences now provide opportunities to investigate the intricate biology of the human body at unprecedented resolution and scale. Here we introduce a big-science endeavour called π-HuB (proteomic navigator of the human body). The aim of the π-HuB project is to (1) generate and harness multimodality proteomic datasets to enhance our understanding of human biology; (2) facilitate disease risk assessment and diagnosis; (3) uncover new drug targets; (4) optimize appropriate therapeutic strategies; and (5) enable intelligent healthcare, thereby ushering in a new era of proteomics-driven phronesis medicine.

39640571,Combined effects of genetic background and diet on mouse metabolism and gene expression.,"In humans, dietary patterns impact weight and metabolism differentially across individuals. To uncover genetic determinants for differential dietary effects, we subjected four genetically diverse mouse strains to humanized diets (American, Mediterranean, vegetarian, and vegan) with similar macronutrient composition, and performed body weight, metabolic parameter, and RNA-seq analysis. We observed pronounced diet- and strain-dependent effects on weight, and triglyceride and insulin levels. Differences in fat mass, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle glucose uptake, and gene expression changes in most tissues were strain-dependent. In visceral adipose tissue, ∼400 genes responded to diet in a strain-dependent manner, many of them in metabolite transport and lipid metabolism pathways and several previously identified to modify diet effects in humans. Thus, genetic background profoundly impacts metabolism, though chosen dietary patterns modify the strong genetic effects.

39603182,"Genetic variants in the PKD1L2/BCO1 region are associated with β-carotene, lutein, and zeaxanthin: A genome-wide association study of plasma carotenoids.","Carotenoid consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of several chronic diseases. Inter-individual genetic variation may explain some of the observed differences in plasma carotenoid concentrations between individuals. Identifying genetic variants associated with circulating carotenoids in young adults may help identify individuals at increased risk for developing conditions associated with low carotenoids later in life. We hypothesize that common genetic variants are associated with circulating carotenoid concentrations in a population of young adults. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) on plasma carotenoids (α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lutein, and zeaxanthin) was conducted in Caucasians (n = 393) from the Toronto Nutrigenomics and Health Study. Replication cohorts included individuals of Caucasian (n = 193), East Asian (n = 436) and South Asian (n = 135) ethnicity. Linear regression adjusted for age, sex, BMI, total serum cholesterol, dietary carotenoid intake and population structure were used to identify associations between genetic variants and plasma carotenoids. Associations that met the threshold for genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10<sup>-8</sup>) in unadjusted and partially adjusted models were not observed in the replication cohorts. No variants achieved genome-wide significance in fully adjusted models. Previously identified associations between variation in the PKD1L2/BCO1 region and β-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin were replicated in the GWAS cohort (p < .05). Established variation in the PKD1L2/BCO1 region is associated with plasma carotenoids. These variants may help to identify individuals who require greater amounts of these antioxidants and to provide precision nutrition recommendations for optimal intake of various carotenoids.",Jamnik J; Mahdavi S; El-Sohemy A,"Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39603182/,0,0,0,0,0,0

39582289,m<sup>6</sup>A Reader PRRC2A Promotes Colorectal Cancer Progression via CK1ε-Mediated Activation of WNT and YAP Signaling Pathways.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer type and the second highest mortality rate among cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying CRC progression remain to be fully understood. In this work, a recently identified m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RNA reader protein Proline-rich Coiled-coil 2a (PRRC2A) is markedly upregulated in CRC, and intestinal epithelium-specific deletion of Prrc2a significantly suppressed tumor cell growth, stemness, and migratory capacity, while its overexpression promoted these behaviors. Through multiomics analysis, PRRC2A directly targeted CSNK1E (encoding CK1ε), maintaining its RNA stability in an m<sup>6</sup>A-dependent manner, and that elevated CK1ε can concomitantly result in activation of the WNT and YAP signaling pathways. Interestingly, PRRC2A is directly regulated by the transcription factor ATF1 in its promoter. In summary, the work reveals a novel mechanism by which m<sup>6</sup>A reader PRRC2A promotes colorectal cancer progression via CK1ε and aberrant upregulation of WNT and YAP signaling. Therefore, PRRC2A and CK1ε can be potential therapeutic targets for treating CRC.",Wu X; Wang S; Pan Y; Li M; Song M; Zhang H; Deng M; Yang X; Xu J; Zhang S; Zhang J; Wang F; Plikus MV; Lv C; Yu L; Yu Z,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39582289/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39564988,Tryptophan Metabolism-Regulating Probiotics Alleviate Hyperuricemia by Protecting the Gut Barrier Integrity and Enhancing Colonic Uric Acid Excretion.,"The balance of gut microbiota affects uric acid synthesis and excretion, influencing the development of hyperuricemia. This study aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of probiotics on hyperuricemia and adenine- and potassium oxonate-induced colonic damage. After two months of gavage at 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/day, the probiotic strains <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i> UA260 and <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> YU28, identified through <i>in vitro</i> screening, significantly reduced serum uric acid levels in hyperuricemia mice from 109.71 ± 56.33 to 38.76 ± 15.06 and 33.22 ± 6.91 μmol/L, respectively. These strains attenuated inflammatory, repaired gut barrier damage, and enhanced colonic uric acid transporter function, thereby promoting uric acid excretion. Furthermore, the probiotics significantly reshaped gut microbiota by increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria, including <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Coprococcus</i>, while modulating tryptophan, purine, and riboflavin metabolism. Changes in tryptophan metabolites, specifically indole-3-propionic acid and indole-3-acetic acid, were correlated with xanthine oxidase activity, colonic injury, and the expression of the uric acid transporter protein ABCG2 during treatment. Probiotics intervention activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor pathways. These findings suggest that probiotics alleviate hyperuricemia and colonic inflammatory by regulating gut microbiota composition and tryptophan microbial metabolite pathways. Probiotics that modulate tryptophan microbial metabolism may provide a potential strategy for treating or preventing hyperuricemia.",Wang Q; Liang J; Zou Q; Wang W; Yan G; Guo R; Yuan T; Wang Y; Liu X; Liu Z,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39564988/,0,0,0,0,0,0

In this study, G50 high-amylose maize starch with different molecular weights was first prepared by pullulanase and α-amylase, and their effects on the structural formation, digestion properties, and release behaviors of the starch-resveratrol (RA) complex were discussed. The results confirmed that enzyme-treated starch could enhance intermolecular hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions between starch and RA in a high-pressure homogeneous (HPH) environment, forming stable single-helix and V-type crystalline structures while reducing the B-type crystalline structures. Meanwhile, the in vitro experiment showed that when the RA addition was 3%, the resistant starch content of the starch-RA complex could reach 60.3%, and its RA colonic transport rate could reach more than 97%. Interestingly, the starch-RA complex with a relatively higher V-type crystalline structure content contributed to the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), especially butyrate, and it might be effective in carbohydrate metabolism and immunometabolism by promoting the functions of <i>Phascolarctobacteriu</i> and <i>Alistipes</i>.

Both weight gain rate (WGR) and specific growth rate (SGR) in the MR group were obviously lower than the C group, and the intraperitoneal fat (IPF) in the MR group was obviously enhanced than HL and C groups, which led to more visible growth inhibition and lipid deposition. By using the scRNA-seq analysis, nine cell types were classified as: liver parenchymal cells, erythrocytes, hepatic stellate cells, cholangiocytes, macrophages, T cells, epidermal cells, eosinophil and fibroblasts. Lipid and carbohydrate metabolisms were mainly enriched in liver parenchymal cells. The lipid degradation pathways were obviously inhibited in the MR group, such as cholesterol degradation pathway. The lipid degradation genes were obviously decreased in the MR group. In conclusion, methionine restriction might suppress the lipid degradation pathways in liver parenchymal cells, led to obvious lipid deposition.",Zhang J; Zhou Y; Liao C; Gao W; Tan B; Chi S,Genomics,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39536957/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39520542,BCAS2 and hnRNPH1 orchestrate alternative splicing for DNA double-strand break repair and synapsis in meiotic prophase I.,"Understanding the intricacies of homologous recombination during meiosis is crucial for reproductive biology. However, the role of alternative splicing (AS) in DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair and synapsis remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the impact of conditional knockout (cKO) of the splicing factor gene Bcas2 in mouse germ cells, revealing impaired DSBs repair and synapsis, resulting in non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA). Employing crosslinking immunoprecipitation and sequencing (CLIP-seq), we globally mapped BCAS2 binding sites in the testis, uncovering its predominant association with 5' splice sites (5'SS) of introns and a preference for GA-rich regions. Notably, BCAS2 exhibited direct binding and regulatory influence on Trp53bp1 (codes for 53BP1) and Six6os1 through AS, unveiling novel insights into DSBs repair and synapsis during meiotic prophase I. Furthermore, the interaction between BCAS2, hnRNPH1, and SRSF3 was discovered to orchestrate Trp53bp1 expression via AS, underscoring its role in meiotic prophase I DSBs repair. In summary, our findings delineate the indispensable role of BCAS2-mediated post-transcriptional regulation in DSBs repair and synapsis during male meiosis. This study provides a comprehensive framework for unraveling the molecular mechanisms governing the post-transcriptional network in male meiosis, contributing to the broader understanding of reproductive biology.",Sun L; Ye R; Cao C; Lv Z; Wang C; Xie X; Chen X; Yao X; Tian S; Yan L; Shao Y; Cui S; Chen C; Xue Y; Li L; Chen J; Liu J,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39520542/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39519563,Coffee and Risk of Pancreatic Cancer: Insights from Two-Sample and Multivariable Mendelian Randomization Analyses.,"The association between coffee and pancreatic cancer risk has reported inconsistent results. Therefore, a Mendelian randomization (MR) study was undertaken to investigate the association between coffee and pancreatic cancer from a genetic perspective. In East Asian and European populations, independent genetic variants strongly associated with coffee were chosen as instrumental variables (IVs) from relevant genome-wide association studies (GWASs). GWAS data for pancreatic cancer were obtained from the JENGER (Japanese Encyclopedia of Genetic Associations by Riken) project and GWAS catalog database. Two-sample (TSMR) and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) analyses were conducted to investigate the genetically predicted causal relationship between coffee consumption and pancreatic cancer. A fixed-effect meta-analysis was employed to aggregate estimates from the two populations to reveal the overall association. Both in East Asian and European populations, an increase in coffee intake of a cup per day was not associated with pancreatic cancer risk, regardless of coffee type (including caffeine drinks, instant coffee, decaffeinated coffee, ground coffee, etc.). The results aligned with the findings of the meta-analysis (OR = 1.100, 95%CI = 0.862-1.403, <i>p</i> = 0.450). Also, for coffee intake with positive results in the TSMR analysis (OR = 1.739, 95%CI 1.104-2.739, <i>p</i> = 0.017), consistent negative results were observed after adjusting for potential confounders (smoking traits, drinking, type 2 diabetes, body mass index) in the MVMR analyses.

39519516,Interaction of CETP rs708272 Polymorphism on Trans Fatty Acid Intake and Glucose Metabolism Markers.,"Dietary fats influence gene expression and several metabolic pathways. Therefore, it is crucial to study the role of personal genotypes in the interaction between fat consumption and cardiometabolic markers. This research aimed to determine the interaction of the rs708272 polymorphism of <i>CETP</i> and the fatty acid intake with changes in the HOMA-IR in adults living with overweight or obesity. The current study was a secondary analysis of an 8-week controlled clinical trial. The final sample for this analysis comprised 78 Mexican adults with the Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein (<i>CETP)</i> rs708272 polymorphism who followed a dietary intervention. Using an interaction analysis, we evaluated the fatty acid intake and the genotypes of rs708272, with changes in blood glucose, insulin, and the HOMA-IR from baseline to endpoint. Our findings suggest a significant interaction between the trans fatty acid intake and the GG genotype with changes in glucose (<i>p</i> = 0.024), insulin (<i>p</i> = 0.004), and the HOMA-IR (<i>p</i> = 0.002). The higher the consumption of trans fatty acids, the less these markers of glucose metabolism were reduced. carriers of the GG genotype may benefit from limiting dietary trans fatty acid intake, as there was no reduction in plasma glucose and insulin despite a hypocaloric dietary intervention in adults with overweight and obesity.",Mendivil EJ; Barcenas-Rivera G; Ramos-Lopez O; Hernández-Guerrero C; Rivera-Iñiguez I; Pérez-Beltrán YE,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39519516/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39505926,GDF15 is required for maintaining subcutaneous adipose tissue lipid metabolic signature.,"Recent research has identified growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) as a crucial factor in various physiological and pathological processes, particularly in energy balance regulation. While the role of GDF15 in modulating energy metabolism through hindbrain GDNF family receptor alpha-like (GFRAL) signaling has been extensively studied, emerging evidence suggests direct peripheral metabolic actions of GDF15. Using knockout mouse models, we investigated GDF15 and GFRAL's roles in adipose tissue metabolism. Our findings indicate that C57BL/6/129/SvJ Gdf15-KO mice exhibit impaired expression of de novo lipogenesis enzymes in subcutaneous adipose tissue (sWAT). In contrast, C57BL/6J Gfral-KO mice showed no impairments compared to wild-type (WT) littermates. RNA-Seq analysis of sWAT in Gdf15-KO mice revealed a broad downregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism. Importantly, our study uncovered sex-specific effects, with females being more affected by GDF15 loss than males. Additionally, we observed a fasting-induced upregulation of GDF15 gene expression in sWAT of both mice and humans, reinforcing this factor's role in adipose tissue lipid metabolism. In conclusion, our research highlights an essential role for GDF15 in sWAT lipid metabolic homeostasis. These insights enhance our understanding of GDF15's functions in adipose tissue physiology and underscore its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic disorders.",Igual-Gil C; Bishop CA; Jähnert M; Johann K; Coleman V; Baum V; Kruse M; Pfeiffer AFH; Pivovarova-Ramich O; Ost M; Kleinert M; Klaus S,Scientific reports,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39505926/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39481358,"DNA Methylation and Non-Coding RNAs in Metabolic Disorders: Epigenetic Role of Nutrients, Dietary Patterns, and Weight Loss Interventions for Precision Nutrition.","Dysregulation of epigenetic processes and abnormal epigenetic profiles are associated with various metabolic disorders. Nutrition, as an environmental factor, can induce epigenetic changes through both direct exposure and transgenerational inheritance, continuously altering gene expression and shaping the phenotype. Nutrients consumed through food or supplementation, such as vitamin B12, folate, vitamin B6, and choline, play a pivotal role in DNA methylation, a critical process for gene regulation. Additionally, there is mounting evidence that the expression of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) can be modulated by the intake of specific nutrients and natural compounds, thereby influencing processes involved in the onset and progression of metabolic diseases. Evidence suggests that dietary patterns, weight loss interventions, nutrients and nutritional bioactive compounds can modulate the expression of various microRNA (miRNAs) and DNA methylation levels, contributing to the development of metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, several studies have proposed that DNA methylation and miRNA expression could serve as biomarkers for the effects of weight loss programs. Despite ongoing debate regarding the effects of nutrient supplementation on DNA methylation levels and the expression of ncRNAs, certain DNA methylation marks and ncRNA expressions might predict the risk of metabolic disorders and act as biomarkers for forecasting the success of therapies within the framework of precision medicine and nutrition. The role of DNA methylation and miRNA expression as potential mediators of the effects of weight loss underscores their potential as biomarkers for the outcomes of weight loss programs. This highlights the influence of dietary patterns and weight loss interventions on the regulation of miRNA expression and DNA methylation levels, suggesting an interaction between these epigenetic factors and the body's response to weight loss.",Nicoletti CF; Assmann TS; Souza LL; Martinez JA,Lifestyle genomics,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39481358/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39468772,Comparative assessment of phenotypic markers in patients with chronic inflammation: Differences on Bifidobacterium concerning liver status.,"The relationship between systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and low-grade metabolic inflammation (MI) with the microbiota is crucial for understanding the pathogenesis of these diseases and developing effective therapeutic interventions. In this context, it has been observed that the gut microbiota plays a key role in the immune regulation and inflammation contributing to the exacerbation through inflammatory mediators. This research aimed to describe similarities/differences in anthropometric, biochemical, inflammatory, and hepatic markers as well as to examine the putative role of gut microbiota concerning two inflammatory conditions: SLE and MI. Data were obtained from a cohort comprising adults with SLE and MI. Faecal samples were determined by 16S technique. Statistical analyses compared anthropometric and clinical variables, and LEfSe and MetagenomeSeq were used for metagenomic data. An interaction analysis was fitted to investigate associations of microbiota with fatty liver index (FLI) depending on the inflammatory condition. Participants with low-grade MI showed worse values in anthropometry and biochemicals compared with patients with SLE. The liver profile of patients with MI was unhealthier, while no relevant differences were found in most of the inflammatory markers between groups. LEfSe analysis revealed an overrepresentation of Bifidobacteriaceae family in SLE group. An interactive association between gut Bifidobacterium abundance and type of disease was identified for FLI values, suggesting an effect modification of the gut microbiota concerning liver markers depending on the inflammatory condition. This study found phenotypical and microbial similarities and disparities between these two inflammatory conditions, evidenced in clinical and hepatic markers, and showed the interactive interplay between gut Bifidobacterium and liver health (measured by FLI) that occur in a different manner depending on the type of inflammatory disease. These results underscore the importance of personalized approaches and individual microbiota in the screening of different inflammatory situations, considering unique hepatic and microbiota profiles.",Chero-Sandoval L; Higuera-Gómez A; Martínez-Urbistondo M; Castejón R; Mellor-Pita S; Moreno-Torres V; de Luis D; Cuevas-Sierra A; Martínez JA,European journal of clinical investigation,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39468772/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39467522,Barriers in Translating Existing Nutrigenetics Insights to Precision Nutrition for Cardiometabolic Health in Ethnically Diverse Populations.,"Cardiometabolic diseases pose a significant threat to global public health, with a substantial majority of cardiovascular disease mortality (more than three-quarters) occurring in low- and middle-income countries. There have been remarkable advances in recent years in identifying genetic variants that alter disease susceptibility by interacting with dietary factors. Despite the remarkable progress, several factors need to be considered before the translation of nutrigenetics insights to personalised and precision nutrition in ethnically diverse populations. Some of these factors include variations in genetic predispositions, cultural and lifestyle factors as well as socio-economic factors. This review aimed to explore the factors that need to be considered in bridging the gap between existing nutrigenetics insights and the implementation of personalised and precision nutrition across diverse ethnicities. Several factors might influence variations among individuals with regard to dietary exposures and metabolic responses, and these include genetic diversity, cultural and lifestyle factors as well as socio-economic factors. A multi-omics approach involving disciplines such as metabolomics, epigenetics, and the gut microbiome might contribute to improved understanding of the underlying mechanisms of gene-diet interactions and the implementation of precision nutrition although more research is needed to confirm the practicality and effectiveness of this approach. Conducting gene-diet interaction studies in diverse populations is essential and studies utilising large sample sizes are required as this improves the power to detect interactions with minimal effect sizes. Future studies should focus on replicating initial findings to enhance reliability and promote comparison across studies. Once findings have been replicated in independent samples, dietary intervention studies will be required to further strengthen the evidence and facilitate their application in clinical practice. Nutrigenetics has a potential role to play in the prevention and management of cardiometabolic diseases. Conducting gene-diet interaction studies in diverse populations is essential giving the genetic diversity and variations in dietary patterns. Integrating data from disciplines such as metabolomics, epigenetics, and the gut microbiome could help in early identification of individuals at risk of cardiometabolic diseases as well as the implementation of precise dietary interventions for preventing and managing cardiometabolic diseases.",Wuni R; Vimaleswaran KS,Lifestyle genomics,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39467522/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We previously engineered a recombinant <i>Lactococcus lactis</i> strain expressing the Ling-Zhi immunomodulatory protein (<i>L. lactis</i>-LZ8). This study investigated the anti-atherosclerotic effects of <i>L. lactis</i>-LZ8 in rabbits fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Changes in body weight, serum lipid profiles, and liver function were monitored. The aorta and liver tissues were analyzed for gross pathology and histopathology. Eight-week administration of <i>L. lactis</i>-LZ8 with HFD ameliorated atherosclerosis by downregulating protein and gene expression associated with lipid metabolism and inflammation in the aortas. The rabbits receiving <i>L. lactis</i>-LZ8 exhibited a significant dose-dependent reduction in hepatic fat accumulation. RNA sequencing of the livers revealed that inflammatory genes in the <i>L. lactis</i>-LZ8 groups were downregulated compared to the HFD group. Disease ontology enrichment analysis indicated that these genes were involved in atherosclerosis. Gene set enrichment analysis plots revealed significant enrichment in the gene sets related to cholesterol homeostasis. CIBERSORT immune cell fraction analysis indicated significant infiltration by regulatory T cells, CD8+ T cells, activated dendritic cells, and natural killer cells in the <i>L. lactis</i>-LZ8 group.

39418223,Gut microbiota determines the fate of dietary fiber-targeted interventions in host health.,"Epidemiological investigation confirmed that the intake of dietary fiber (DF) is closely related to human health, and the most important factor affecting the physiological function of DF, besides its physicochemical properties, is the gut microbiota. This paper mainly summarizes the interaction between DF and gut microbiota, including the influence of DF on the colonization of gut microbiota based on its different physicochemical properties, and the physiological role of gut microbiota in destroying the complex molecular structure of DF by encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes, thus producing small molecular products that affect the metabolism of the host. Taking cardiovascular disease (Atherosclerosis and hypertension), liver disease, and immune diseases as examples, it is confirmed that some DF, such as fructo-oligosaccharide, galactooligosaccharide, xylo-oligosaccharide, and inulin, have prebiotic-like physiological effects. These effects are dependent on the metabolites produced by the gut microbiota. Therefore, this paper further explores how DF affects the gut microbiota's production of substances such as short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, and tryptophan metabolites, and provides a preliminary explanation of the mechanisms associated with their impact on host health. Finally, based on the structural properties of DF and the large heterogeneity in the composition of the population gut microbiota, it may be a future trend to utilize DF and the gut microbiota to correlate host health for precision nutrition by combining the information from population disease databases.",Wang W; Fan Z; Yan Q; Pan T; Luo J; Wei Y; Li B; Fang Z; Lu W,Gut microbes,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39418223/,1,0,0,0,0,0

In this study, IgY was embedded in a W/O/W emulsion to overcome the digestive barrier and to investigate the protective effect of IgY against LPS-induced enteritis in mice. Four different hydrophilic emulsifiers (T80, PC, SC, and WPI) were selected to prepare separate W/O/W emulsions for encapsulating IgY. The results showed that the IgY-embedded double emulsion in the WPI group was the most effective. IgY embedded in the W/O/W emulsion could reduce the damage of LPS to the mouse intestine and prevent LPS-induced intestinal mucosal damage in mice. It increased the number of cup cells, promoted the expression of Muc2, and increased the mRNA expression levels of <i>KLF3</i>, <i>TFF3</i>, <i>Itln1</i>, and <i>Ang4</i> (<i>p</i> < 0.05). It also enhanced the antioxidant capacity of the colon tissue, reduced the level of inflammatory factors in the colon tissue, and protected the integrity of the colon tissue.

39396839,Microbiota and other detrimental metabolites in colorectal cancer.,"Increasing scientific evidence demonstrates that gut microbiota plays an essential role in the onset and development of Colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the mechanisms by which these microorganisms contribute to cancer development are complex and far from completely clarified. Specifically, the impact of gut microbiota-derived metabolites on CRC is undeniable, exerting both protective and detrimental effects. This paper examines the effects and mechanisms by which important bacterial metabolites exert detrimental effects associated with increased risk of CRC. Metabolites considered include heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heme iron, secondary bile acids, ethanol, and aromatic amines. It is necessary to delve deeper into the mechanisms of action of these metabolites in CRC and identify the microbiota members involved in their production. Furthermore, since diet is the main factor capable of modifying the intestinal microbiota, conducting studies that include detailed descriptions of dietary interventions is crucial.

39386242,Hybridization promotes growth performance by altering rumen microbiota and metabolites in sheep.,"Hybridization can substantially improve growth performance. This study used metagenomics and metabolome sequencing to examine whether the rumen microbiota and its metabolites contributed to this phenomenon. We selected 48 approximately 3 month-old male ♂Hu × ♀Hu (HH, <i>n</i> = 16), ♂Poll Dorset × ♀Hu (DH, <i>n</i> = 16), and ♂Southdown × ♀Hu (SH, <i>n</i> = 16) lambs having similar body weight. The sheep were fed individually under the same nutritional and management conditions for 95 days. After completion of the trial, seven sheep close to the average weight per group were slaughtered to collect rumen tissue and content samples to measure rumen epithelial parameters, fermentation patterns, microbiota, and metabolite profiles. The final body weight (FBW), average daily gain (ADG), and dry matter intake (DMI) values in the DH and SH groups were significantly higher and the feed-to-gain ratio (F/G) significantly lower than the value in the HH group; additionally, the papilla height in the DH group was higher than that in the HH group. Acetate, propionate, and total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations in the DH group were higher than those in the HH group, whereas NH<sub>3</sub>-N concentration decreased in the DH and SH groups. Metagenomic analysis revealed that several <i>Prevotella</i> and <i>Fibrobacter</i> species were significantly more abundant in the DH group, contributing to an increased ability to degrade dietary cellulose and enrich their functions in enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown. <i>Bacteroidaceae bacterium</i> was higher in the SH group, indicating a greater ability to digest dietary fiber. Metabolomic analysis revealed that the concentrations of rumen metabolites (mainly lysophosphatidylethanolamines [LPEs]) were higher in the DH group, and microbiome-related metabolite analysis indicated that <i>Treponema bryantii</i> and <i>Fibrobacter succinogenes</i> were positively correlated with the LPEs. Moreover, we found methionine sulfoxide and N-methyl-4-aminobutyric acid were characteristic metabolites in the DH and SH groups, respectively, and are related to oxidative stress, indicating that the environmental adaptability of crossbred sheep needs to be further improved. These findings substantially deepen the general understanding of how hybridization promotes growth performance from the perspective of rumen microbiota, this is vital for the cultivation of new species and the formulation of precision nutrition strategies for sheep.",Zhang R; Zhang L; An X; Li J; Niu C; Zhang J; Geng Z; Xu T; Yang B; Xu Z; Yue Y,Frontiers in veterinary science,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39386242/,0,0,0,0,0,0

We hypothesized that there is a significant association. Data from the NHANES (2017-2020) were analyzed to explore IO's impact on MASLD and hepatic fibrosis in U.S. adults. We assessed serum ferritin, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), liver stiffness measurement (LSM), and various covariates. Gene expression data were sourced from the FerrDb V2 and GEO databases. Differential gene expression analysis, Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Network construction, and Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed. The study verified the link between MASLD, hepatic fibrosis, and iron overload hub genes. This study of 5927 participants, averaging 46.78 years of age, revealed significant correlations between serum ferritin and CAP, LSM, after adjusting for covariates. Threshold effect analysis indicated nonlinear associations between serum ferritin and CAP, LSM, with distinct patterns observed by age and gender. Moreover, the area under the ROC curve for serum ferritin with MASLD and hepatic fibrosis was 0.8272 and 0.8376, respectively, demonstrating its performance in assessing these conditions. Additionally, molecular analyses identified potential hub genes associated with iron overload and MASLD, and hepatic fibrosis, revealing the underlying mechanisms. Our study findings reveal an association between iron overload, MASLD, and hepatic fibrosis. Additionally, the hub genes may be implicated in iron overload and subsequently contribute to the progression of MASLD and hepatic fibrosis.

The research emphasizes the potential of using machine learning techniques to analyze complex microbiome datasets, providing a non-invasive approach to identifying CRC-related microbial markers.<b>Hypothesis/Gap Statement.</b> The primary hypothesis is that a robust machine learning-based analysis of 16S rRNA microbiome data can identify specific microbial features that serve as effective biomarkers for CRC detection, overcoming the limitations of classical statistical models in high-dimensional settings.<b>Aim.</b> The primary objective of this study is to explore and validate the potential of the human microbiome, specifically in the colon, as a valuable source of biomarkers for colorectal cancer (CRC) detection and progression. The focus is on developing a classifier that effectively predicts the presence of CRC and normal samples based on the analysis of three previously published faecal 16S rRNA sequencing datasets.<b>Methodology.</b> To achieve the aim, various machine learning techniques are employed, including random forest (RF), recursive feature elimination (RFE) and a robust correlation-based technique known as the fuzzy forest (FF). The study utilizes these methods to analyse the three datasets, comparing their performance in predicting CRC and normal samples. The emphasis is on identifying the most relevant microbial features (taxa) associated with CRC development via partial dependence plots, i.e. a machine learning tool focused on explainability, visualizing how a feature influences the predicted outcome.<b>Results.</b> The analysis of the three faecal 16S rRNA sequencing datasets reveals the consistent and superior predictive performance of the FF compared to the RF and RFE. Notably, FF proves effective in addressing the correlation problem when assessing the importance of microbial taxa in explaining the development of CRC. The results highlight the potential of the human microbiome as a non-invasive means to detect CRC and underscore the significance of employing FF for improved predictive accuracy.<b>Conclusion.</b> In conclusion, this study underscores the limitations of classical statistical techniques in handling high-dimensional information such as human microbiome data. The research demonstrates the potential of the human microbiome, specifically in the colon, as a valuable source of biomarkers for CRC detection. Applying machine learning techniques, particularly the FF, is a promising approach for building a classifier to predict CRC and normal samples. The findings advocate for integrating FF to overcome the challenges associated with correlation when identifying crucial microbial features linked to CRC development.",Porreca A; Ibrahimi E; Maturo F; Marcos Zambrano LJ; Meto M; Lopes MB,Journal of medical microbiology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39377779/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39366243,A gold nanoparticle-enhanced dCas9-mediated fluorescence resonance energy transfer for nucleic acid detection.,"Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated Cas proteins coupled with pre-amplification have shown great potential in molecular diagnoses. However, the current CRISPR-based methods require additional reporters and time-consuming process. Herein, a gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-enhanced CRISPR/dCas9-mediated fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) termed Au-CFRET platform was proposed for rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of nucleic acid for the first time. In the Au-CFRET sensing platform, AuNP was functionalized with dCas9 and used as nanoprobe. Target DNA was amplified with FAM-labeled primers and then precisely bound with AuNP-dCas9. The formed complex rendered the distance between AuNP acceptor and FAM donor to be short enough for the occurrence of FRET, thus resulting in fluorescence quenching. Moreover, AuNPs were demonstrated to enhance binding efficiency of dCas9 to target DNA in Au-CFRET system. The key factors regarding the FRET efficiency were analyzed and characterized in detail, including the length of donor/acceptor and the size of AuNPs. Under the optimal conditions, Au-CFRET could determinate CaMV35S promoter of genetically modified rice as low as 21 copies μL<sup>-1</sup>. Moreover, Au-CFRET sensing system coupled with one-step extraction and recombinase polymerase amplification can identify the genuine plant seeds within 30 min from sampling to results at room/body temperature without expensive equipment or technical expertise, and requires no additional exogenous reporters. Therefore, the proposed sensing platform significantly simplified the system and shortened the assay time for nucleic acid diagnoses.",Yang Y; Zhai S; Zhang L; Wu Y; Li J; Li Y; Li X; Zhu L; Xu W; Wu G; Gao H,Talanta,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39366243/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39353276,Characterization of a novel antioxidant exopolysaccharide from an intestinal-originated bacteria Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum Bi-OTA128.,"Microbial exopolysaccharides (EPSs) have attracted extensive attention for their biological functions in antioxidant activities. In this study, we characterized a novel EPS produced by Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum Bi-OTA128 which exhibited the highest antioxidant capacity compared to nine other ropy bacterial strains, achieving 76.50 % and 93.84 % in DPPH· and ABTS·<sup>+</sup> scavenging activity, and ferric reducing power of 134.34 μM Fe<sup>2+</sup>. Complete genomic analysis identified an eps gene cluster involved in the EPS biosynthesis of Bi-OTA128 strain, which might be responsible for its ropy phenotype. The EPS was then isolated and purified by a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column. A single elution part EPS<sub>128</sub> was obtained with a recovery rate of 43.5 ± 1.78 % and a total carbohydrate content of 93.6 ± 0.76 %. Structural characterization showed that EPS<sub>128</sub> comprised glucose, galactose, and rhamnose (molar ratio 4.0:1.2:1.1), featuring a putative complex backbone structure with four branched chains and an unusual acetyl group at O-2 of terminal rhamnose. Antioxidant assay in vitro indicated that EPS<sub>128</sub> exhibited antioxidant potential with 50.52 % DPPH· and 65.40 % ABTS·<sup>+</sup> scavenging activities, reaching 54.3 % and 70.44 % of the efficacy of standard Vitamin C at 2.0 mg/L. Furthermore, EPS<sub>128</sub> showed protective effects against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress in HepG2 cells by reducing cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increasing cell viability. These findings present the first comprehensive report of an antioxidant EPS from B. pseudocatenulatum, highlighting its potential as a natural antioxidant for applications in the food industry and clinical settings.",Wang H; Lu F; Feng X; Zhang Y; Di W; Chen M; Wu R; Rao M; Yin P; Hao Y; Zhai Z,Microbiological research,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39353276/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39349773,Identification of proteins associated with type 2 diabetes risk in diverse racial and ethnic populations.,"Several studies have reported associations between specific proteins and type 2 diabetes risk in European populations. To better understand the role played by proteins in type 2 diabetes aetiology across diverse populations, we conducted a large proteome-wide association study using genetic instruments across four racial and ethnic groups: African; Asian; Hispanic/Latino; and European. Genome and plasma proteome data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study involving 182 African, 69 Asian, 284 Hispanic/Latino and 409 European individuals residing in the USA were used to establish protein prediction models by using potentially associated cis- and trans-SNPs. The models were applied to genome-wide association study summary statistics of 250,127 type 2 diabetes cases and 1,222,941 controls from different racial and ethnic populations. We identified three, 44 and one protein associated with type 2 diabetes risk in Asian, European and Hispanic/Latino populations, respectively. Meta-analysis identified 40 proteins associated with type 2 diabetes risk across the populations, including well-established as well as novel proteins not yet implicated in type 2 diabetes development. Our study improves our understanding of the aetiology of type 2 diabetes in diverse populations.

39339679,Interindividual Variability in Postprandial Plasma Fructose Patterns in Adults.,"High fructose consumption is associated with an increased risk of cardiometabolic disease, and fructose feeding dose-dependently induces markers reflective of poor metabolic health. However, unlike glucose, surprisingly little is known about person-to-person differences in postprandial plasma fructose patterns. Herein, we performed post hoc analyses of two published studies to address this question. In the first cohort, 16 participants' all-day plasma fructose concentration patterns (08:00-23:30) were determined (8 women and 8 men) while consuming mixed meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) with a fructose-sweetened beverage at each meal (30% of calories). Individually plotted results demonstrate remarkably disparate fructose patterns with respect to peak concentration and timing. A secondary study confirmed substantial interindividual variability in plasma fructose patterns over 240 min in 16 adults consuming Ensure<sup>®</sup>, a commercially available mixed macronutrient drink containing a low dose of fructose. The health ramifications of interindividual variations in postprandial fructose metabolism and the underlying physiological mechanisms driving differences in post-meal blood patterns remain to be explored. Future research is warranted to determine if interindividual variability in fructose digestion, metabolism, and postprandial blood concentration patterns is associated with cardiometabolic health phenotypes and disease risk.",Gladding M; Shen X; Snyder MP; Havel PJ; Adams SH,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39339679/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39332361,Structural characteristics and nonvolatile metabolites of theabrownins and their impact on intestinal microbiota in high-fat-diet-fed mice.,"This study prepared enzymatic theabrownins (TBs-e), alkaline theabrownins (TBs-a), and Pu-erh tea theabrownins (TBs-f), and investigated whether different preparation processes affected the structures, nonvolatile metabolites, and biofunctional activities of TBs. Structural characterization revealed that TBs were polymeric phenolic compounds rich in hydroxyl and carboxyl groups. Nontargeted metabolomics revealed that amino acids were the primary nonvolatile metabolites in TBs-e and TBs-a, accounting for over 70 % of the total nonvolatile content. TBs-f contained more polyphenols, caffeine, and flavonoids, accounting for 14.2 %, 3.9 %, and 0.8 % of total nonvolatile content, respectively. In vivo, at 560 mg/kg body weight, TBs-f were associated with regulation of blood glucose and lipid concentrations in mice. Moreover, 16S rRNA indicated that at 1120 mg/kg body weight, TBs-a were associated with increased numbers of microbiota linked with hypolipidemic activity. This study explores the impacts of different preparation processes on TBs and provides a theoretical foundation for the understanding of TBs.",Zhang F; Wang Y; Wang M; Tan C; Huang S; Mou H; Wu K; Peng L; Fang Z; Tian Y; Sheng J; Zhao C,Food chemistry,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39332361/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39297407,PARN Maintains RNA Stability to Regulate Insulin Maturation and GSIS in Pancreatic β Cells.,"Diabetes, a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia, underscores the importance of normal pancreatic β-cell development and function in maintaining glucose homeostasis. Poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) serves as the principal regulator of messenger RNA (mRNA) stability, yet its specific role in pancreatic β cells remains unclear. This study utilizes mice with targeted PARN deficiency in β cells to elucidate this role. Notably, Parn conditional knockout mice present unaltered β-cell development and insulin sensitivity but reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). The observed outcomes are corroborated in NIT-1 cells. Furthermore, transcriptomic analyses reveal aberrant mRNA expression of genes crucial for insulin secretion in PARN-deficient β cells. Insights from linear amplification of complementary DNA ends and sequencing and coimmunoprecipitation experiments reveal an interaction between PARN and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1), regulating the RNA stability of solute carrier family 30, member 8 (Slc30a8) and carbohydrate sulfotransferase 3 (Chst3). Interference with either PARN or PTBP1 disrupts this stability. These data indicate that PARN deficiency hampers GSIS and insulin maturation by destabilizing Slc30a8 and Chst3 RNAs. These findings provide compelling evidence indicating that PARN is a potential therapeutic target for enhancing insulin maturation and secretion.",Xie X; Chen X; Wang C; Sun L; Yu W; Lv Z; Tian S; Yao X; Wang F; Ding D; Chen J; Liu J,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39297407/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39300419,Personalized sleep and nutritional strategies to combat adverse effects of night shift work: a controlled intervention protocol.,"Working during the night interferes with the timing of normal daily activities and is associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases. Under controlled experimental conditions, interventions focusing on sleep and nutrition can mitigate the short-term adverse effects of shift work. However, it is unclear how these results translate to real-life, how they can be targeted to individual conditions, and how they relate to long-term health. Therefore, the current study aims to implement a personalized sleep and nutritional intervention among night shift workers in the field. A non-blinded controlled intervention study is used, consisting of a run-in period, an intervention of 3 months, post-intervention measurements, and a follow-up after 12 months. Three study arms are included: sleep intervention, nutritional intervention, and control group (n = 25 each). Participants are healthy 18-60-year male night shift workers, with at least one year of experience in night shift work. Information from the run-in period will be used to personalize the interventions. The main outcomes are sleep measurements and continuous interstitial glucose levels. Furthermore, general health biomarkers and parameters will be determined to further evaluate effects on long-term health. This study aims to mitigate negative health consequences associated with night shift work by introducing two personalized preventive interventions. If proven effective, the personalized interventions may serve as practical solutions that can have a meaningful impact on the sustainable health and employability of night shift workers. This study will thereby contribute to the current need for high-quality data on preventative strategies for night shift work in a real-life context.

39299473,"Association of MTHFR C677T, MTHFRA1298C, and MTRRA66G Gene Polymorphisms with Hyperhomocysteinemia and Its Modulation by the Combined Effect of Vitamin B12 and Folate in Chinese Population with Hypertension.","In China, the MTHFR 677T allele, unlike in most Western populations, is a rare genetic variant linked to various disorders. The contributing nutritional and genetic factors to this genetic risk remain unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the interactions between genetic variations in total homocysteine (tHcy) pathway genes, serum tHcy concentrations, and nutritional factors in a Chinese population with hypertension. This study analyzed 1304 Chinese adults with hypertension aged ≥18 y enrolled in the China Precision Nutrition and Health KAP Real World Study (CPNAS). Serum concentrations of vitamin B12 and folate were measured using the magnetic microparticle chemiluminescence method, and tHcy concentrations were measured using Hcy Assay kits. Identification of the MTHFR C677T, MTHFR A1298C, and MTRR A66G polymorphisms was performed via time-of-flight nucleic spectrometry. Our findings revealed significant sex differences in tHcy concentrations, with males exhibiting higher tHcy concentrations than females (13.95 μmol/L vs. 11.15 μmol/L, P < 0.001). Individuals deficient in both vitamin B12 and folate had an increased risk of hyperhomocysteinemia (H-Hcy) (57.4%). In contrast, the prevalence of H-Hcy was lower among those deficient in either vitamin B12 (31.1%) or folate (23.2%) alone. Significant associations were identified between the MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms and elevated serum tHcy concentrations, particularly in individuals homozygous for the T allele. Conversely, the MTRR A66G genotype did not show a significant correlation with tHcy concentrations. Optimal vitamin B12 concentrations significantly modulated the genotypic effect on tHcy concentrations, with individuals having adequate vitamin B12 and folate exhibiting low tHcy concentrations, even among high-risk genotypes (TT). Adequate concentrations of folate and vitamin B12 significantly reduce serum tHcy concentrations and mitigate the genotypic impact on tHcy concentrations, highlighting the potential for targeted nutritional interventions to manage cardiovascular risks associated with H-Hcy.

39283705,A Systematic Review of the Effect of Gene-Lifestyle Interactions on Metabolic-Disease-Related Traits in South Asian Populations.,"Recent data from the South Asian subregion have raised concern about the dramatic increase in the prevalence of metabolic diseases, which are influenced by genetic and lifestyle factors. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the contemporary evidence for the effect of gene-lifestyle interactions on metabolic outcomes in this population. PubMed, Web of Science, and SCOPUS databases were searched up until March 2023 for observational and intervention studies investigating the interaction between genetic variants and lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity on obesity and type 2 diabetes traits. Of the 14 783 publications extracted, 15 were deemed eligible for inclusion in this study. Data extraction was carried out independently by 3 investigators. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Appraisal Tool for Cross-Sectional Studies (AXIS), the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I), and the methodological quality score for nutrigenetics studies. Using a narrative synthesis approach, the findings were presented in textual and tabular format. Together, studies from India (n = 8), Pakistan (n = 3), Sri Lanka (n = 1), and the South Asian diaspora in Singapore and Canada (n = 3) reported 543 gene-lifestyle interactions, of which 132 (∼24%) were statistically significant. These results were related to the effects of the interaction of genetic factors with physical inactivity, poor sleep habits, smoking, and dietary intake of carbohydrates, protein, and fat on the risk of metabolic disease in this population. The findings of this systematic review provide evidence of gene-lifestyle interactions impacting metabolic traits within the South Asian population. However, the lack of replication and correction for multiple testing and the small sample size of the included studies may limit the conclusiveness of the evidence.

39207263,Predicting structure-targeted food bioactive compounds for middle-aged and elderly Asians with myocardial infarction: insights from genetic variations and bioinformatics-integrated deep learning analysis.,"Myocardial infarction (MI) is a significant global health issue. Despite the advances in genome-wide association studies, a complete genetic and molecular understanding of MI is elusive and needs to be fully explored. This study aimed to elucidate the genetic framework of MI and explore the potential health benefits of natural compounds (NCs). The genetic architecture of MI was explored using data from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study. We pinpointed crucial protein-coding genes related to MI by multi-marker analysis of genomic annotation for gene-based analysis. The bioinformatics-integrated deep neural analysis of NCs (BioDeepNat), a novel disease discovery application, was utilized to assess the influence of NCs on MI-related target proteins and validated with molecular docking analysis. The BioDeepNat application revealed significant NCs on MI-related target proteins, such as <i>E</i>-resveratrol, epicatechin 3-gallate, and kaempferol. The E3 region of RNF213 protein with a point mutation (Arg4810Lys) had different binding energies with NCs, such as ursolic acid and olean-12-en-28-oic acid, compared to the wild type. However, ginsenosides, eleutheroside, oleanolic acid, and hederagenin showed similar binding energies to wild and mutated types of <i>RNF213</i> protein. The predicted NCs were primarily sourced from foods such as common grapes and teas. Aromatic hydrocarbons are frequently observed as the prevalent functional groups with high binding affinity for NCs in a molecular docking analysis. In conclusion, the proteins encoded by these genes identified by gene-based analysis interacted with several NCs with health promotion found in day-to-day foods, particularly <i>E</i>-resveratrol and kaempferol.

39207124,Size matters: lower body weight pigs have a different response to immune challenge and amino acids supplementation above the estimated requirement compared to heavy pigs.,"The immune response varies between pigs, as not all pigs have the same response to a stressor. This variation may exist between individuals due to body weight (BW) or body composition, which may impact the capacity for coping with an immune challenge (IC). Tryptophan (Trp), threonine (Thr), and methionine (Met) requirements might also play a considerable part in supporting immune system activation while reducing variation between pigs; however, the latter has yet to be reported. This exploratory study investigated the effect of initial BW (light vs. heavy-weight) and supplementation of Trp, Thr, and Met above National Research Council (NRC) requirements on feeding behavior and the coping capacity of growing pigs under an IC. Eighty gilts were categorized into 2 groups according to BW: light-weight (LW, 22.5 kg) and heavy-weight pigs (HW, 28.5 kg). Both BW groups were group-housed for a 28-d trial in a good or poor sanitary condition (SC). Pigs within a poor SC were orally inoculated with 2 × 109 colony units of Salmonella Typhimurium, and fresh manure from a pig farm was spread on the floor. Pigs within good SC were not inoculated, nor was manure spread. Two diets were provided within each SC: control (CN) or supplemented (AA+) with Trp, Thr, and Met at 120% of NRC recommended levels. A principal component analysis was performed in R, and a feeding behavior index was calculated in SAS. Results showed that LW and HW pigs were clustered separately on day 0, where LW pigs had a positive correlation with body lipid percentage (r = 0.83), and HW pigs had a positive correlation with body protein percentage (r = 0.75). After the IC, the cluster configuration changed, with diets influencing LW more than HW pigs within poor SC. On day 14, LW fed AA + diet in poor SC was clustered separately from LW pigs fed CN diet, whereas LW fed AA + and CN diets in good SC were clustered together. For feeding behavior, in both analyzed periods (period 1: days 7 to 14; period 2: days 21 to 28), LW had lower total feed intake and shorter meals than HW pigs (P < 0.10), independent of the SC. Furthermore, LW pigs fed AA + diet had a more regular feed intake pattern than those fed CN diet, while a more irregular pattern was observed for HW pigs fed AA + diet than CN diet at period 2. These findings suggest that supplementing Trp, Thr, and Met above requirements may be a nutritional strategy for LW pigs under IC by improving feed intake regularity and reducing the probability of being susceptible to IC.",Valini GADC; Méthot S; Pomar C; Hauschild L; Remus A,Journal of animal science,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39207124/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39203789,Genes Involved in Susceptibility to Obesity and Emotional Eating Behavior in a Romanian Population.,"Obesity, a significant public health concern with high prevalence in both adults and children, is a complex disorder arising from the interaction of multiple genes and environmental factors. Advances in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and sequencing technologies have identified numerous polygenic causes of obesity, particularly genes involved in hunger, satiety signals, adipocyte differentiation, and energy expenditure. This study investigates the relationship between six obesity-related genes (<i>CLOCK, FTO, GHRL, LEP, LEPR, MC4R</i>) and their impact on BMI, WC, HC, WHR, and emotional eating behavior in 220 Romanian adults. Emotional eating was assessed using the validated Emotional Eating Questionnaire (EEQ). Our analysis revealed significant variability in obesity-related phenotypes and emotional eating behaviors across different genotypes. Specifically, <i>CLOCK/</i>CC, <i>FTO/</i>AA, and <i>LEP/</i>AA genotypes were strongly associated with higher obesity metrics and emotional eating scores, while <i>GHRL/</i>TT and <i>MC4R/</i>CC were linked to increased BMI and WHR. The interplay between genetic predisposition and emotional eating behavior significantly influenced BMI and WHR, indicating a complex relationship between genetic and behavioral factors. This study, the first of its kind in Romania, provides a foundation for targeted interventions to prevent and reduce obesity and suggests potential strategies for gene expression modulation to mitigate the effects of emotional eating. Adopting a 'One Health' approach by creating an evidence base derived from both human and animal studies is crucial for understanding how to control obesity.",Vranceanu M; Filip L; Hegheș SC; de Lorenzo D; Cozma-Petruț A; Ghitea TC; Stroia CM; Banc R; Mîrza OM; Miere D; Cozma V; Popa DS,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39203789/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39197527,Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) impair the intestinal epithelial barrier via STAT3 activation mediated by macrophages.,"Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are a spectrum of complex compounds widely found in processed foods and frequently consumed by humans. AGEs are implicated in impairing the intestinal barrier, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated the effects of three types of AGEs on gene expression of tight junctions (TJs) in colorectal epithelial HT-29 cells, and observed minimal alterations in TJs expression. Given the important role of subepithelial macrophages in regulating the intestinal barrier, we explored whether AGEs affect the intestinal barrier via the involvement of macrophages. Notably, a significant downregulation of TJs expression was observed when supernatants from AGEs-treated RAW264.7 macrophage cells were transferred to HT-29 cells. Further investigations indicated that AGEs increased IL-6 levels in RAW264.7 cells, subsequently triggering STAT3 activation and suppressing TJs expression in HT-29 cells. The role of STAT3 activation was confirmed by observing enhanced TJs expression in HT-29 cells following pretreatment with an inhibitor of STAT3 activation prior to the transfer of the conditioned medium.

39164015,Nutrigenetics and Nutritional Strategies in Systemic Arterial Hypertension: Evidence From a Scoping Review.,"Nutrition and genetics have individual roles in systemic arterial hypertension (SAH); however, they can interact, influencing the regulation of blood pressure (BP) levels. The aim of this study was to evaluate the available evidence regarding gene-nutrient interactions in modulating BP levels in adults with SAH. The review followed the recommendations of the Joanna Briggs Institute and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, reporting on 20 genes and 31 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), with 19 of them associated with BP variations. The most frequently evaluated SNPs were ACE rs4646994 and AT1R rs5186. Among the nutritional interventions, dietary sodium content was the focus of most studies (n = 11). Interactions with sodium consumption were observed for the following SNPs: KDM1A rs587168, EDNRB rs5351, LSS rs2254524, IRS1 rs1801278, KCNK9 rs6997709, ACE rs4646994, GNB3 rs5443, PPARG rs4684847, EDN1 rs5370, BCAT1 rs7961152, IL18 rs5744292, NOS3 rs2070744, and AT1R rs5186. In the presence of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, moderate alcohol consumption, and reduced sodium intake, the SNP AT2R rs11091046 was associated with a decrease in BP levels. Furthermore, the SNP MTHFR rs1801133 exhibited an interaction with riboflavin supplementation in affecting BP levels. The evidence regarding the interaction between genetics and diet on BP levels remains limited. Among the existing findings, an interaction was observed between sodium, calcium, riboflavin, and specific polymorphisms; however, the underlying mechanisms for these interactions have yet to be identified.

39097171,Dietary modulation of microRNAs in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.,"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing worldwide. Various molecular mechanisms have been proposed to interfere with the insulin signaling pathway. Recent advances in proteomics and genomics indicate that one such mechanism involves the post-transcriptional regulation of insulin signaling by microRNA (miRNA). These noncoding RNAs typically induce messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation or translational repression by interacting with the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of target mRNA. Dietary components and patterns, which can either enhance or impair the insulin signaling pathway, have been found to regulate miRNA expression in both in vitro and in vivo studies. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge of how dietary components influence the expression of miRNAs related to the control of the insulin signaling pathway and discusses the potential application of these findings in precision nutrition.",Capetini VC; Quintanilha BJ; Garcia BREV; Rogero MM,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39097171/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39053237,"Comprehensive analysis of butyric acid impact on immunology, histopathology, gene expression, and metabolomic responses in pacific shrimp experiencing cold stress.","In this study, our objective was to investigate the impact of dietary butyric acid (BA) on the homeostasis mechanism of Pacific shrimp under cold stress. Specifically, we analyzed its effects on immunity, antioxidant capacity, gene expression, and metabolomics response. To carry out this research, Litopenaeus vannamei were fed a diet supplemented with BA for 8 weeks. Following this feeding period, a total of 180 shrimp, with an average weight of 12.76 ± 0.38 g, were exposed to cold conditions, with the temperature decreasing from 28 °C to 14 °C within an hour. The results of our study revealed survival rates ranging from 90 % to 100 %. Shrimp that were fed a diet containing 1.5 % BA exhibited a significant increase in acid phosphatase (ACP) and alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activity. Conversely, the control groups showed an increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) activity. Shrimp that consumed diets containing 1.5 % BA displayed the lowest malondialdehyde (MDA) levels with the highest superoxide dismutase (SOD) content. The shrimp fed the BA diet exhibited tightly organized hepatic tubules with a star-shaped lumen filled with numerous B and R cells. Furthermore, shrimp fed the BA diet demonstrated a significant increase in caspase 3 (CASP) expression. There were no significant variations in the expression levels of prophenoloxidase (ProPO), manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) The metabolites of Dl-carnitine, acetyl-l-carnitine, propionylcarnitine, hexanoylcarnitine, palmitoylcarnitine, decanoylcarnitine, and Dl-carnitine exhibited significantly increased expression in shrimp that were fed BA, suggesting their role in the lipolysis process.

39013293,"Temporal variation in production performance, biochemical and oxidative stress markers, and gut microbiota in Pekin ducks during the late growth stage.","In the late growth stage of commercial Pekin ducks, a significant increase in feed intake and a decline in body weight gain have been observed, leading to impaired feed conversion efficiency. To address this issue, we investigated alterations in production performance, blood biochemical indices, ileum tissue architecture, and microbial community structure in Pekin ducks. The primary objective was to provide robust data supporting the improvement of meat duck production efficiency during the late growth stage (28-42-days-old). Forty 28-day-old Pekin ducks were randomly assigned to 8 replicates, with five ducks per replicate. The rearing period lasted 14 days, with feed and water provided ad libitum. Our findings indicated a significant increase in Pekin duck body and heart weights with advancing age (P < 0.05). Moreover, serum antioxidant enzyme and high-density lipoprotein concentrations significantly increased, whereas triglyceride levels decreased (P < 0.05). Notably, the height of the ileal villi was significantly reduced (P < 0.05). The microbial community structure of the ileum exhibited significant changes as ducks aged, accompanied by a substantial increase in microbial flora diversity, particularly with the formation of more tightly connected microbial network modules. Time-dependent enrichment was observed in microbial gene functions related to energy metabolism pathways. At the genus level, Sphingomonas and Subdoligranulum have emerged as crucial players in microbial differential functional pathways and network formation. These bacteria likely serve as the key driving factors in the dynamic microbial changes that occur in Pekin ducks over time. Overall, our findings suggest a potential decline in the absorption function of the small intestine and fat deposition performance of Pekin ducks during later growth stages, which may be attributed to the maturation and proliferation of the gut microbial community.",Liu Y; Wang X; Zeng D; Wang H; Ma Y; Zhao X; Guan Z; Ning Z; Qu L,Poultry science,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39013293/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38987751,"Evidence of gene-nutrient interaction association with waist circumference, cross-sectional analysis.","Waist circumference (WC) is a significant indicator of body adiposity and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity of cardiovascular diseases. Although, single nutrient intake and candidate genes were previously associated with WC. Little is known about WC association with overall diet quality, genetic risk score and gene-nutrient interaction. This study aims to investigate the influence of overall diet quality and multiple WC-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms on WC. In addition to investigating gene-nutrient interaction association with WC. This study explored cross-sectional data from two large sample-size studies, to provide reproducible results. As a representation of the UK population, the Airwave Health Monitoring Study (n = 6,502) and the UK-Biobank Cohort Study (n = 171,129) were explored for factors associated with WC. Diet quality was evaluated based on the Mellen Index for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Mellen-DASH). The genetic risk score for WC (GRS-Waist) was calculated by screening the population genotype for WC-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms. Multivariate linear regression models were built to explore WC association with diet quality and genetic risk score. Gene-nutrient interaction was explored by introducing the interaction term (GRS-Waist X Mellen-DASH score) to multivariate linear regression analysis. The prevalence of high WC (Female > 80 cm, Male > 94 cm) was 46.5% and 51.7% in both populations. Diet quality and genetic risk score of WC were significantly associated with WC. There was no evidence of interaction between GRS-Waist, DASH diet scores and nutrient intake on WC. This study's findings provided reproducible results on waist circumference association with diet and genetics and tested the possibility of gene-nutrient interaction. These reproducible results are successful in building the foundation for using diet and genetics for early identification of those at risk of having high WC and WC-associated diseases. In addition, evidence on gene-diet interactions on WC is limited and lacks replication, therefore our findings may guide future research in investigating this interaction and investigating its application in precision nutrition.",AlBaloul AH; Griffin J; Kopytek A; Elliott P; Frost G,BMC public health,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38987751/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38969159,Neutrophil extracellular traps promote immune escape in hepatocellular carcinoma by up-regulating CD73 through Notch2.,"Immune escape is the main reason that immunotherapy is ineffective in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, this study illustrates a pathway mediated by neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that can promote immune escape of HCC. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that NETs up-regulated CD73 expression through activating Notch2 mediated nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, promoting regulatory T cells (Tregs) infiltration to mediate immune escape of HCC. In addition, we found the similar results in mouse HCC models by hydrodynamic plasmid transfection. The treatment of deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) could inhibit the action of NETs and improve the therapeutic effect of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). In summary, our results revealed that targeting of NETs was a promising treatment to improve the therapeutic effect of anti-PD-1.",Yu Y; Zhang C; Dong B; Zhang Z; Li X; Huang S; Tang D; Jing X; Yu S; Zheng T; Wu D; Tai S,Cancer letters,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38969159/,0,0,0,0,0,0

In the ISA-Capital health survey, 901 individuals were interviewed and had socioeconomic, demographic, health characteristics, along with dietary information obtained through two 24-h recalls. Data on 12 components related to food groups, nutrients, and calories was combined into a diet quality score (BHEI-R). BHEI-R, SoFAAs (calories from added sugar, saturated fat, and alcohol) and Alcohol use were tested for associations with 255 TAS2R SNPs and 73 TAS1R SNPs for 637 individuals with regression analysis and Random Forest. Significant SNPs were combined into Genetic taste scores (GTSs). Among 23 SNPs significantly associated either by stepwise linear/logistic regression or random forest with any possible biological functionality, the missense variants rs149217752 in TAS2R40, for SoFAAs, and rs2233997 in TAS2R4, were associated with both BHEI-R (under 4% increase in Mean Squared Error) and SoFAAs. GTSs increased the variance explanation of quantitative phenotypes and there was a moderately high AUC for alcohol use. The study provides insights into the genetic basis of human taste perception through the identification of missense variants in the TAS2R gene family.

We aimed to assess whether including omics-based PN in an e-commerce tool improves dietary behavior and metabolic profile in general population. A 21-wk parallel, single-blinded, randomized intervention involved 193 adults assigned to a control group following Mediterranean diet recommendations (n = 57, completers = 36), PN (n = 70, completers = 45), or personalized plan (PP, n = 68, completers = 53) integrating a behavioral change program with PN recommendations. The intervention used metabolomics, proteomics, and genetic data to assist participants in creating personalized shopping lists in a simulated e-commerce retailer portal. The primary outcome was the Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS) score; secondary outcomes included biometric and metabolic markers and dietary habits. Volunteers were categorized with a scoring system based on biomarkers of lipid, carbohydrate metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, and microbiota, and dietary recommendations delivered accordingly in the PN and PP groups. The intervention significantly increased MEDAS scores in all volunteers (control-3 points; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.2, 3.8; PN-2.7 points; 95% CI: 2.0, 3.3; and PP-2.8 points; 95% CI: 2.1, 3.4; q < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in dietary habits or health parameters between PN and control groups after adjustment for multiple comparisons. Nevertheless, personalized recommendations significantly (false discovery rate < 0.05) and selectively enhanced the scores calculated with biomarkers of carbohydrate metabolism (β: -0.37; 95% CI: -0.56, -0.18), oxidative stress (β: -0.37; 95% CI: -0.60, -0.15), microbiota (β: -0.38; 95% CI: -0.63, -0.15), and inflammation (β: -0.78; 95% CI: -1.24, -0.31) compared with control diet. Integration of personalized strategies within an e-commerce-like tool did not enhance adherence to Mediterranean diet or improved health markers compared with general recommendations. The metabotyping approach showed promising results and more research is guaranteed to further promote its application in PN.

38913541,Gut microbial features and dietary fiber intake predict gut microbiota response to resistant starch supplementation.,"Resistant starch (RS) consumption can have beneficial effects on metabolic health, but the response, in terms of effects on the gut microbiota and host physiology, varies between individuals. Factors predicting the response to RS are not yet established and would be useful for developing precision nutrition approaches that maximize the benefits of dietary fiber intake. We sought to identify predictors of gut microbiota response to RS supplementation. We enrolled 76 healthy adults into a 7-week crossover study with 59 individuals completing the study. Participants consumed RS type 2 (RS2), RS type 4 (RS4), and digestible starch, for 10 d each with 5-d washout periods in between. We collected fecal and saliva samples and food records during each treatment period. We performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing and measured fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), salivary amylase (<i>AMY1</i>) gene copy number, and salivary amylase activity (SAA). Dietary fiber intake was predictive of the relative abundance of several amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) at the end of both RS treatments. <i>AMY1</i>-related metrics were not predictive of response to RS. SAA was only predictive of the relative abundance of one ASV after digestible starch supplementation. Interestingly, SCFA concentrations increased the most during digestible starch supplementation. Treatment order (the order of consumption of RS2 and RS4), alpha diversity, and a subset of ASVs were predictive of SCFA changes after RS supplementation. Based on our findings, dietary fiber intake and gut microbiome composition would be informative if assessed prior to recommending RS supplementation because these data can be used to predict changes in specific ASVs and fecal SCFA concentrations. These findings lay a foundation to support the premise that using a precision nutrition approach to optimize the benefits of dietary fibers such as RS could be an effective strategy to compensate for the low consumption of dietary fiber nationwide.",Devarakonda SLS; Superdock DK; Ren J; Johnson LM; Loinard-González AAP; Poole AC,Gut microbes,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38913541/,0,0,0,0,0,0

38901102,S-nitrosoglutathione reductase alleviates morphine analgesic tolerance by restricting PKCα S-nitrosation.,"Morphine, a typical opiate, is widely used for controlling pain but can lead to various side effects with long-term use, including addiction, analgesic tolerance, and hyperalgesia. At present, however, the mechanisms underlying the development of morphine analgesic tolerance are not fully understood. This tolerance is influenced by various opioid receptor and kinase protein modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Here, we established a murine morphine tolerance model to investigate whether and how S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) is involved in morphine tolerance. Repeated administration of morphine resulted in the down-regulation of GSNOR, which increased excessive total protein S-nitrosation in the prefrontal cortex. Knockout or chemical inhibition of GSNOR promoted the development of morphine analgesic tolerance and neuron-specific overexpression of GSNOR alleviated morphine analgesic tolerance. Mechanistically, GSNOR deficiency enhanced S-nitrosation of cellular protein kinase alpha (PKCα) at the Cys78 and Cys132 sites, leading to inhibition of PKCα kinase activity, which ultimately promoted the development of morphine analgesic tolerance. Our study highlighted the significant role of GSNOR as a key regulator of PKCα S-nitrosation and its involvement in morphine analgesic tolerance, thus providing a potential therapeutic target for morphine tolerance.",Su LY; Jiao L; Liu Q; Qiao X; Xie T; Ma Z; Xu M; Ye MS; Yang LX; Chen C; Yao YG,Redox biology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38901102/,0,0,0,0,0,0

The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to explore the association between the different genotypes of MC4R rs17782313 and energy intake and appetite. A literature search was conducted up to June 2023 in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Collaboration databases, following PRISMA guidelines. Inclusion criteria were studies in humans measuring energy intake, appetite, or satiety in all ages and physiological conditions. Studies dealing solely with body mass index were excluded. Twenty-one articles representing 48 560 participants were included in the meta-analysis. According to the NHLBI (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute) quality-assessment criteria, all case-control studies and 6 out of 17 cohort and cross-sectional studies were classified as ""good,"" while the rest scored as ""fair."" Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated in a (CT+CC) vs TT dominant model, and both random-effects and fixed-effects models were used. A statistically significant association between the presence of the C allele and increased appetite was found (OR = 1.25; 95% CI: 1.01-1.49; P = .038) using the fixed-effects model, but the random-effects model proved nonsignificant. However, no association with energy intake was found. None of the variables considered (sample size, year of publication, sex, age group, type of population, origin, and quality) were identified as effect modifiers, and no publication biases were found after subgroup and meta-regression analyses. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis that has analyzed the association between rs17782313 of MC4R and energy intake and appetite.

However, the precise function of Selenoi in the liver remains elusive. In the study, we generated hepatocyte-specific Selenoi conditional knockout (cKO) mice on a high-fat diet to identify the physiological function of Selenoi. The cKO group exhibited a significant increase in body weight, with a 15.6% and 13.7% increase in fat accumulation in white adipose tissue (WAT) and the liver, respectively. Downregulation of the lipolysis-related protein (p-Hsl) and upregulation of the adipogenesis-related protein (Fasn) were observed in the liver of cKO mice. The cKO group also showed decreased oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>), carbon dioxide production (VCO<sub>2</sub>), and energy expenditure (p < .05). Moreover, various metabolites of the steroid hormone synthesis pathway were affected in the liver of cKO mice. A potential cascade of Selenoi-phosphatidylethanolamine-steroid hormone synthesis might serve as a core mechanism that links hepatocyte-specific Selenoi cKO to biochemical and molecular reactions. In conclusion, we revealed that Selenoi inhibits body fat accumulation and hepatic steatosis and elevates energy consumption; this protein could also be considered a therapeutic target for such related diseases.",Huang X; Li T; Yang SH; Zhu KD; Wang LS; Dong YL; Huang JQ,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38837270/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38831751,Obesogenic High-Fat Diet and MYC Cooperate to Promote Lactate Accumulation and Tumor Microenvironment Remodeling in Prostate Cancer.,"Cancer cells exhibit metabolic plasticity to meet oncogene-driven dependencies while coping with nutrient availability. A better understanding of how systemic metabolism impacts the accumulation of metabolites that reprogram the tumor microenvironment (TME) and drive cancer could facilitate development of precision nutrition approaches. Using the Hi-MYC prostate cancer mouse model, we demonstrated that an obesogenic high-fat diet (HFD) rich in saturated fats accelerates the development of c-MYC-driven invasive prostate cancer through metabolic rewiring. Although c-MYC modulated key metabolic pathways, interaction with an obesogenic HFD was necessary to induce glycolysis and lactate accumulation in tumors. These metabolic changes were associated with augmented infiltration of CD206+ and PD-L1+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) and FOXP3+ regulatory T cells, as well as with the activation of transcriptional programs linked to disease progression and therapy resistance. Lactate itself also stimulated neoangiogenesis and prostate cancer cell migration, which were significantly reduced following treatment with the lactate dehydrogenase inhibitor FX11. In patients with prostate cancer, high saturated fat intake and increased body mass index were associated with tumor glycolytic features that promote the infiltration of M2-like TAMs. Finally, upregulation of lactate dehydrogenase, indicative of a lactagenic phenotype, was associated with a shorter time to biochemical recurrence in independent clinical cohorts. This work identifies cooperation between genetic drivers and systemic metabolism to hijack the TME and promote prostate cancer progression through oncometabolite accumulation. This sets the stage for the assessment of lactate as a prognostic biomarker and supports strategies of dietary intervention and direct lactagenesis blockade in treating advanced prostate cancer. Lactate accumulation driven by high-fat diet and MYC reprograms the tumor microenvironment and promotes prostate cancer progression, supporting the potential of lactate as a biomarker and therapeutic target in prostate cancer.

Genetics may account for differences in CAP tolerance and its impact on adiposity status. The aim of this study was to systematically review current evidence concerning the role of genetic polymorphisms influencing CAP tolerance. The present systematic review analyzed and synthesized available evidence concerning associations between genetic polymorphisms and CAP tolerance following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. Databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane, Scopus, Google Scholar, SciELO, and LILACS were screened. Out of 228 publications identified, only 6 meet inclusion criteria and were finally included in the final report. Overall, a total of 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with several CAP tolerance traits including sensitivity to burning/stinging, heat pain, and cough reactions, and detection of bitter taste thresholds. These genetic variants were located within 6 genes involved in key physiological processes such synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin and nitric oxide production (GCH1), CAP uptake and transduction of thermal stimuli (TRPV1), and bitter taste perception (TAS2R38, TAS2R3, TAS2R4, and TAS2R5).

This self-regulating system plays a pivotal role in synchronizing physiological and behavioral responses, ensuring an adaptive metabolism within the environmental milieu, including dietary and physical activity habits. The systemic integration of circadian homeostasis involves a balance of biological rhythms, each synchronically linked to the central circadian clock. Central to this orchestration is the temporal dimension of nutrient and food intake, an aspect closely interwoven with the neuroendocrine circuit, gut physiology, and resident microbiota. Indeed, the timing of meals exerts a profound influence on cell cycle regulation through genomic and epigenetic processes, particularly those involving gene expression, DNA methylation and repair, and non-coding RNA activity. These (epi)genomic interactions involve a dynamic interface between circadian rhythms, nutrition, and the gut microbiota, shaping the metabolic and immune landscape of the host. This research endeavors to illustrate the intricate (epi)genetic interplay that modulates the synchronization of circadian rhythms, nutritional signaling, and the gut microbiota, unravelling the repercussions on metabolic health while suggesting the potential benefits of feed circadian realignment as a non-invasive therapeutic strategy for systemic metabolic modulation via gut microbiota.

38781288,Nutrigenetic and Epigenetic Mechanisms of Maternal Nutrition-Induced Glucolipid Metabolism Changes in the Offspring.,"Maternal nutrition during pregnancy regulates the offspring's metabolic homeostasis, including insulin sensitivity and the metabolism of glucose and lipids. The fetus undergoes a crucial period of plasticity in the uterus; metabolic changes in the fetus during pregnancy caused by maternal nutrition not only influence fetal growth and development but also have a long-term or even life-long impact for the offspring. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNAs, play important roles in intergenerational and transgenerational effects. In this context, this narrative review comprehensively summarizes and analyzes the molecular mechanisms underlying how maternal nutrition, including a high-fat diet, polyunsaturated fatty acid diet, methyl donor nutrient supplementation, feed restriction, and protein restriction during pregnancy, impacts the genes involved in glucolipid metabolism in the liver, adipose tissue, hypothalamus, muscle, and oocytes of the offspring in terms of the epigenetic modifications. This will provide a foundation for the further exploration of nutrigenetic and epigenetic mechanisms for integrative mother-child nutrition and promotion of the offspring's health through the regulation of maternal nutrition during pregnancy.

38776919,A genomic compendium of cultivated human gut fungi characterizes the gut mycobiome and its relevance to common diseases.,"The gut fungal community represents an essential element of human health, yet its functional and metabolic potential remains insufficiently elucidated, largely due to the limited availability of reference genomes. To address this gap, we presented the cultivated gut fungi (CGF) catalog, encompassing 760 fungal genomes derived from the feces of healthy individuals. This catalog comprises 206 species spanning 48 families, including 69 species previously unidentified. We explored the functional and metabolic attributes of the CGF species and utilized this catalog to construct a phylogenetic representation of the gut mycobiome by analyzing over 11,000 fecal metagenomes from Chinese and non-Chinese populations. Moreover, we identified significant common disease-related variations in gut mycobiome composition and corroborated the associations between fungal signatures and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) through animal experimentation. These resources and findings substantially enrich our understanding of the biological diversity and disease relevance of the human gut mycobiome.",Yan Q; Li S; Yan Q; Huo X; Wang C; Wang X; Sun Y; Zhao W; Yu Z; Zhang Y; Guo R; Lv Q; He X; Yao C; Li Z; Chen F; Ji Q; Zhang A; Jin H; Wang G; Feng X; Feng L; Wu F; Ning J; Deng S; An Y; Guo DA; Martin FM; Ma X,Cell,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38776919/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38767067,A comparative study of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms applied to human microbiome.,"The human microbiome, consisting of diverse bacte-rial, fungal, protozoan and viral species, exerts a profound influence on various physiological processes and disease susceptibility. However, the complexity of microbiome data has presented significant challenges in the analysis and interpretation of these intricate datasets, leading to the development of specialized software that employs machine learning algorithms for these aims. In this paper, we analyze raw data taken from 16S rRNA gene sequencing from three studies, including stool samples from healthy control, patients with adenoma, and patients with colorectal cancer. Firstly, we use network-based methods to reduce dimensions of the dataset and consider only the most important features. In addition, we employ supervised machine learning algorithms to make prediction. Results show that graph-based techniques reduces dimen-sion from 255 up to 78 features with modularity score 0.73 based on different centrality measures. On the other hand, projection methods (non-negative matrix factorization and principal component analysis) reduce dimensions to 7 features. Furthermore, we apply supervised machine learning algorithms on the most important features obtained from centrality measures and on the ones obtained from projection methods, founding that the evaluation metrics have approximately the same scores when applying the algorithms on the entire dataset, on 78 feature and on 7 features. This study demonstrates the efficacy of graph-based and projection methods in the interpretation for 16S rRNA gene sequencing data. Supervised machine learning on refined features from both approaches yields comparable predictive performance, emphasizing specific microbial features-bacteroides, prevotella, fusobacterium, lysinibacillus, blautia, sphingomonas, and faecalibacterium-as key in predicting patient conditions from raw data.",Kalluçi E; Preni B; Dhamo X; Noka E; Bardhi S; Macchia A; Bonetti G; Dhuli K; Donato K; Bertelli M; Zambrano LJM; Janaqi S,La Clinica terapeutica,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38767067/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38757622,SELENOI Functions as a Key Modulator of Ferroptosis Pathway in Colitis and Colorectal Cancer.,"Ferroptosis plays important roles both in normal physiology and multiple human diseases. It is well known that selenoprotein named glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) is a crucial regulator for ferroptosis. However, it remains unknown whether other selenoproteins responsible for the regulation of ferroptosis, particularly in gut diseases. In this study, it is observed that Selenoprotein I (Selenoi) prevents ferroptosis by maintaining ether lipids homeostasis. Specific deletion of Selenoi in intestinal epithelial cells induced the occurrence of ferroptosis, leading to impaired intestinal regeneration and compromised colonic tumor growth. Mechanistically, Selenoi deficiency causes a remarkable decrease in ether-linked phosphatidylethanolamine (ePE) and a marked increase in ether-linked phosphatidylcholine (ePC). The imbalance of ePE and ePC results in the upregulation of phospholipase A2, group IIA (Pla2g2a) and group V (Pla2g5), as well as arachidonate-15-lipoxygenase (Alox15), which give rise to excessive lipid peroxidation. Knockdown of PLA2G2A, PLA2G5, or ALOX15 can reverse the ferroptosis phenotypes, suggesting that they are downstream effectors of SELENOI. Strikingly, GPX4 overexpression cannot rescue the ferroptosis phenotypes of SELENOI-knockdown cells, while SELENOI overexpression can partially rescue GPX4-knockdown-induced ferroptosis. It suggests that SELENOI prevents ferroptosis independent of GPX4. Taken together, these findings strongly support the notion that SELENOI functions as a novel suppressor of ferroptosis during colitis and colon tumorigenesis.",Huang X; Yang X; Zhang M; Li T; Zhu K; Dong Y; Lei X; Yu Z; Lv C; Huang J,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38757622/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38734117,"Protective effects of butyric acid during heat stress on the survival, immune response, histopathology, and gene expression in the hepatopancreas of juvenile pacific shrimp (L. Vannamei).","This study looked at the effects of adding butyric acid (BA) to the diets of juvenile Pacific shrimp and how it affected their response to survival, immunity, histopathological, and gene expression profiles under heat stress. The shrimp were divided into groups: a control group with no BA supplementation and groups with BA inclusion levels of 0.5 %, 1 %, 1.5 %, 2 %, and 2.5 %. Following the 8-week feeding trial period, the shrimp endured a heat stress test lasting 1 h at a temperature of 38 °C. The results showed that the control group had a lower survival rate than those given BA. Interestingly, no mortality was observed in the group receiving 1.5 % BA supplementation. Heat stress had a negative impact on the activities of alkaline phosphatase (AKP) and acid phosphatase (ACP) in the control group. Still, these activities were increased in shrimp fed the BA diet. Similar variations were observed in AST and ALT fluctuations among the different groups. The levels of triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol (CHO) increased with high temperatures but were reduced in shrimp-supplemented BA. The activity of an antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) increased with higher BA levels (P < 0.05). Moreover, the groups supplemented with 1.5 % BA exhibited a significant reduction in malondialdehyde (MDA) content (P < 0.05), suggesting the potential antioxidant properties of BA. The histology of the shrimp's hepatopancreas showed improvements in the groups given BA. Conversely, the BA significantly down-regulated the HSPs and up-regulated MnSOD transcript level in response to heat stress. The measured parameters determine the essential dietary requirement of BA for shrimp. Based on the results, the optimal level of BA for survival, antioxidant function, and immunity for shrimp under heat stress is 1.5 %.",Yohana MA; Ray GW; Yang Q; Kou S; Tan B; Wu J; Mao M; Bo Ge Z; Feng L,Fish & shellfish immunology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38734117/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38728013,Conjugated linoleic acid metabolite impact in colorectal cancer: a potential microbiome-based precision nutrition approach.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most deadly and the third most diagnosed cancer in both sexes worldwide. CRC pathogenesis is associated with risk factors such as genetics, alcohol, smoking, sedentariness, obesity, unbalanced diets, and gut microbiota dysbiosis. The gut microbiota is the microbial community living in symbiosis in the intestine, in a dynamic balance vital for health. Increasing evidence underscores the influence of specific gut microbiota bacterial species on CRC incidence and pathogenesis. In this regard, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) metabolites produced by certain gut microbiota have demonstrated an anticarcinogenic effect in CRC, influencing pathways for inflammation, proliferation, and apoptosis. CLA production occurs naturally in the rumen, and human bioavailability is through the consumption of food derived from ruminants. In recent years, biotechnological attempts to increase CLA bioavailability in humans have been unfruitful. Therefore, the conversion of essential dietary linoleic acid to CLA metabolite by specific intestinal bacteria has become a promising process. This article reviews the evidence regarding CLA and CLA-producing bacteria as therapeutic agents against CRC and investigates the best strategy for increasing the yield and bioavailability of CLA. Given the potential and limitations of the present strategies, a new microbiome-based precision nutrition approach based on endogenous CLA production by human gut bacteria is proposed. A literature search in the PubMed and PubMed Central databases identified 794 papers on human gut bacteria associated with CLA production. Of these, 51 studies exploring association consistency were selected. After excluding 19 papers, due to health concerns or discrepancies between studies, 32 papers were selected for analysis, encompassing data for 38 CLA-producing bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species. The information was analyzed by a bioinformatics food recommendation system patented by our research group, Phymofood (EP22382095). This paper presents a new microbiome-based precision nutrition approach targeting CLA-producing gut bacterial species to maximize the anticarcinogenic effect of CLA in CRC.",González A; Fullaondo A; Rodríguez J; Tirnauca C; Odriozola I; Odriozola A,Nutrition reviews,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38728013/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38727988,Heterologous expression of P9 from Akkermansia muciniphila increases the GLP-1 secretion of intestinal L cells.,"Glucagon-like peptide-1(GLP-1) is an incretin hormone secreted primarily from the intestinal L-cells in response to meals. GLP-1 is a key regulator of energy metabolism and food intake. It has been proven that P9 protein from A. muciniphila could increase GLP-1 release and improve glucose homeostasis in HFD-induced mice. To obtain an engineered Lactococcus lactis which produced P9 protein, mature polypeptide chain of P9 was codon-optimized, fused with N-terminal signal peptide Usp45, and expressed in L. lactis NZ9000. Heterologous secretion of P9 by recombinant L. lactis NZP9 were successfully detected by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. Notably, the supernatant of L. lactis NZP9 stimulated GLP-1 production of NCI-H716 cells. The relative expression level of GLP-1 biosynthesis gene GCG and PCSK1 were upregulated by 1.63 and 1.53 folds, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the secretory expression of carboxyl-terminal processing protease P9 from A. muciniphila in L. lactis. Our results suggest that genetically engineered L. lactis which expressed P9 may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of diabetes, obesity and other metabolic disorders.",Di W; Zhang Y; Zhang X; Han L; Zhao L; Hao Y; Zhai Z,World journal of microbiology & biotechnology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38727988/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38725850,The Effect Mechanism of N6-adenosine Methylation (m6A) in Melatonin Regulated LPS-induced Colon Inflammation.,"Colon inflammation is characterized by disturbances in the intestinal microbiota and inflammation. Melatonin (Mel) can improve colon inflammation. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Recent studies suggest that m6A methylation modification may play an important role in inflammatory responses. This study aimed to explore the effects of melatonin and LPS-mediated m6A methylation on colon inflammation. Our study found that melatonin inhibits M1 macrophages, activates M2 macrophages, inhibit the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors, maintain colon homeostasis and improves colon inflammation through MTNR1B. In addition, the increased methylation level of m6A is associated with the occurrence of colon inflammation, and melatonin can also reduce the level of colon methylation to improve colon inflammation. Among them, the main methylated protein METTL3 can be inhibited by melatonin through MTNR1B. In a word, melatonin regulates m6A methylation by improving abnormal METTL3 protein level to reshape the microflora and activate macrophages to improve colon inflammation, mainly through MTNR1B.",Li Y; Ma B; Wang Z; Chen Y; Dong Y,International journal of biological sciences,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38725850/,0,0,0,0,0,0

38722240,"Digital applications for diet monitoring, planning, and precision nutrition for citizens and professionals: a state of the art.","The objective of this review was to critically examine existing digital applications, tailored for use by citizens and professionals, to provide diet monitoring, diet planning, and precision nutrition. We sought to identify the strengths and weaknesses of such digital applications, while exploring their potential contributions to enhancing public health, and discussed potential developmental pathways. Nutrition is a critical aspect of maintaining good health, with an unhealthy diet being one of the primary risk factors for chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Tracking and monitoring one's diet has been shown to help improve health and weight management. However, this task can be complex and time-consuming, often leading to frustration and a lack of adherence to dietary recommendations. Digital applications for diet monitoring, diet generation, and precision nutrition offer the promise of better health outcomes. Data on current nutrition-based digital tools was collected from pertinent literature and software providers. These digital tools have been designed for particular user groups: citizens, nutritionists, and physicians and researchers employing genetics and epigenetics tools. The applications were evaluated in terms of their key functionalities, strengths, and limitations. The analysis primarily concentrated on artificial intelligence algorithms and devices intended to streamline the collection and organization of nutrition data. Furthermore, an exploration was conducted of potential future advancements in this field. Digital applications designed for the use of citizens allow diet self-monitoring, and they can be an effective tool for weight and diabetes management, while digital precision nutrition solutions for professionals can provide scalability, personalized recommendations for patients, and a means of providing ongoing diet support. The limitations in using these digital applications include data accuracy, accessibility, and affordability, and further research and development are required. The integration of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and blockchain technology holds promise for improving the performance, security, and privacy of digital precision nutrition interventions. Multidisciplinarity is crucial for evidence-based and accessible solutions. Digital applications for diet monitoring and precision nutrition have the potential to revolutionize nutrition and health. These tools can make it easier for individuals to control their diets, help nutritionists provide better care, and enable physicians to offer personalized treatment.",Abeltino A; Riente A; Bianchetti G; Serantoni C; De Spirito M; Capezzone S; Esposito R; Maulucci G,Nutrition reviews,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38722240/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38692553,Biomolecular investigations into BBI reveal an enzymatic mechanism for PUFA isomerisation in bifidobacterium CFA bioconversion strains.,"Multiple species of Bifidobacterium exhibit the ability to bioconvert conjugated fatty acids (CFAs), which is considered an important pathway for these strains to promote host health. However, there has been limited progress in understanding the enzymatic mechanism of CFA bioconversion by bifidobacteria, despite the increasing number of studies identifying CFA-producing strains. The protein responsible for polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) isomerization in B. breve CCFM683 has recently been discovered and named BBI, providing a starting point for exploring Bifidobacterium isomerases (BIs). This study presents the sequence classification of membrane-bound isomerases from four common Bifidobacterium species that produce CFA. Heterologous expression, purification, and enzymatic studies of the typical sequences revealed that all possess a single c9, t11 isomer as the product and share common features in terms of enzymatic properties and catalytic kinetics. Using molecular docking and alanine scanning, Lys84, Tyr198, Asn202, and Leu245 located in the binding pocket were identified as critical to the catalytic activity, a finding further confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis-based screening assays. Overall, these findings provide insightful knowledge concerning the molecular mechanisms of BIs.

38586455,Meal timing and its role in obesity and associated diseases.,"Meal timing emerges as a crucial factor influencing metabolic health that can be explained by the tight interaction between the endogenous circadian clock and metabolic homeostasis. Mistimed food intake, such as delayed or nighttime consumption, leads to desynchronization of the internal circadian clock and is associated with an increased risk for obesity and associated metabolic disturbances such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Conversely, meal timing aligned with cellular rhythms can optimize the performance of tissues and organs. In this review, we provide an overview of the metabolic effects of meal timing and discuss the underlying mechanisms. Additionally, we explore factors influencing meal timing, including internal determinants such as chronotype and genetics, as well as external influences like social factors, cultural aspects, and work schedules. This review could contribute to defining meal-timing-based recommendations for public health initiatives and developing guidelines for effective lifestyle modifications targeting the prevention and treatment of obesity and associated metabolic diseases. Furthermore, it sheds light on crucial factors that must be considered in the design of future food timing intervention trials.",Peters B; Vahlhaus J; Pivovarova-Ramich O,Frontiers in endocrinology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38586455/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38564658,Homologous Overexpression of Tyrosinase in <i>Trichoderma reesei</i> and Its Application in Glycinin Cross-Linking.,"Tyrosinase is capable of oxidizing tyrosine residues in proteins, leading to intermolecular protein cross-linking, which could modify the protein network of food and improve the texture of food. To obtain the recombinant tyrosinase with microbial cell factory instead of isolation tyrosinase from the mushroom <i>Agaricus bisporus</i>, a TYR expression cassette was constructed in this study. The expression cassette was electroporated into <i>Trichoderma reesei</i> Rut-C30 and integrated into its genome, resulting in a recombinant strain C30-TYR. After induction with microcrystalline cellulose for 7 days, recombinant tyrosinase could be successfully expressed and secreted by C30-TYR, corresponding to approximately 2.16 g/L tyrosinase in shake-flask cultures. The recombinant TYR was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel filtration, and the biological activity of purified TYR was 45.6 U/mL. The purified TYR could catalyze the cross-linking of glycinin, and the emulsion stability index of TYR-treated glycinin emulsion was increased by 30.6% compared with the untreated one. The cross-linking of soy glycinin by TYR resulted in altered properties of oil-in-water emulsions compared to emulsions stabilized by native glycinin. Therefore, cross-linking with this recombinant tyrosinase is a feasible approach to improve the properties of protein-stabilized emulsions and gels.",Yan J; Yu Y; Wang Y; Hou K; Lv C; Chen H; Zhao L; Hao Y; Zhai Z,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38564658/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Recently, precision nutrition (PN) has emerged as a tailored approach to provide individualised dietary recommendations. This review discusses the major intrinsic and extrinsic components considered when applying PN during the management of obesity and common associated chronic conditions. The review identified three main PN components: gene-nutrient interactions, intestinal microbiota, and lifestyle factors. Genetic makeup significantly contributes to inter-individual variations in dietary behaviours, with advanced genome sequencing and population genetics aiding in detecting gene variants associated with obesity. Additionally, PN-based host-microbiota evaluation emerges as an advanced therapeutic tool, impacting disease control and prevention. The gut microbiome's composition regulates diverse responses to nutritional recommendations. Several studies highlight PN's effectiveness in improving diet quality and enhancing adherence to physical activity among obese patients. PN is a key strategy for addressing obesity-related risk factors, encompassing dietary patterns, body weight, fat, blood lipids, glucose levels, and insulin resistance. PN stands out as a feasible tool for effectively managing obesity, considering its ability to integrate genetic and lifestyle factors. The application of PN-based approaches not only improves current obesity conditions but also holds promise for preventing obesity and its associated complications in the long term.",Mansour S; Alkhaaldi SMI; Sammanasunathan AF; Ibrahim S; Farhat J; Al-Omari B,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38474710/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38442341,Understanding and applying gene-environment interactions: a guide for nutrition professionals with an emphasis on integration in African research settings.,"Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are influenced by the interplay between genetics and environmental exposures, particularly diet. However, many healthcare professionals, including nutritionists and dietitians, have limited genetic background and, therefore, they may lack understanding of gene-environment interactions (GxEs) studies. Even researchers deeply involved in nutrition studies, but with a focus elsewhere, can struggle to interpret, evaluate, and conduct GxE studies. There is an urgent need to study African populations that bear a heavy burden of NCDs, demonstrate unique genetic variability, and have cultural practices resulting in distinctive environmental exposures compared with Europeans or Americans, who are studied more. Although diverse and rapidly changing environments, as well as the high genetic variability of Africans and difference in linkage disequilibrium (ie, certain gene variants are inherited together more often than expected by chance), provide unparalleled potential to investigate the omics fields, only a small percentage of studies come from Africa. Furthermore, research evidence lags behind the practices of companies offering genetic testing for personalized medicine and nutrition. We need to generate more evidence on GxEs that also considers continental African populations to be able to prevent unethical practices and enable tailored treatments. This review aims to introduce nutrition professionals to genetics terms and valid methods to investigate GxEs and their challenges, and proposes ways to improve quality and reproducibility. The review also provides insight into the potential contributions of nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics to the healthcare sphere, addresses direct-to-consumer genetic testing, and concludes by offering insights into the field's future, including advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning.",Nienaber-Rousseau C,Nutrition reviews,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38442341/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The entire testing process, from sample collection to results, takes only 0.5 h. These characteristics fulfill the demands of researchers seeking rapid target detection with minimal equipment reliance. For genomic extraction, this study evaluated the ability of two filter papers to capture genomes. A rapid genomic extraction device combined with the two filter papers was designed to simplify the genomic extraction process, which was completed within 10 min and increased the detection sensitivity tenfold. The method utilized a simplified primer design for isothermal amplification, namely allosteric strand displacement (ASD), and employed an underutilized commercial color indicator, Bromothymol Blue (BTB), for signal output. Compared with other reported indicators, BTB exhibited a more pronounced color change, shifting from blue to yellow in positive samples, facilitating easier visual differentiation. The reaction was completed in 20 min with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 0.014 T. gondii per microliter.",Wang L; Zhang Z; Liu Y; Lin S; Zhang W; Zhu L; Xu W; Dong Y,Biosensors & bioelectronics,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38382270/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38374797,<i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i> subsp. <i>lactis</i> A6 attenuates hippocampal damage and memory impairments in an ADHD rat model.,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is commonly accompanied by learning and memory deficits. This study aimed to demonstrate the effects of probiotic <i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i> subsp. <i>lactis</i> A6 (BAA6) on behaviour and memory function in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). The results showed that BAA6 treatment ameliorated spatial working memory deficits and inhibited hippocampal neuron loss in SHRs. The levels of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, dopamine, and norepinephrine, and the brain derived neurotrophic factor increased and that of glutamate decreased in the brain tissue of SHRs after BAA6 administration. Moreover, BAA6 reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β, and increased the levels of anti-inflammatory IL-10 and antioxidant glutathione in SHRs. 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing showed that BAA6 treatment changed the gut microbiota composition. BAA6 promoted beneficial <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Romboutsia</i>, <i>Blautia</i>, and <i>Turicibacter</i>, and decreased the enrichment of bacterial genera such as <i>Dietzia</i>, <i>Sporosarcina</i>, <i>Brevibacterium</i>, <i>NK4A214</i>_group, <i>Atopostipes</i>, and <i>Facklamia</i> negatively associated with neurotransmitter release and anti-inflammatory effects in SHRs. Together, these results suggested that BAA6 improved memory function by ameliorating hippocampal damage, abnormal neurotransmitter release and cerebral inflammation by reshaping the gut microbiota in SHRs. This study provides a scientific basis for the development and application of BAA6 as a promising dietary intervention to reduce the risk of ADHD.",Yin X; Liu W; Feng H; Huang J; Wang Q; Zhang Q; He J; Wang R,Food & function,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38374797/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38366942,Intracellular Regulation Limits the Response of Intestinal Ferroportin to Iron Status in Suckling Rats.,"Iron status is regulated via iron absorption as there is no active iron excretion. Divalent metal-ion transporter-1 (DMT1) and ferroportin (FPN) are two key proteins vital for iron absorption, but the regulation of them in suckling mammals differs from that in adults. This study aims to explore regulation of iron transporters under different iron conditions during suckling. This study developed suckling rats under different iron conditions. Unexpectedly, unchanged FPN at different iron status are detected. Since FPN is the only known iron exporter for mammals, unchanged FPN limits iron exported into blood during suckling. Thus, factors regulating FPN at transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational levels are detected. Results showed that Fpn mRNA is upregulated, while micro RNA-485(miR-485) which could silence Fpn mRNA is upregulated at low iron status limiting translation of Fpn mRNA. Besides, serum hepcidin and liver Hamp mRNA are upregulated, but ring finger protein 217( Rnf217) mRNA remained unchanged at high iron status leading to FPN not downregulated as adults. Overall, this study indicates that translational regulation limits intestinal FPN protein response to iron deficiency and Rnf217 cannot effectively mediate the degradation of FPN at high iron status, which provides a reference for maintaining iron homeostasis during suckling.",Qiu L; Hu M; Qin X; Song R; Sun Y; Wang X,Molecular nutrition & food research,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38366942/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38323712,Differential effects of four laboratory animal control diets on gut microbiota in mice.,"The gut microbiota is intricate and susceptible to multiple factors, with diet being a major contributor. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of four commonly used laboratory animal control diets, namely Keao Xieli's maintenance diet (KX), HFK's 1025 (HF), Research Diets' D12450B (RD), and Lab Diet's 5CC4 (LD), on the gut microbiota of mice. A total of 40 mice were randomly assigned to four groups, and each group was fed one of the four diets for a duration of 8 weeks. The assessment of gut microbiota was conducted using 16S rRNA sequencing both at the beginning of the study (week 0) and the end (week 8), which served as the baseline and endpoint samples, respectively. Following the 8-week feeding period, no significant differences were observed in physiological parameters, including body weight, visceral weight, and blood biochemical indices, across the four groups. Nonetheless, relative to the baseline, discernible alterations in the gut microbiota were observed in all groups, encompassing shifts in beta-diversity, hierarchical clustering, and key genera. Among the four diets, HF diet exhibited a significant influence on alpha-diversity, RD diet brought about notable changes in microbial composition at the phylum level, and LD diet demonstrated an interconnected co-occurrence network. Mantel analysis indicated no significant correlation between physiological parameters and gut microbiota in the four groups. Overall, our study demonstrated that the four control diets had a minimal impact on physiological parameters, while exerting a distinct influence on the gut microbiota after 8 weeks. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",Guo J; Zhao Y; Kang SG; Huang K; Tong T,Journal of the science of food and agriculture,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38323712/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38319599,Effects of the ApoE genotype on cognitive function in aging mice fed with a high-fat diet and the protective potential of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.,"The <i>ApoE4</i> allele is the strongest genetic determinant for Alzheimer's disease (AD), while obesity is a strong environmental risk for AD. The modulatory effect of the ApoE genotype on aging-related cognitive function in tandem with a high-fat diet (HFD) remains uncertain. This study aimed to elucidate the effects of ApoE3/ApoE4 genotypes in aged mice exposed to a HFD, and the benefits of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) from fish oil. Remarkably, the HFD led to weight gain and lipid accumulation, more pronounced in ApoE3 mice, while ApoE4 mice experienced exacerbated cerebral insulin resistance, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. Critically, n-3 PUFAs modulated the cerebral insulin signaling via the IRS-1/AKT/GLUT4 pathway, mitigated microglial hyperactivity, and reduced IL-6 and MDA levels, thereby counteracting cognitive deficits. These findings highlight the contrasting impacts of ApoE genotypes on aging mice exposed to a HFD, supporting n-3 PUFAs as a strategic nutritional intervention for brain health, especially for ApoE4 carriers.",Zhang X; Xie T; Zhou S; Yuan Y; Chen W; Zheng J; Liu X; Yuan T; Lu Y; Liu Z,Food & function,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38319599/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38316796,Short-term periodic restricted feeding elicits metabolome-microbiome signatures with sex dimorphic persistence in primate intervention.,"Dietary restriction has shown benefits in physiological, metabolic, and molecular signatures associated with aging but is a difficult lifestyle to maintain for most individuals. In mice, a less restrictive diet that allows for cyclical periods of reduced calories mitigates aging phenotypes, yet the effects of such an intervention in a genetically heterogenous, higher-order mammal has not been examined. Here, using middle-aged rhesus macaques matched for age and sex, we show that a regimen of 4 days of low-calorie intake followed by 10 days of ad libitum feeding (4:10 diet) performed in repeating cycles over 12 weeks led to significant loss of weight and fat percentage, despite the free access to food for most of the study duration. We show the 4-day restriction period is sufficient to drive alterations to the serum metabolome characterized by substantial differences in lipid classes. These phenotypes were paralleled by changes in the gut microbiome of restricted monkeys that highlight the involvement of a microbiome-metabolome axis. This regimen shows promising phenotypes, with some sex-dimorphic responses, including residual memory of the diet. As many calorie restriction interventions are difficult to sustain, we propose that this short-term diet may be easier to adhere to and have benefits directly relevant to human aging.",Yanai H; Park B; Koh H; Jang HJ; Vaughan KL; Tanaka-Yano M; Aon M; Blanton M; Messaoudi I; Diaz-Ruiz A; Mattison JA; Beerman I,Nature communications,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38316796/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38281958,A genomics perspective of personalized prevention and management of obesity.,"This review discusses the landscape of personalized prevention and management of obesity from a nutrigenetics perspective. Focusing on macronutrient tailoring, we discuss the impact of genetic variation on responses to carbohydrate, lipid, protein, and fiber consumption. Our bioinformatic analysis of genomic variants guiding macronutrient intake revealed enrichment of pathways associated with circadian rhythm, melatonin metabolism, cholesterol and lipoprotein remodeling and PPAR signaling as potential targets of macronutrients for the management of obesity in relevant genetic backgrounds. Notably, our data-based in silico predictions suggest the potential of repurposing the SYK inhibitor fostamatinib for obesity treatment in relevant genetic profiles. In addition to dietary considerations, we address genetic variations guiding lifestyle changes in weight management, including exercise and chrononutrition. Finally, we emphasize the need for a refined understanding and expanded research into the complex genetic landscape underlying obesity and its management.",Gkouskou KK; Grammatikopoulou MG; Lazou E; Vasilogiannakopoulou T; Sanoudou D; Eliopoulos AG,Human genomics,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38281958/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38276558,Cow's Milk: A Benefit for Human Health? Omics Tools and Precision Nutrition for Lactose Intolerance Management.,"Cow's milk (CM) is a healthy food consumed worldwide by individuals of all ages. Unfortunately, ""lactase-deficient"" individuals cannot digest milk's main carbohydrate, lactose, depriving themselves of highly beneficial milk proteins like casein, lactoalbumin, and lactoglobulin due to lactose intolerance (LI), while other individuals develop allergies specifically against these proteins (CMPA). The management of these conditions differs, and an inappropriate diagnosis or treatment may have significant implications for the patients, especially if they are infants or very young children, resulting in unnecessary dietary restrictions or avoidable adverse reactions. Omics technologies play a pivotal role in elucidating the intricate interactions between nutrients and the human body, spanning from genetic factors to the microbiota profile and metabolites. This comprehensive approach enables the precise delineation and identification of distinct cohorts of individuals with specific dietary requirements, so that tailored nutrition strategies can be developed. This is what is called personalized nutrition or precision nutrition (PN), the area of nutrition that focuses on the effects of nutrients on the genome, proteome, and metabolome, promoting well-being and health, preventing diseases, reducing chronic disease incidence, and increasing life expectancy. Here, we report the opinion of the scientific community proposing to replace the ""one size fits all"" approach with tailor-made nutrition programs, designed by integrating nutrigenomic data together with clinical parameters and microbiota profiles, taking into account the individual lactose tolerance threshold and needs in terms of specific nutrients intake. This customized approach could help LI patients to improve their quality of life, overcoming depression or anxiety often resulting from the individual perception of this condition as different from a normal state.",Pratelli G; Tamburini B; Badami GD; Lo Pizzo M; De Blasio A; Carlisi D; Di Liberto D,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38276558/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38271475,Splicing factor SRSF1 is essential for homing of precursor spermatogonial stem cells in mice.,"Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are essential for continuous spermatogenesis and male fertility. The underlying mechanisms of alternative splicing (AS) in mouse SSCs are still largely unclear. We demonstrated that SRSF1 is essential for gene expression and splicing in mouse SSCs. Crosslinking immunoprecipitation and sequencing data revealed that spermatogonia-related genes (e.g. <i>Plzf</i>, <i>Id4</i>, <i>Setdb1, Stra8</i>, <i>Tial1</i>/<i>Tiar</i>, <i>Bcas2</i>, <i>Ddx5</i>, <i>Srsf10</i>, <i>Uhrf1</i>, and <i>Bud31</i>) were bound by SRSF1 in the mouse testes. Specific deletion of <i>Srsf1</i> in mouse germ cells impairs homing of precursor SSCs leading to male infertility. Whole-mount staining data showed the absence of germ cells in the testes of adult conditional knockout (cKO) mice, which indicates Sertoli cell-only syndrome in cKO mice. The expression of spermatogonia-related genes (e.g. <i>Gfra1</i>, <i>Pou5f1</i>, <i>Plzf</i>, <i>Dnd1</i>, <i>Stra8</i>, and <i>Taf4b</i>) was significantly reduced in the testes of cKO mice. Moreover, multiomics analysis suggests that SRSF1 may affect survival of spermatogonia by directly binding and regulating <i>Tial1</i>/<i>Tiar</i> expression through AS. In addition, immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation data showed that SRSF1 interacts with RNA splicing-related proteins (e.g. SART1, RBM15, and SRSF10). Collectively, our data reveal the critical role of SRSF1 in spermatogonia survival, which may provide a framework to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the posttranscriptional network underlying homing of precursor SSCs.",Sun L; Lv Z; Chen X; Ye R; Tian S; Wang C; Xie X; Yan L; Yao X; Shao Y; Cui S; Chen J; Liu J,eLife,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38271475/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38258600,Apolipoprotein E-ε2 and Resistance to Atherosclerosis in Midlife: The PESA Observational Study.,"APOE is a known genetic contributor to cardiovascular disease, but the differential role <i>APOE</i> alleles play in subclinical atherosclerosis remains unclear. The PESA (Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis) is an observational cohort study that recruited 4184 middle-aged asymptomatic individuals to be screened for cardiovascular risk and multiterritorial subclinical atherosclerosis. Participants were <i>APOE</i>-genotyped, and omics data were additionally evaluated. In the PESA study, the frequencies for <i>APOE</i> -ε2, -ε3, and -ε4 alleles were 0.060, 0.844, and 0.096, respectively. This study included a subcohort of 3887 participants (45.8±4.3 years of age; 62% males). As expected, <i>APOE</i>-ε4 carriers were at the highest risk for cardiovascular disease and had significantly greater odds of having subclinical atherosclerosis compared with ε3/ε3 carriers, which was mainly explained by their higher levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. In turn, <i>APOE</i>-ε2 carriers were at the lowest risk for cardiovascular disease and had significantly lower odds of having subclinical atherosclerosis in several vascular territories (carotids: 0.62 [95% CI, 0.47-0.81]; <i>P</i>=0.00043; femorals: 0.60 [0.47-0.78]; <i>P</i>=9.96×10<sup>-5</sup>; coronaries: 0.53 [0.39-0.74]; <i>P</i>=0.00013; and increased PESA score: 0.58 [0.48-0.71]; <i>P</i>=3.16×10<sup>-8</sup>). This <i>APOE</i>-ε2 atheroprotective effect was mostly independent of the associated lower LDL-cholesterol levels and other cardiovascular risk factors. The protection conferred by the ε2 allele was greater with age (50-54 years: 0.49 [95% CI, 0.32-0.73]; <i>P</i>=0.00045), and normal (<150 mg/dL) levels of triglycerides (0.54 [0.44-0.66]; <i>P</i>=4.70×10<sup>-9</sup> versus 0.90 [0.57-1.43]; <i>P</i>=0.67 if ≥150 mg/dL). Omics analysis revealed an enrichment of several canonical pathways associated with anti-inflammatory mechanisms together with the modulation of erythrocyte homeostasis, coagulation, and complement activation in ε2 carriers that might play a relevant role in the ε2's atheroprotective effect. This work sheds light on the role of APOE in cardiovascular disease development with important therapeutic and prevention implications on cardiovascular health, especially in early midlife.

38255808,Melatonin Alleviates Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Abnormal Pregnancy through MTNR1B Regulation of m6A.,"Pregnancy is a highly intricate and delicate process, where inflammation during early stages may lead to pregnancy loss or defective implantation. Melatonin, primarily produced by the pineal gland, exerts several pharmacological effects. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent mRNA modification in eukaryotes. This study aimed to investigate the association between melatonin and m6A during pregnancy and elucidate the underlying protective mechanism of melatonin. Melatonin was found to alleviate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced reductions in the number of implantation sites. Additionally, it mitigated the activation of inflammation, autophagy, and apoptosis pathways, thereby protecting the pregnancy process in mice. The study also revealed that melatonin regulates uterine m6A methylation levels and counteracts abnormal changes in m6A modification of various genes following LPS stimulation. Furthermore, melatonin was shown to regulate m6A methylation through melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B) and subsequently modulate inflammation, autophagy, and apoptosis through m6A. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that melatonin protects pregnancy by influencing inflammation, autophagy, and apoptosis pathways in an m6A-dependent manner via MTNR1B. These findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying melatonin's protective effects during pregnancy and may have implications for potential therapeutic strategies in managing pregnancy-related complications.",Zhao S; Dong Y; Li Y; Wang Z; Chen Y; Dong Y,International journal of molecular sciences,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38255808/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38219722,Application of Gut Bacterial Profiling Information in Precision Nutrition for Obesity and Weight Loss Management.,"It has been suggested that the dysfunction of the gut microbiome can have deleterious effects on the regulation of body weight and adiposity by affecting energy metabolism. In this context, gut bacterial profiling studies have contributed to characterize specific bacteria associated with obesity. This review covers the information driven by gut bacterial profiling analyses and emphasizes the potential application of this knowledge in precision nutrition strategies for obesity understanding and weight loss management. Gut bacterial profiling studies have identified bacterial families that are more abundant in obese than in nonobese individuals (i.e., Prevotellaeae, Ruminococcaceae, and Veillonellaceae) as well as other families that have been repeatedly found more abundant in nonobese people (i.e., Christensenellaceae and Coriobacteriaceae), suggesting that an increase in their relative amount could be an interesting target in weight-loss treatments. Also, some gut-derived metabolites have been related to the regulation of body weight, including short-chain fatty acids, trimethylamine-N-oxide, and branched-chain and aromatic amino acids. Moreover, gut microbiota profiles may play a role in determining weight loss responses to specific nutritional treatments for the precise management of obesity. Thus, incorporating gut microbiota features may improve the performance of integrative models to predict weight loss outcomes. The application of gut bacterial profiling information is of great value for precision nutrition in metabolic diseases since it contributes to the understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in obesity onset and progression, facilitates the identification of potential microorganism targets, and allows the personalization of tailored weight loss diets as well as the prediction of adiposity outcomes based on the gut bacterial profiling of each individual. Integrating microbiota information with other omics knowledge (genetics, epigenetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular and physiological events underlying obesity and adiposity outcomes for precision nutrition.",Ramos-Lopez O; Aranaz P; Riezu-Boj JI; Milagro FI,Lifestyle genomics,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38219722/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38165790,Immunoregulation of bovine lactoferrin together with osteopontin promotes immune system development and maturation.,"The immune system of infants is partly weak and immature, and supplementation of infant formula can be of vital importance to boost the development of the immune system. Lactoferrin (LF) and osteopontin (OPN) are essential proteins in human milk with immunoregulation function. An increasing number of studies indicate that proteins have interactions with each other in milk, and our previous study found that a ratio of LF : OPN at 1 : 5 (w/w, denoted as LOP) had a synergistic effect on intestinal barrier protection. It remains unknown whether LOP can also exert a stronger effect on immunoregulation. Hence, we used an <i>in vitro</i> model of LPS-induced macrophage inflammation and <i>in vivo</i> models of LPS-induced intestinal inflammation and early life development. We showed that LOP increased the secretion of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (132%), stem cell factor (167%) and interleukin-3 (176%) in bone marrow cells, as well as thymosin (155%) and interleukin-10 (161%) in the thymus, more than LF or OPN alone during development, and inhibited changes in immune cells and cytokines during the LPS challenge. In addition, analysis of the components of digested proteins <i>in vitro</i> revealed that differentially expressed peptides may provide immunoregulation. Lastly, LOP increased the abundance of <i>Rikenellaceae</i>, <i>Muribaculum</i>, <i>Faecalibaculum</i>, and <i>Elisenbergiella</i> in the cecum content. These results imply that LOP is a potential immunomodifier for infants and offers a new theoretical basis for infant formula innovation.",Li C; Lu Y; Wang J; Liu B; Szeto IM; Zhang W; Bi R; Duan S; Quan R; Wang X; Li Y; Xiong W; Sun J; Sun Y,Food & function,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38165790/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38157451,Excessive nucleic acid R-loops induce mitochondria-dependent epithelial cell necroptosis and drive spontaneous intestinal inflammation.,"Oxidative stress, which can be activated by a variety of environmental risk factors, has been implicated as an important pathogenic factor for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, how oxidative stress drives IBD onset remains elusive. Here, we found that oxidative stress was strongly activated in inflamed tissues from both ulcerative colitis patients and Crohn's disease patients, and it caused nuclear-to-cytosolic TDP-43 transport and a reduction in the TDP-43 protein level. To investigate the function of TDP-43 in IBD, we inducibly deleted exons 2 to 3 of Tardbp (encoding Tdp-43) in mouse intestinal epithelium, which disrupted its nuclear localization and RNA-processing function. The deletion gave rise to spontaneous intestinal inflammation by inducing epithelial cell necroptosis. Suppression of the necroptotic pathway with deletion of Mlkl or the RIP1 inhibitor Nec-1 rescued colitis phenotypes. Mechanistically, disruption of nuclear TDP-43 caused excessive R-loop accumulation, which triggered DNA damage and genome instability and thereby induced PARP1 hyperactivation, leading to subsequent NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion and ATP loss, consequently activating mitochondrion-dependent necroptosis in intestinal epithelial cells. Importantly, restoration of cellular NAD<sup>+</sup> levels with NAD<sup>+</sup> or NMN supplementation, as well as suppression of ALKBH7, an α-ketoglutarate dioxygenase in mitochondria, rescued TDP-43 deficiency-induced cell death and intestinal inflammation. Furthermore, TDP-43 protein levels were significantly inversely correlated with γ-H2A.X and p-MLKL levels in clinical IBD samples, suggesting the clinical relevance of TDP-43 deficiency-induced mitochondrion-dependent necroptosis. Taken together, these findings identify a unique pathogenic mechanism that links oxidative stress to intestinal inflammation and provide a potent and valid strategy for IBD intervention.",Yang X; Li G; Lou P; Zhang M; Yao K; Xiao J; Chen Y; Xu J; Tian S; Deng M; Pan Y; Li M; Wu X; Liu R; Shi X; Tian Y; Yu L; Ke H; Jiao B; Cong Y; Plikus MV; Liu X; Yu Z; Lv C,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38157451/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38143595,Beyond Diet and Exercise: The Impact of Gut Microbiota on Control of Obesity.,"Obesity, a widespread health concern characterized by the excessive accumulation of body fat, is a complex condition influenced by genetics, environment, and social determinants. Recent research has increasingly focused on the role of gut microbiota in obesity, highlighting its pivotal involvement in various metabolic processes. The gut microbiota, a diverse community of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, interacts with the host in a myriad of ways, impacting energy metabolism, appetite regulation, inflammation, and the gut-brain axis. Dietary choices significantly shape the gut microbiota, with diets high in fat and carbohydrates promoting the growth of harmful bacteria while reducing beneficial microbes. Lifestyle factors, like physical activity and smoking, also influence gut microbiota composition. Antibiotics and medications can disrupt microbial diversity, potentially contributing to obesity. Early-life experiences, including maternal obesity during pregnancy, play a vital role in the developmental origins of obesity. Therapeutic interventions targeting the gut microbiota, including prebiotics, probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, bacterial consortium therapy, and precision nutrition, offer promising avenues for reshaping the gut microbiota and positively influencing weight regulation and metabolic health. Clinical applications of microbiota-based therapies are on the horizon, with potential implications for personalized treatments and condition-based interventions. Emerging technologies, such as next-generation sequencing and advanced bioinformatics, empower researchers to identify specific target species for microbiota-based therapeutics, opening new possibilities in healthcare. Despite the promising outlook, microbiota-based therapies face challenges related to microbial selection, safety, and regulatory issues. However, with ongoing research and advances in the field, these challenges can be addressed to unlock the full potential of microbiota-based interventions.",Kamal FD; Dagar M; Reza T; Karim Mandokhail A; Bakht D; Shahzad MW; Silloca-Cabana EO; Mohsin SN; Chilla SP; Bokhari SFH,Cureus,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38143595/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38140282,A Predictive Tool Based on DNA Methylation Data for Personalized Weight Loss through Different Dietary Strategies: A Pilot Study.,"Obesity is a public health problem. The usual treatment is a reduction in calorie intake and an increase in energy expenditure, but not all individuals respond equally to these treatments. Epigenetics could be a factor that contributes to this heterogeneity. The aim of this research was to determine the association between DNA methylation at baseline and the percentage of BMI loss (%BMIL) after two dietary interventions, in order to design a prediction model to evaluate %BMIL based on methylation data. Spanish participants with overweight or obesity (<i>n</i> = 306) were randomly assigned to two lifestyle interventions with hypocaloric diets: one moderately high in protein (MHP) and the other low in fat (LF) for 4 months (Obekit study; ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02737267). Basal DNA methylation was analyzed in white blood cells using the Infinium MethylationEPIC array. After identifying those methylation sites associated with %BMIL (<i>p</i> < 0.05 and SD > 0.1), two weighted methylation sub-scores were constructed for each diet: 15 CpGs were used for the MHP diet and 11 CpGs for the LF diet. Afterwards, a total methylation score was made by subtracting the previous sub-scores. These data were used to design a prediction model for %BMIL through a linear mixed effect model with the interaction between diet and total score. Overall, DNA methylation predicts the %BMIL of two 4-month hypocaloric diets and was able to determine which type of diet is the most appropriate for each individual. The results of this pioneer study confirm that epigenetic biomarkers may be further used for precision nutrition and the design of personalized dietary strategies against obesity.",García-Álvarez NC; Riezu-Boj JI; Martínez JA; García-Calzón S; Milagro FI,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38140282/,0,0,0,0,1,0
38126920,The tumor immune microenvironment remodeling and response to HER2-targeted therapy in HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer.,"Combination therapy with anti-HER2 agents and immunotherapy has demonstrated significant clinical benefits in gastric cancer (GC), but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we used multiplex immunohistochemistry to assess the changes of the tumor microenvironment in 47 advanced GC patients receiving anti-HER2 therapy. Additionally, we performed single-cell transcriptional sequencing to investigate potential cell-to-cell communication and molecular mechanisms in four HER2-positive GC baseline samples. We observed that post-treated the infiltration of NK cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and B lymphocytes were significantly higher in patients who benefited from anti-HER2 treatment than baseline. Further spatial distribution analysis demonstrated that the interaction scores between NK cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, B lymphocytes and M2 macrophages, B lymphocytes and Tregs were also significantly higher in benefited patients. Cell-cell communication analysis from scRNA sequencing showed that NK cells utilized CCL3/CCL4-CCR5 to recruit CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration. B lymphocytes employed CD74-APP/COPA/MIF to interact with M2 macrophages, and utilized TNF-FAS/ICOS/TNFRSR1B to interact with Tregs. These cell-cell interactions contribute to inhibit the immune resistance of M2 macrophages and Tregs.

The relation between probiotics and cholesterol-lowering capability has been extensively studied. Lactobacillus acidophilus plays a significant role in affecting host health, and produces multitudinous metabolites, which have prohibitory functions against pathogenic microorganisms. In this study, we identified a cholesterol-lowering strain AM13-1, isolated from a fecal sample obtained from a healthy adult male, and performed comprehensive function analysis by whole-genome analysis and in vitro experiments. Genome analyses of L. acidophilus AM13-1 revealed that carbohydrate and amino acid transport, metabolism, translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis are abundant categories of functional genes. No virulence factors or toxin genes with experimentally verified were found in the genome of strain AM13-1. Besides, plenty of probiotic-related genes were predicted from the L. acidophilus AM13-1 genome, such as cbh, atpA-D, and dltD, with functions related to cholesterol-lowering and acid resistance. And strain AM13-1 showed high-efficiency of bile salt hydrolase activity and the capacity for removing cholesterol with efficiency rates of 70%.

38075858,A toolbox of machine learning software to support microbiome analysis.,"The human microbiome has become an area of intense research due to its potential impact on human health. However, the analysis and interpretation of this data have proven to be challenging due to its complexity and high dimensionality. Machine learning (ML) algorithms can process vast amounts of data to uncover informative patterns and relationships within the data, even with limited prior knowledge. Therefore, there has been a rapid growth in the development of software specifically designed for the analysis and interpretation of microbiome data using ML techniques. These software incorporate a wide range of ML algorithms for clustering, classification, regression, or feature selection, to identify microbial patterns and relationships within the data and generate predictive models.

Traditional biochemical studies had primarily associated ac4C modification with tRNA and rRNA until in 2018, Arango D et al. first reported the presence of ac4C modification on mRNA and demonstrated its critical role in mRNA stability and translation regulation. Furthermore, they established that the ac4C modification on mRNA is mediated by the classical N-acetyltransferase NAT10.

38015106,Age-dependent changes in the gut microbiota and serum metabolome correlate with renal function and human aging.,"Human aging is invariably accompanied by a decline in renal function, a process potentially exacerbated by uremic toxins originating from gut microbes. Based on a registered household Chinese Guangxi longevity cohort (n = 151), we conducted comprehensive profiling of the gut microbiota and serum metabolome of individuals from 22 to 111 years of age and validated the findings in two independent East Asian aging cohorts (Japan aging cohort n = 330, Yunnan aging cohort n = 80), identifying unique age-dependent differences in the microbiota and serum metabolome. We discovered that the influence of the gut microbiota on serum metabolites intensifies with advancing age. Furthermore, mediation analyses unveiled putative causal relationships between the gut microbiota (Escherichia coli, Odoribacter splanchnicus, and Desulfovibrio piger) and serum metabolite markers related to impaired renal function (p-cresol, N-phenylacetylglutamine, 2-oxindole, and 4-aminohippuric acid) and aging. The fecal microbiota transplantation experiment demonstrated that the feces of elderly individuals could influence markers related to impaired renal function in the serum.

38001857,"Associations between the New DNA-Methylation-Based Telomere Length Estimator, the Mediterranean Diet and Genetics in a Spanish Population at High Cardiovascular Risk.","Biological aging is a relevant risk factor for chronic diseases, and several indicators for measuring this factor have been proposed, with telomere length (TL) among the most studied. Oxidative stress may regulate telomere shortening, which is implicated in the increased risk. Using a novel estimator for TL, we examined whether adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), a highly antioxidant-rich dietary pattern, is associated with longer TL. We determined TL using DNA methylation algorithms (DNAmTL) in 414 subjects at high cardiovascular risk from Spain. Adherence to the MedDiet was assessed by a validated score, and genetic variants in candidate genes and at the genome-wide level were analyzed. We observed several significant associations (<i>p</i> < 0.05) between DNAmTL and candidate genes (<i>TERT</i>, <i>TERF2</i>, <i>RTEL1</i>, and <i>DCAF4</i>), contributing to the validity of DNAmTL as a biomarker in this population. Higher adherence to the MedDiet was associated with lower odds of having a shorter TL in the whole sample (OR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.85-0.99; <i>p</i> = 0.049 after fully multivariate adjustment). Nevertheless, this association was stronger in women than in men. Likewise, in women, we observed a direct association between adherence to the MedDiet score and DNAmTL as a continuous variable (beta = 0.015; SE: 0.005; <i>p</i> = 0.003), indicating that a one-point increase in adherence was related to an average increase of 0.015 ± 0.005 kb in TL. Upon examination of specific dietary items within the global score, we found that fruits, fish, ""sofrito"", and whole grains exhibited the strongest associations in women. The novel score combining these items was significantly associated in the whole population. In the genome-wide association study (GWAS), we identified ten polymorphisms at the suggestive level of significance (<i>p</i> < 1 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) for DNAmTL (intergenics, in the <i>IQSEC1</i>, <i>NCAPG2</i>, and <i>ABI3BP</i> genes) and detected some gene-MedDiet modulations on DNAmTL. As this is the first study analyzing the DNAmTL estimator, genetics, and modulation by the MedDiet, more studies are needed to confirm these findings.",Coltell O; Asensio EM; Sorlí JV; Ortega-Azorín C; Fernández-Carrión R; Pascual EC; Barragán R; González JI; Estruch R; Alzate JF; Pérez-Fidalgo A; Portolés O; Ordovas JM; Corella D,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38001857/,0,0,0,0,0,0
37960269,MicroRNA-34a Mediates High-Fat-Induced Hepatic Insulin Resistance by Targeting ENO3.,"The etiology of numerous metabolic disorders is characterized by hepatic insulin resistance (IR). Uncertainty surrounds miR-34a's contribution to high-fat-induced hepatic IR and its probable mechanism. The role and mechanism of miR-34a and its target gene ENO3 in high-fat-induced hepatic IR were explored by overexpressing/suppressing miR-34a and ENO3 levels in in vivo and in vitro experiments. Moreover, as a human hepatic IR model, the miR-34a/ENO3 pathway was validated in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The overexpression of hepatic miR-34a lowered insulin signaling and altered glucose metabolism in hepatocytes. In contrast, reducing miR-34a expression significantly reversed hepatic IR indices induced by palmitic acid (PA)/HFD. ENO3 was identified as a direct target gene of miR-34a. Overexpression of ENO3 effectively inhibited high-fat-induced hepatic IR-related indices both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the expression patterns of members of the miR-34a/ENO3 pathway in the liver tissues of NAFLD patients was in line with the findings of both cellular and animal studies. A high-fat-induced increase in hepatic miR-34a levels attenuates insulin signaling and impairs glucose metabolism by suppressing the expression of its target gene ENO3, ultimately leading to hepatic IR. The miR-34a/ENO3 pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for hepatic IR and related metabolic diseases.",Wang Y; Zhao X; Zhang L; Yang C; Zhang K; Gu Z; Ding H; Li S; Qin J; Chu X,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37960269/,0,0,0,0,0,0
37890592,Effects of DHA on cognitive dysfunction in aging and Alzheimer's disease: The mediating roles of ApoE.,"The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to rise due to the increasing aging population. Among the various genetic factors associated with AD, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a lipid transporter, stands out as the primary genetic risk factor. Specifically, individuals carrying the ApoE4 allele exhibit a significantly higher risk. However, emerging research indicates that dietary factors play a prominent role in modifying the risk of AD. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a prominent ω-3 fatty acid, has garnered considerable attention for its potential to ameliorate cognitive function. The intricate interplay between DHA and the ApoE genotype within the brain, which may influence DHA's utilization and functionality, warrants further investigation. This review meticulously examines experimental and clinical studies exploring the effects of DHA on cognitive decline. Special emphasis is placed on elucidating the role of ApoE gene polymorphism and the underlying mechanisms are discussed. These studies suggest that early DHA supplementation may confer benefits to cognitively normal older adults carrying the ApoE4 gene. However, once AD develops, ApoE4 non-carriers may experience greater benefits compared to ApoE4 carriers, although the overall effectiveness of DHA supplementation at this stage is limited. Potential mechanisms underlying these differential effects may include accelerated DHA catabolism in ApoE4 carriers, impaired transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and compromised lipidation and circulatory function in ApoE4 carriers. Thus, the supplementation of DHA may represent a potential intervention strategy aimed at compensating for these deficiencies in ApoE4 carriers prior to the onset of AD.",Zhang X; Yuan T; Chen X; Liu X; Hu J; Liu Z,Progress in lipid research,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37890592/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37866558,Up-regulation of sortase-dependent pili in Bifidobacterium longum BBMN68 in response to bile stress enhances its adhesion to HT-29 cells.,"Adhesion to gastrointestinal tract is crucial for bifidobacteria to exert their probiotic effects. Our previous work found that bile salts significantly enhance the adhesion ability of Bifidobacterium longum BBMN68 to HT-29 cells. In this study, trypsin-shaving and LC-MS/MS-based surface proteomics were employed to identify surface proteins involved in bile stress response. Among the 829 differentially expressed proteins, 56 up-regulated proteins with a fold change >1.5 were subjected to further analysis. Notably, the minor pilin subunit FimB was 4.98-fold up-regulated in response to bile stress. In silico analysis and RT-PCR confirmed that gene fimB, fimA and srtC were co-transcribed and contributed to the biosynthesis of sortase-dependent pili Pil1. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy and immunogold electron microscopy assays showed increased abundance and length of Pil1 on BBMN68 under bile stress. As the major pilin subunit FimA serves as adhesion component of Pil1, an inhibition assay using anti-FimA antibodies further confirmed the critical role of Pil1 in mediating the adhesion of BBMN68 to HT-29 cells under bile stress. Our findings suggest that the up-regulation of Pil1 in response to bile stress enhances the adhesion of BBMN68 to intestinal epithelial cells, highlighting a novel mechanism of gut persistence in B. longum strains.",Zhai Z; Xiong Y; Gu Y; Lei Y; An H; Yi H; Zhao L; Ren F; Hao Y,International journal of biological macromolecules,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37866558/,0,0,0,0,0,0
37865354,Integrated analysis of microbiome and host transcriptome reveals the damage/protective mechanism of corn oil and olive oil on the gut health of grouper (♀ Epinephelus fuscoguttatus × ♂ E. lanceolatu).,"As digestive and immune organs of animals, the gut was frequently used to evaluate the health status of aquatic animals. In previous oil source alternatives study, corn oil (CO) had been found to induce gut inflammation, while olive oil (OO) had been found to be effective in protecting intestinal health. Three diets with different oil sources (fish oil, CO, OO) were formulated for an 8-week culture experiment, and it was proposed to combine 16S sequencing and transcriptome sequencing analysis to preliminarily elucidate the damage/protection mechanism of CO and OO on the gut health of grouper (♀ Epinephelus fuscoguttatus × ♂ E. lanceolatu). We found that CO indeed damaged to gut health and destroyed the gut structure, while OO had a positive outcome in protecting the gut structure, promoting digestibility and relieving enteritis. Photobacterium, Romboutsia and Epulopiscium were significantly enriched in OO group and Staphylococcus were significantly enriched in CO group. Transcriptome sequencing further revealed CO could activated Complement and coagulation cascades, Staphylococcus aureus infection, Systemic lupus erythematosus, and Tuberculosis pathways; conversely, OO activated B-cell signaling receptors, promoted B-cell proliferation and apoptosis, and thus activated B-cell signaling pathways to enhance immunity, whereas OO can regulate IL17 signaling pathway and TNF signaling pathway to inhibit NF-κB signaling pathway to reduce pro-inflammatory response. By integrating the microbiome and transcriptome, further identified all differential microorganisms were directly and significantly correlated with differential genes, and Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Romboutsia, Staphylococcus might as the core regulates the expression of differential gene in the organism. These results reveal that different oil sources alter gut gene expression mainly by modulating the composition and abundance of gut microbiota, further regulating the health status of the gut.

37828586,Metagenome-wide analysis uncovers gut microbial signatures and implicates taxon-specific functions in end-stage renal disease.,"The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in regulating host metabolism and producing uremic toxins in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Our objective is to advance toward a holistic understanding of the gut ecosystem and its functional capacity in such patients, which is still lacking. Herein, we explore the gut microbiome of 378 hemodialytic ESRD patients and 290 healthy volunteers from two independent cohorts via deep metagenomic sequencing and metagenome-assembled-genome-based characterization of their feces. Our findings reveal fundamental alterations in the ESRD microbiome, characterized by a panel of 348 differentially abundant species, including ESRD-elevated representatives of Blautia spp., Dorea spp., and Eggerthellaceae, and ESRD-depleted Prevotella and Roseburia species. Through functional annotation of the ESRD-associated species, we uncover various taxon-specific functions linked to the disease, such as antimicrobial resistance, aromatic compound degradation, and biosynthesis of small bioactive molecules. Additionally, we show that the gut microbial composition can be utilized to predict serum uremic toxin concentrations, and based on this, we identify the key toxin-contributing species. Furthermore, our investigation extended to 47 additional non-dialyzed chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, revealing a significant correlation between the abundance of ESRD-associated microbial signatures and CKD progression. This study delineates the taxonomic and functional landscapes and biomarkers of the ESRD microbiome. Understanding the role of gut microbiota in ESRD could open new avenues for therapeutic interventions and personalized treatment approaches in patients with this condition.",Zhang P; Wang X; Li S; Cao X; Zou J; Fang Y; Shi Y; Xiang F; Shen B; Li Y; Fang B; Zhang Y; Guo R; Lv Q; Zhang L; Lu Y; Wang Y; Yu J; Xie Y; Wang R; Chen X; Yu J; Zhang Z; He J; Zhan J; Lv W; Nie Y; Cai J; Xu X; Hu J; Zhang Q; Gao T; Jiang X; Tan X; Xue N; Wang Y; Ren Y; Wang L; Zhang H; Ning Y; Chen J; Zhang L; Jin S; Ren F; Ehrlich SD; Zhao L; Ding X,Genome biology,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37828586/,0,0,0,0,0,0
37824190,Characterizing Precision Nutrition Discourse on Twitter: Quantitative Content Analysis.,"It is possible that tailoring dietary approaches to an individual's genomic profile could provide optimal dietary inputs for biological functioning and support adherence to dietary management protocols. The science required for such nutrigenetic and nutrigenomic profiling is not yet considered ready for broad application by the scientific and medical communities; however, many personalized nutrition products are available in the marketplace, creating the potential for hype and misleading information on social media. Twitter provides a unique big data source that provides real-time information. Therefore, it has the potential to disseminate evidence-based health information, as well as misinformation. We sought to characterize the landscape of precision nutrition content on Twitter, with a specific focus on nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics. We focused on tweet authors, types of content, and presence of misinformation. Twitter Archiver was used to capture tweets from September 1, 2020, to December 1, 2020, using keywords related to nutrition and genetics. A random sample of tweets was coded using quantitative content analysis by 4 trained coders. Codebook-driven, quantified information about tweet authors, content details, information quality, and engagement metrics were compiled and analyzed. The most common categories of tweets were precision nutrition products and nutrigenomic concepts. About a quarter (132/504, 26.2%) of tweet authors presented themselves as science experts, medicine experts, or both. Nutrigenetics concepts most frequently came from authors with science and medicine expertise, and tweets about the influence of genes on weight were more likely to come from authors with neither type of expertise. A total of 14.9% (75/504) of the tweets were noted to contain untrue information; these were most likely to occur in the nutrigenomics concepts topic category. By evaluating social media discourse on precision nutrition on Twitter, we made several observations about the content available in the information environment through which individuals can learn about related concepts and products. Tweet content was consistent with the indicators of medical hype, and the inclusion of potentially misleading and untrue information was common. We identified a contingent of users with scientific and medical expertise who were active in discussing nutrigenomics concepts and products and who may be encouraged to share credible expert advice on precision nutrition and tackle false information as this technology develops.",Batheja S; Schopp EM; Pappas S; Ravuri S; Persky S,Journal of medical Internet research,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37824190/,0,0,0,0,0,0

37784178,"Analysis of strain, sex, and diet-dependent modulation of gut microbiota reveals candidate keystone organisms driving microbial diversity in response to American and ketogenic diets.","The gut microbiota is modulated by a combination of diet, host genetics, and sex effects. The magnitude of these effects and interactions among them is important to understanding inter-individual variability in gut microbiota. In a previous study, mouse strain-specific responses to American and ketogenic diets were observed along with several QTLs for metabolic traits. In the current study, we searched for genetic variants underlying differences in the gut microbiota in response to American and ketogenic diets, which are high in fat and vary in carbohydrate composition, between C57BL/6 J (B6) and FVB/NJ (FVB) mouse strains. Genetic mapping of microbial features revealed 18 loci under the QTL model (i.e., marginal effects that are not specific to diet or sex), 12 loci under the QTL by diet model, and 1 locus under the QTL by sex model. Multiple metabolic and microbial features map to the distal part of Chr 1 and Chr 16 along with eigenvectors extracted from principal coordinate analysis of measures of β-diversity. Bilophila, Ruminiclostridium 9, and Rikenella (Chr 1) were identified as sex- and diet-independent QTL candidate keystone organisms, and Parabacteroides (Chr 16) was identified as a diet-specific, candidate keystone organism in confirmatory factor analyses of traits mapping to these regions. For many microbial features, irrespective of which QTL model was used, diet or the interaction between diet and a genotype were the strongest predictors of the abundance of each microbial trait. Sex, while important to the analyses, was not as strong of a predictor for microbial abundances. These results demonstrate that sex, diet, and genetic background have different magnitudes of effects on inter-individual differences in gut microbiota. Therefore, Precision Nutrition through the integration of genetic variation, microbiota, and sex affecting microbiota variation will be important to predict response to diets varying in carbohydrate composition.

37778510,APOE-Genotype and Insulin Modulate Estimated Effect of Dietary Macronutrients on Cognitive Performance: Panel Analyses in Nondiabetic Older Adults at Risk of Dementia.,"The apolipoprotein E gene (APOE ε-2/3/4, combined as 6 different genotypes: ε-22/23/24/33/34/44) and insulin status modulate dementia risk and play a role in the metabolism of macronutrients. We aimed to examine APOE-genotype and fasting insulin as effect modifiers of the slopes between dietary macronutrients and cognitive performance among older adults at risk of dementia. Panel analyses-with diet and cognition measured at baseline and follow-up at years 1 and 2-were performed in a sub-sample from the FINGER (Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability) trial (n = 676, 60-77 y, 46% females, all nondiabetics). The associations between macronutrients (3-d food records, z-scores) and global cognition (modified Neuropsychological Test Battery, z-score) were analyzed in mixed regression models adjusted for confounders selected a priori. After a gradient was implied by the point estimates in categorical APOE analyses, we investigated a continuous APOE variable [APOE-gradient, coded -1 (for ε-23), -0.5 (ε-24), 0 (ε-33), 1 (ε-34), 2 (ε-44)] as an effect-modifier. At increasing levels of the APOE-gradient, a relatively more favorable slope between diet and cognition was observed for a lower carbohydrate/fat ratio [β = -0.040, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.074, -0.006; P = 0.020 for interaction diet × APOE-gradient), and higher protein (β = 0.075, 95% CI: 0.042, 0.109; P = 9.4 × 10<sup>-6</sup>). Insulin concentration (log-linear) modulated the association between the carbohydrate/fat ratio and cognition by a quadratic interaction (β = -0.016, P = 0.039). Coherent findings for exploratory predictors (fiber, fat subtypes, composite score, metabolic biomarkers) were compatible with published hypotheses of differential dietary adaptation by APOE, with cognition among ε-33 being relatively independent of dietary parameters-implying ""metabolic flexibility."" Antagonistic slopes to cognition for ε-23 (positive) compared with ε-34 and ε-44 (negative) were found for a Higher-carbohydrates-fiber-Lower-fat-protein composite score, even as within-subjects effects. APOE-based precision nutrition appears conceptually promising, but replications in wider samples are warranted, as well as support from trials.

However, the functions of TGR5 in the immune response of fish remain unclear. In this study, the full-length sequence of tgr5 from hybrid grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus ♀ × E. lanceolatus ♂) was cloned, and the function of TGR5 in the immune response was explored. The results showed that the ORF of tgr5 gene in hybrid grouper was 1029 bp and encoded 342 amino acids. Activation of TGR5 by INT-777 significantly decreased the activities and mRNA expression of TNFα and IL1β, whereas inhibition of TGR5 by SBI-115 showed the opposite effect. SBI-115 treatment significantly increased the expression of phosphorylated inhibitor κB α (p-IKBα) protein. After the INT-777 treatment, the concentration of protein kinase C (PKC) and expression of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38a), p38b and p38c, were significantly decreased in vivo. INT-777 agonist significantly decreased the expression of phosphorylated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (p-PI3K) protein and the ratio of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated serine/threonine-protein kinase (p-AKT/AKT).

Inulin has shown the potential to mitigate dysbiosis. However, it remains unclear whether the dietary response varies depending on sex. In the study, we fed 4-month-old APOE4 mice with inulin for 16 weeks and performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing to determine changes in microbiome diversity, taxonomy, and functional gene pathways. We also formed the same experiments with APOE3 mice to identify whether there are APOE-genotype dependent responses to inulin. We found that APOE4 female mice fed with inulin had restored alpha diversity, significantly reduced Escherichia coli and inflammation-associated pathway responses. However, compared with APOE4 male mice, they had less metabolic responses, including the levels of short-chain fatty acids-producing bacteria and the associated kinases, especially those related to acetate and Erysipelotrichaceae. These diet- and sex- effects were less pronounced in the APOE3 mice, indicating that different APOE variants also play a significant role. The findings provide insights into the higher susceptibility of APOE4 females to AD, potentially due to inefficient energy production, and imply the importance of considering precision nutrition for mitigating dysbiosis and AD risk in the future.",Chang YH; Yanckello LM; Chlipala GE; Green SJ; Aware C; Runge A; Xing X; Chen A; Wenger K; Flemister A; Wan C; Lin AL,Scientific reports,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37704738/,0,0,0,0,0,0
37702886,Precision Nutrition and Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction: the Promise of High-Density Lipoproteins.,"Emerging evidence supports the promise of precision nutritional approaches for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. Here, we discuss current findings from precision nutrition trials and studies reporting substantial inter-individual variability in responses to diets and dietary components relevant to CVD outcomes. We highlight examples where early precision nutrition research already points to actionable intervention targets tailored to an individual's biology and lifestyle. Finally, we make the case for high-density lipoproteins (HDL) as a compelling next generation target for precision nutrition aimed at CVD prevention. HDL possesses complex structural features including diverse protein components, lipids, size distribution, extensive glycosylation, and interacts with the gut microbiome, all of which influence HDL's anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and cholesterol efflux properties. Elucidating the nuances of HDL structure and function at an individual level may unlock personalized dietary and lifestyle strategies to optimize HDL-mediated atheroprotection and reduce CVD risk. Recent human studies have demonstrated that HDL particles are key players in the reduction of CVD risk. Our review highlights the role of HDL and the importance of personalized therapeutic approaches to improve their potential for reducing CVD risk. Factors such as diet, genetics, glycosylation, and gut microbiome interactions can modulate HDL structure and function at the individual level. We emphasize that fractionating HDL into size-based subclasses and measuring particle concentration are necessary to understand HDL biology and for developing the next generation of diagnostics and biomarkers. These discoveries underscore the need to move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach to HDL management. Precision nutrition strategies that account for personalized metabolic, genetic, and lifestyle data hold promise for optimizing HDL therapies and function to mitigate CVD risk more potently. While human studies show HDL play a key role in reducing CVD risk, recent findings indicate that factors such as diet, genetics, glycosylation, and gut microbes modulate HDL function at the individual level, underscoring the need for precision nutrition strategies that account for personalized variability to optimize HDL's potential for mitigating CVD risk.",Hong BV; Agus JK; Tang X; Zheng JJ; Romo EZ; Lei S; Zivkovic AM,Current atherosclerosis reports,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37702886/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37540026,Diallyl trisulfide ameliorates bone loss and alters specific gut microbiota and serum metabolites in natural aging mice.,"Aging is a major cause of bone loss and osteoporosis. Diallyl trisulfide (DATS), one of the main organic sulfides in garlic oil, has been shown to alleviate arthritis in mice. However, further research is still needed to determine how DATS affects bone formation and bone loss in aging mice. Here, we established a mouse model of natural aging for dietary DATS intervention. DATS treatment improved the bone microstructure, including the disorganized arrangement of bone trabeculae and promoted collagen synthesis, as confirmed by micro-CT and histological analyses. The abundance of beneficial bacteria for bone formation, such as Clostridiaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae, and the microbial diversity and community richness were all altered by DATS, according to 16S rRNA sequencing data. 14 potential biomarkers and 9 important metabolic pathways were examined using serum metabolomics analysis. Additionally, there has been a significant reduction in sphingosine, which is directly associated with bone metabolism. The level of sphingosine and relative abundance of <i>Clostridium</i> were found to be negatively correlated by correlation analysis, indicating that bacteria may regulate bone reconstruction <i>via</i> influencing metabolites. Furthermore, <i>Runx2</i> and <i>β-catenin</i> gene expression levels increased in bones, which may be related to the ameliorative mechanism of DATS.

Participatory action research (PAR) is a promising approach to enhance communication and encourage individuals to adopt healthier behaviors and improve their health. In this study, we explored the feasibility of integrating the photovoice method with citizen science approaches to assess the impact of social and environmental factors on gut microbiota health. In this context, citizen science approaches entailed the involvement of participants in the collection of samples for subsequent analysis, specifically gut microbiome assessment via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We recruited 70 volunteers and organized six photovoice groups based on age and educational background. Participants selected 64 photographs that represented the influence of daily habits on gut microbiota health and created four photovoice themes. Analysis of the gut microbiome using 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified 474 taxa, and in-depth microbial analysis revealed three clusters of people based on gut microbiome diversity and body mass index (BMI). Our findings indicate that participants enhanced their knowledge of gut microbiome health through PAR activities, and we found a correlation between lower microbial diversity, higher BMI, and better achievement of learning outcomes. Using PAR as a methodology is an effective way to increase citizens' awareness and engagement in self-care, maintain healthy gut microbiota, and prevent NCD development. These interventions are particularly beneficial for individuals at higher risk of developing NCDs.",Garcia S; Ordoñez S; López-Molina VM; Lacruz-Pleguezuelos B; Carrillo de Santa Pau E; Marcos-Zambrano LJ,Gut microbes,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37530428/,0,0,0,0,0,0
37492950,"Implications on growth performance, glucose metabolism, PI<sub>3</sub>K/AKT pathway, intestinal flora induced by dietary taurine in a high-carbohydrate diet for grass carp (<i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>).","An 8-week experiment was performed to investigate the influence on growth performance, plasma biochemistry, glucose metabolism and the insulin pathway of supplementation of dietary taurine to a high-carbohydrate diet for grass carp. In this study, fish were fed diets at one of two carbohydrate levels, 31·49 % (positive control) or 38·61 % (T00). The high-carbohydrate basal diet (T00), without taurine, was supplemented with 0·05 % (T05), 0·10 % (T10), 0·15 % (T15) or 0·20 % (T20) taurine, resulting in six isonitrogenous (30·37 %) and isolipidic (2·37 %) experimental diets. The experimental results showed that optimal taurine level improved significantly weight gain, specific growth rate (SGR), feed utilisation, reduced plasma total cholesterol levels, TAG and promoted insulin-like growth factor level. Glucokinase, pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activities showed a quadratic function model with increasing dietary taurine level, while hexokinase, fatty acid synthetase activities exhibited a positive linear trend. Optimal taurine supplementation in high-carbohydrate diet upregulated insulin receptor (<i>Ir</i>), insulin receptor substrate (<i>Irs1</i>), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (<i>pi3k</i>), protein kinase B (<i>akt1</i>), glycogen synthase kinase 3 <i>β</i> (<i>gs3kβ</i>) mRNA level and downregulated insulin-like growth factor (<i>igf-1</i>), insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (<i>igf-1R</i>) and Fork head transcription factor 1 (<i>foxo1</i>) mRNA level. The above results suggested that optimal taurine level could improve growth performance, hepatic capacity for glycolipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity, thus enhancing the utilisation of carbohydrates in grass carp. Based on SGR, dietary optimal tributyrin taurine supplementation in grass carp was estimated to be 0·08 %.",Pan L; Qian J; Liu H; Tan B; Dong X; Yang Q; Chi S; Zhang S,The British journal of nutrition,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37492950/,0,0,0,0,0,0
37458294,Zebrafish as model organisms for toxicological evaluations in the field of food science.,"Food safety has long been an area of concern. The selection of stable and efficient model organisms is particularly important for food toxicology studies. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are small model vertebrates, and 70% of human genes have at least one zebrafish ortholog. Zebrafish have advantages as model organisms due to their short life cycle, strong reproductive ability, easy rearing, and low cost. Zebrafish embryos have the advantage of being sensitive to the breeding environment and thus have been used as biosensors. Zebrafish and their embryos have been widely used for food toxicology assessments. This review provides a systematic and comprehensive summary of food toxicology studies using zebrafish as model organisms. First, we briefly introduce the multidimensional mechanisms and structure-activity relationship studies of food toxicological assessment. Second, we categorize these studies according to eight types of hazards in foods, including mycotoxins, pesticides, antibiotics, heavy metals, endocrine disruptors, food additives, nanoparticles, and other food-related ingredients. Finally, we list the applications of zebrafish in food toxicology studies in line with future research prospects, aiming to provide a valuable reference for researchers in the field of food science.",Hou Y; Liu X; Qin Y; Hou Y; Hou J; Wu Q; Xu W,Comprehensive reviews in food science and food safety,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37458294/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37433354,Synthetic symbiotic bacteria reduces the toxicity of mercury ingested via contaminated food.,"Mercury contamination in food poses a significant threat to human health. In this article, we propose a novel approach to solve this problem by enhancing the function of gut microbiota against mercury using a synthetically engineered bacterial strain. An engineered Escherichia coli biosensor MerR with mercury binding function was introduced into the intestines of mice for colonization, whereafter the mice were challenged with oral mercury. Compared with the control mice and mice colonized with unengineered Escherichia coli, the mice with biosensor MerR cells in their gut showed significantly stronger mercury resistance. Furthermore, mercury distribution analysis revealed that biosensor MerR cells promoted the excretion of oral mercury with feces, thereby blocking the entry of mercury into the mice, decreasing the concentration of mercury in the circulatory system and organs, and, thus, attenuating the toxicity of mercury to the liver, kidneys and intestines. Colonization with the biosensor MerR did not result in significant health problems in the mice, nor were genetic circuit mutations or lateral transfers identified during the experiments, thus demonstrating the safety of this approach. This study elucidates the remarkable promise of synthetic biology for modulating gut microbiota function.",Chen X; Chi J; Liu Y; Du R; Guo M; Xu W,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37433354/,0,0,0,0,0,0
37432488,Effect of High Fat Diet on Disease Development of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and Lifestyle Intervention Strategies.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent endocrine and metabolic disorder that affects premenopausal women. The etiology of PCOS is multifaceted, involving various genetic and epigenetic factors, hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian dysfunction, androgen excess, insulin resistance, and adipose-related mechanisms. High-fat diets (HFDs) has been linked to the development of metabolic disorders and weight gain, exacerbating obesity and impairing the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. This results in increased insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and the release of inflammatory adipokines, leading to heightened fat synthesis and reduced fat breakdown, thereby worsening the metabolic and reproductive consequences of PCOS. Effective management of PCOS requires lifestyle interventions such as dietary modifications, weight loss, physical activity, and psychological well-being, as well as medical or surgical interventions in some cases. This article systematically examines the pathological basis of PCOS and the influence of HFDs on its development, with the aim of raising awareness of the connection between diet and reproductive health, providing a robust approach to lifestyle interventions, and serving as a reference for the development of targeted drug treatments.",Han Y; Wu H; Sun S; Zhao R; Deng Y; Zeng S; Chen J,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37432488/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37423161,Role of metabolomics in the delivery of precision nutrition.,"Precision nutrition aims to deliver personalised dietary advice to individuals based on their personal genetics, metabolism and dietary/environmental exposures. Recent advances have demonstrated promise for the use of omic technologies for furthering the field of precision nutrition. Metabolomics in particular is highly attractive as measurement of metabolites can capture information on food intake, levels of bioactive compounds and the impact of diets on endogenous metabolism. These aspects contain useful information for precision nutrition. Furthermore using metabolomic profiles to identify subgroups or metabotypes is attractive for the delivery of personalised dietary advice. Combining metabolomic derived metabolites with other parameters in prediction models is also an exciting avenue for understanding and predicting response to dietary interventions. Examples include but not limited to role of one carbon metabolism and associated co-factors in blood pressure response. Overall, while evidence exists for potential in this field there are also many unanswered questions. Addressing these and clearly demonstrating that precision nutrition approaches enable adherence to healthier diets and improvements in health will be key in the near future.",Brennan L; de Roos B,Redox biology,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37423161/,0,0,0,0,0,0
37406891,"Growth, immunity and transcriptome response to different stocking densities in Litopenaeus vannamei.","The effects of different stocking densities on Litopenaeus vannamei were investigated from the aspects of growth performance, immune response and transcriptome in this experiment. L. vannamei (initial body weight: 0.30 ± 0.02 g) were reared for 8 weeks at three stocking densities of 100 (LSD), 200 (MSD) and 300 (HSD) shrimp/m³, respectively. The results showed that the survival rate (SR), final body weight (FBW), weight gain rate (WGR), specific growth ratio (SGR) and protein efficiency ratio (PER) of L. vannamei significantly decreased, while the feed factor (FCR) significantly increased with the increase of stocking density. After Vibrio parahemolyticus infection, the SR of L. vannamei in the HSD group was significantly lower than that in the LSD and MSD groups. Increasing stocking density significantly increased the activities of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and lysozyme (LYS) while significantly decreased the activities of catalase (CAT) and phenol oxidase (PO) in the serum of L. vannamei. Similar changes of the gene expression as the activities of immune enzymes were found in the hemocytes. Pairwise comparison between the LSD, MSD and HSD group in the transcriptome analysis identified that there were 304, 1376 and 2083 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in LSD vs MSD, MSD vs HSD and LSD vs HSD, respectively. Among them, most of the immune-related DEGs were down-regulated and metabolism-related DEGs were up-regulated with the increasing stocking density. In addition, KEGG enrichment pathway analysis revealed that several immune and metabolic related pathways including PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and AMPK signaling pathway were significantly enriched. Of these, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway had the most DEGs and was also the most significantly enriched pathway. Furthermore, 16 DEGs (such as FOXO, PCK2 and CTSC, etc.) and partial immune enzyme activity (such as AST, CAT and PO, etc.) changes were closely correlated with the increase of stocking density when partial immune-related DEGs and immune-related enzymes were analyzed jointly. All these results indicated that changes in stocking density had a significant effect on the growth performance, immunity and transcriptome of L. vannamei.",Yuan H; Xie M; Hu N; Zheng Y; Hou C; Tan B; Shi L; Zhang S,Fish & shellfish immunology,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37406891/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Although the effects of UV radiation on the skin have been extensively reported, studies on the influence of UV radiation on internal organs are still limited. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of UVB exposure on the kidney of mice and to investigate the possible mechanism. In the present study, histopathology changes, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response were used to evaluate the kidney and colon injury induced by UVB exposure. The results showed that the 14-week chronic skin exposure to UVB triggers a kidney injury response characterized by macrophage infiltration, elevated oxidative stress as well as inflammatory and injury markers. The RNA sequencing demonstrated that chronic UVB exposure could alter the kidney transcriptomic profile distinguished by the regulation of genes involved in the Notch signaling pathway, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and ECM-receptor interaction. Besides, chronic UVB exposure also resulted in gut dysbiosis, manifested as colon macrophage infiltration, stimulated inflammatory responses, impaired barrier integrity, and microbiota structural and functional disorders. The Spearman analysis results further revealed a strong correlation between gut microbiota and kidney injury. In conclusion, skin chronic exposure to UVB causes nephritis and gut microbiota dysbiosis in mice, and these findings provide new insight into the underlying risks of chronic UVB exposure to human wellness.",Geng R; Fang J; Kang SG; Huang K; Tong T,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37343920/,0,0,0,0,0,0

37339167,Subclinical atherosclerosis and accelerated epigenetic age mediated by inflammation: a multi-omics study.,"Epigenetic age is emerging as a personalized and accurate predictor of biological age. The aim of this article is to assess the association of subclinical atherosclerosis with accelerated epigenetic age and to investigate the underlying mechanisms mediating this association. Whole blood methylomics, transcriptomics, and plasma proteomics were obtained for 391 participants of the Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis study. Epigenetic age was calculated from methylomics data for each participant. Its divergence from chronological age is termed epigenetic age acceleration. Subclinical atherosclerosis burden was estimated by multi-territory 2D/3D vascular ultrasound and by coronary artery calcification. In healthy individuals, the presence, extension, and progression of subclinical atherosclerosis were associated with a significant acceleration of the Grim epigenetic age, a predictor of health and lifespan, regardless of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Individuals with an accelerated Grim epigenetic age were characterized by an increased systemic inflammation and associated with a score of low-grade, chronic inflammation. Mediation analysis using transcriptomics and proteomics data revealed key pro-inflammatory pathways (IL6, Inflammasome, and IL10) and genes (IL1B, OSM, TLR5, and CD14) mediating the association between subclinical atherosclerosis and epigenetic age acceleration. The presence, extension, and progression of subclinical atherosclerosis in middle-aged asymptomatic individuals are associated with an acceleration in the Grim epigenetic age. Mediation analysis using transcriptomics and proteomics data suggests a key role of systemic inflammation in this association, reinforcing the relevance of interventions on inflammation to prevent cardiovascular disease.",Sánchez-Cabo F; Fuster V; Silla-Castro JC; González G; Lorenzo-Vivas E; Alvarez R; Callejas S; Benguría A; Gil E; Núñez E; Oliva B; Mendiguren JM; Cortes-Canteli M; Bueno H; Andrés V; Ordovás JM; Fernández-Friera L; Quesada AJ; Garcia JM; Rossello X; Vázquez J; Dopazo A; Fernández-Ortiz A; Ibáñez B; Fuster JJ; Lara-Pezzi E,European heart journal,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37339167/,0,0,0,0,0,0
37335395,Behavioral and Psychological Factors Affecting Weight Loss Success.,"There is a large variability between individuals in the weight loss response to any given diet treatment, which fuels interest into personalized or precision nutrition. Although most efforts are directed toward identifying biological or metabolic factors, several behavioral and psychological factors can also be responsible for some of this interindividual variability. There are many factors that can influence the response to dietary weight loss interventions, including factors related to eating behavior (emotional eating, disinhibition, restraint, perceived stress), behaviors and societal norms related to age and sex, psychological and personal factors (motivation, self-efficacy, locus of control, self-concept), and major life events. The success of a weight loss intervention can be influenced by many psychological and behavioral constructs and not merely by physiological factors such as biology and genetics. These factors are difficult to capture accurately and are often overlooked. Future weight loss studies should consider assessing such factors to better understand the underlying reasons for the large interindividual variability to weight loss therapy.",Pigsborg K; Kalea AZ; De Dominicis S; Magkos F,Current obesity reports,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37335395/,1,0,0,0,0,0

In this study, a cholesterol-lowering bacterium, Lactobacillus gasseri TF08-1, was isolated from the feces of a healthy adolescent, and its probiotic potentials were evaluated through genomic mining and in vitro test. The assembled draft genome comprised of 1,974,590 bp and was predicted total of 1,940 CDSs. The annotation of the genome revealed that L. gasseri TF08-1 harbored abundant categories of functional genes in metabolic and information processing. Moreover, strain TF08-1 has capacity to utilize D-Glucose, Sucrose, D-Maltose, Salicin, D-Xylose, D-Cellobiose, D-Mannose, and D-Trehalose, as the carbon source. The safety assessment showed strain TF08-1 contained few antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factors and was only resistant to 2 antibiotics detected by antimicrobial susceptibility test. A high bile salt hydrolase activity was found and a cholesterol-reducing effect was determined in vitro, which the result showed a remarkable cholesterol removal capability of L. gasseri TF08-1 with an efficiency of 84.40 %.

Next, the probiotic properties of LV1 were evaluated with susceptibility tests, tolerance tests, and whole genome sequencing in vivo and in vitro, followed by the analysis of the effect of LV1 on the growth performance, immune response, and disease resistance of Litopenaeus vannamei. According to the results, the 16 S rDNA sequence of LV1 was 100% homolofgous to the reference sequence of Clostridium butyricum. Moreover, LV1 was resistant to several antibiotics including amikacin, streptomycin, and gentamicin and highly tolerated artificial gastric and artificial intestinal fluids.

37111049,Age-Related Mucus Barrier Dysfunction in Mice Is Related to the Changes in Muc2 Mucin in the Colon.,"During aging, the protective function of mucus barrier is significantly reduced among which changes in colonic mucus barrier function received the most attention. Additionally, the incidence of colon-related diseases increases significantly in adulthood, posing a threat to the health of the elderly. However, the specific changes in colonic mucus barrier with aging and the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. To understand the effects of aging on the colonic mucus barrier, changes in the colonic mucus layer were evaluated in mice aged 2, 12, 18, and 24 months. Microbial invasion, thickness, and structure of colonic mucus in mice at different months of age were analyzed by in situ hybridization fluorescence staining, AB/PAS staining, and cryo-scanning electron microscopy. Results showed that the aged colon exhibited intestinal mucus barrier dys-function and altered mucus properties. During aging, microorganisms invaded the mucus layer to reach epithelial cells. Compared with young mice, the thickness of mucus layer in aged mice in-creased by 11.66 μm. And the contents of the main components and glycosylation structure of colon changed. Among them, the proportion of goblet cells decreased significantly in older mice, and the expression of spdef genes that regulate goblet cell differentiation decreased. Further, the expression of key enzymes involved in mucin core structure formation and glycan modification also changed with aging. The expression of core 1 β1,3-galactosyltransferase (C1GalT1) which is the key enzyme forming the main core structure increased by one time, while core 2 β1,6 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (C2GnT) and core 3 β1,3 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (C3GnT) decreased 2 to 6- and 2-fold, respectively. Also, the expression of sialyltransferase, one of the mucin-glycan modifying enzymes, was decreased by 1-fold. Overall, our results indicate that the goblet cells/glycosyltransferase/O-glycan axis plays an important role in maintaining the physicochemical properties of colonic mucus and the stability of intestinal environment.",Sang X; Wang Q; Ning Y; Wang H; Zhang R; Li Y; Fang B; Lv C; Zhang Y; Wang X; Ren F,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37111049/,0,0,0,0,0,0

37080959,LncRNA modulates Hippo-YAP signaling to reprogram iron metabolism.,"Iron metabolism dysregulation is tightly associated with cancer development. But the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Increasing evidence has shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in various metabolic processes via integrating signaling pathway. In this study, we revealed one iron-triggered lncRNA, one target of YAP, LncRIM (LncRNA Related to Iron Metabolism, also named ZBED5-AS1 and Loc729013), which effectively links the Hippo pathway to iron metabolism and is largely independent on IRP2. Mechanically, LncRIM directly binds NF2 to inhibit NF2-LATS1 interaction, which causes YAP activation and increases intracellular iron level via DMT1 and TFR1. Additionally, LncRIM-NF2 axis mediates cellular iron metabolism dependent on the Hippo pathway. Clinically, high expression of LncRIM correlates with poor patient survival, suggesting its potential use as a biomarker and therapeutic target. Taken together, our study demonstrated a novel mechanism in which LncRIM-NF2 axis facilitates iron-mediated feedback loop to hyperactivate YAP and promote breast cancer development.",He XY; Fan X; Qu L; Wang X; Jiang L; Sang LJ; Shi CY; Lin S; Yang JC; Yang ZZ; Lei K; Li JH; Ju HQ; Yan Q; Liu J; Wang F; Shao J; Xiong Y; Wang W; Lin A,Nature communications,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37080959/,0,0,0,0,0,0

We included 672 adult participants with overweight or obesity, who participated in a 2-year randomized weight-loss dietary intervention study. We defined the regional DNAm levels as the average methylation level of 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' within 500 bp of <i>LINC00319</i> (cg01820192), <i>ATP2B1</i> (cg00508575), and <i>LMNA</i> (cg12593793), respectively. Generalized linear regression models were used to assess the association between the regional DNAm and 2-year blood pressure changes. Trajectory analysis was used to identify subgroups that shared a similar underlying trajectory of 2-year blood pressure changes. The regional DNAm at <i>LINC00319</i>, showed significantly different associations with 2-year changes in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure among participants assigned to low- or high-fat diets (<i>P</i> for interaction<0.05 for all). In response to the low-fat diet, per SD higher regional DNAm at <i>LINC00319</i> was associated with greater reductions in both 2-year changes in systolic blood pressure (β, -1.481; <i>P</i>=0.020) and diastolic blood pressure (β, -1.096; <i>P</i>=0.009). Three trajectories of changes in systolic blood pressure or diastolic blood pressure were identified, and participants with higher regional DNAm at <i>LINC00319</i> were more likely to experience and maintain decreased systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure (odds ratio of being in decrease-stable versus stable [95% CI], 1.542 [1.146-2.076] and 1.463 [1.125-1.902]).

36939762,Mitochondria as the Essence of Yang Qi in the Human Body.,"The concept of Yang Qi in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has many similarities with mitochondria in modern medicine. Both are indispensable to human beings and closely related to life and death. This article discusses the similarities in various aspects between mitochondria and Yang Qi, including body temperature, aging, newborns, circadian rhythm, immunity, and meridian. It is well-known that Yang Qi is vital for human health. Interestingly, decreased mitochondrial function is thought to be key to the development of various diseases. Here, we further explain diseases induced by Yang Qi deficiency, such as cancer, chronic fatigue syndrome, sleep disorder, senile dementia, and metabolic diseases, from the perspective of mitochondrial function. We aim to establish similarities and connections between two important concepts, and hope our essay can stimulate further discussion and investigation on unifying important concepts in western medicine and alternative medicine, especially TCM, and provide unique holistic insights into understanding human health.",Luo J; Shen S; Xia J; Wang J; Gu Z,"Phenomics (Cham, Switzerland)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36939762/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36904081,To Fiber or Not to Fiber: The Swinging Pendulum of Fiber Supplementation in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Evidence-based dietary guidance around dietary fiber in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been limited owing to insufficient reproducibility in intervention trials. However, the pendulum has swung because of our increased understanding of the importance of fibers in maintaining a health-associated microbiome. Preliminary evidence suggests that dietary fiber can alter the gut microbiome, improve IBD symptoms, balance inflammation, and enhance health-related quality of life. Therefore, it is now more vital than ever to examine how fiber could be used as a therapeutic strategy to manage and prevent disease relapse. At present, there is limited knowledge about which fibers are optimal and in what form and quantity they should be consumed to benefit patients with IBD. Additionally, individual microbiomes play a strong role in determining the outcomes and necessitate a more personalized nutritional approach to implementing dietary changes, as dietary fiber may not be as benign as once thought in a dysbiotic microbiome. This review describes dietary fibers and their mechanism of action within the microbiome, details novel fiber sources, including resistant starches and polyphenols, and concludes with potential future directions in fiber research, including the move toward precision nutrition.",Haskey N; Gold SL; Faith JJ; Raman M,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36904081/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36873949,The impact of alcoholic drinks and dietary factors on epigenetic markers associated with triglyceride levels.,"<b>Background:</b> Many epigenetic loci have been associated with plasma triglyceride (TG) levels, but epigenetic connections between those loci and dietary exposures are largely unknown. This study aimed to characterize the epigenetic links between diet, lifestyle, and TG. <b>Methods:</b> We first conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) for TG in the Framingham Heart Study Offspring population (FHS, <i>n</i> = 2,264). We then examined relationships between dietary and lifestyle-related variables, collected four times in 13 years, and differential DNA methylation sites (DMSs) associated with the last TG measures. Third, we conducted a mediation analysis to evaluate the causal relationships between diet-related variables and TG. Finally, we replicated three steps to validate identified DMSs associated with alcohol and carbohydrate intake in the Genetics of Lipid-Lowering Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN) study (<i>n</i> = 993). <b>Results:</b> In the FHS, the EWAS revealed 28 TG-associated DMSs at 19 gene regions. We identified 102 unique associations between these DMSs and one or more dietary and lifestyle-related variables. Alcohol and carbohydrate intake showed the most significant and consistent associations with 11 TG-associated DMSs. Mediation analyses demonstrated that alcohol and carbohydrate intake independently affect TG <i>via</i> DMSs as mediators. Higher alcohol intake was associated with lower methylation at seven DMSs and higher TG. In contrast, increased carbohydrate intake was associated with higher DNA methylation at two DMSs (<i>CPT1A</i> and <i>SLC7A11</i>) and lower TG. Validation in the GOLDN further supports the findings. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings imply that TG-associated DMSs reflect dietary intakes, particularly alcoholic drinks, which could affect the current cardiometabolic risk <i>via</i> epigenetic changes. This study illustrates a new method to map epigenetic signatures of environmental factors for disease risk. Identification of epigenetic markers of dietary intake can provide insight into an individual's risk of cardiovascular disease and support the application of precision nutrition. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> www.ClinicalTrials.gov, the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), NCT00005121; the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN), NCT01023750.",Lai CQ; Parnell LD; Lee YC; Zeng H; Smith CE; McKeown NM; Arnett DK; Ordovás JM,Frontiers in genetics,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36873949/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36834337,DNA-Methylation Signatures of Tobacco Smoking in a High Cardiovascular Risk Population: Modulation by the Mediterranean Diet.,"Biomarkers based on DNA methylation are relevant in the field of environmental health for precision health. Although tobacco smoking is one of the factors with a strong and consistent impact on DNA methylation, there are very few studies analyzing its methylation signature in southern European populations and none examining its modulation by the Mediterranean diet at the epigenome-wide level. We examined blood methylation smoking signatures on the EPIC 850 K array in this population (n = 414 high cardiovascular risk subjects). Epigenome-wide methylation studies (EWASs) were performed analyzing differential methylation CpG sites by smoking status (never, former, and current smokers) and the modulation by adherence to a Mediterranean diet score was explored. Gene-set enrichment analysis was performed for biological and functional interpretation. The predictive value of the top differentially methylated CpGs was analyzed using receiver operative curves. We characterized the DNA methylation signature of smoking in this Mediterranean population by identifying 46 differentially methylated CpGs at the EWAS level in the whole population. The strongest association was observed at the cg21566642 (<i>p</i> = 2.2 × 10<sup>-32</sup>) in the 2q37.1 region. We also detected other CpGs that have been consistently reported in prior research and discovered some novel differentially methylated CpG sites in subgroup analyses. In addition, we found distinct methylation profiles based on the adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Particularly, we obtained a significant interaction between smoking and diet modulating the cg5575921 methylation in the AHRR gene. In conclusion, we have characterized biomarkers of the methylation signature of tobacco smoking in this population, and suggest that the Mediterranean diet can increase methylation of certain hypomethylated sites.",Fernández-Carrión R; Sorlí JV; Asensio EM; Pascual EC; Portolés O; Alvarez-Sala A; Francès F; Ramírez-Sabio JB; Pérez-Fidalgo A; Villamil LV; Tinahones FJ; Estruch R; Ordovas JM; Coltell O; Corella D,International journal of environmental research and public health,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36834337/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36778219,"Analysis of strain, sex, and diet-dependent modulation of gut microbiota reveals candidate keystone organisms driving microbial diversity in response to American and ketogenic diets.","Background The gut microbiota is modulated by a combination of diet, host genetics, and sex effects. The magnitude of these effects and interactions among them is important to understanding inter-individual variability in gut microbiota. In a previous study, mouse strain-specific responses to American and ketogenic diets were observed along with several QTL for metabolic traits. In the current study, we searched for genetic variants underlying differences in the gut microbiota in response to American and ketogenic diets, which are high in fat and vary in carbohydrate composition, between C57BL/6J (B6) and FVB/NJ (FVB) mouse strains. Results Genetic mapping of microbial features revealed 18 loci under the QTL model (i.e., marginal effects that are not specific to diet or sex), 12 loci under the QTL by diet model, and 1 locus under the QTL by sex model. Multiple metabolic and microbial features map to the distal part of Chr 1 and Chr 16 along with eigenvectors extracted from principal coordinate analysis of measures of β-diversity. <i>Bilophila</i> , <i>Ruminiclostridium 9</i> , and <i>Rikenella</i> (Chr 1) were identified as sex and diet independent QTL candidate keystone organisms and <i>Rikenelleceae RC9 Gut Group</i> (Chr 16) was identified as a diet-specific, candidate keystone organism in confirmatory factor analyses of traits mapping to these regions. For many microbial features, irrespective of which QTL model was used, diet or the interaction between diet and a genotype were the strongest predictors of the abundance of each microbial trait. Sex, while important to the analyses, was not as strong of a predictor for microbial abundances. Conclusions These results demonstrate that sex, diet, and genetic background have different magnitudes of effects on inter-individual differences in gut microbiota. Therefore, Precision Nutrition through the integration of genetic variation, microbiota, and sex affecting microbiota variation will be important to predict response to diets varying in carbohydrate composition.",Salvador AC; Huda MN; Arends D; Elsaadi AM; Gacasan AC; Brockmann GA; Valdar W; Bennett BJ; Threadgill DW,Research square,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36778219/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36678130,Gut Microbiota and Time-Restricted Feeding/Eating: A Targeted Biomarker and Approach in Precision Nutrition.,"Each individual has a unique gut microbiota; therefore, the genes in our microbiome outnumber the genes in our genome by about 150 to 1. Perturbation in host nutritional status influences gut microbiome composition and vice versa. The gut microbiome can help in producing vitamins, hormones, and other active metabolites that support the immune system; harvest energy from food; aid in digestion; protect against pathogens; improve gut transit and function; send signals to the brain and other organs; oscillate the circadian rhythm; and coordinate with the host metabolism through multiple cellular pathways. Gut microbiota can be influenced by host genetics, medications, diet, and lifestyle factors from preterm to aging. Aligning with precision nutrition, identifying a personalized microbiome mandates the provision of the right nutrients at the right time to the right patient. Thus, before prescribing a personalized treatment, it is crucial to monitor and count the gut flora as a focused biomarker. Many nutritional approaches that have been developed help in maintaining and restoring an optimal microbiome such as specific diet therapy, nutrition interventions, and customized eating patterns. One of these approaches is time-restricted feeding/eating (TRF/E), a type of intermittent fasting (IF) in which a subject abstains from food intake for a specific time window. Such a dietary modification might alter and restore the gut microbiome for proper alignment of cellular and molecular pathways throughout the lifespan. In this review, we have highlighted that the gut microbiota would be a targeted biomarker and TRF/E would be a targeted approach for restoring the gut-microbiome-associated molecular pathways such as hormonal signaling, the circadian system, metabolic regulators, neural responses, and immune-inflammatory pathways. Consequently, modulation of the gut microbiota through TRF/E could contribute to proper utilization and availability of the nutrients and in this way confer protection against diseases for harnessing personalized nutrition approaches to improve human health.",Zeb F; Osaili T; Obaid RS; Naja F; Radwan H; Cheikh Ismail L; Hasan H; Hashim M; Alam I; Sehar B; Faris ME,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36678130/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36651176,Mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 regulates fatty acid synthase lactylation and mediates treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.,"NAFLD has become a major metabolic disease worldwide. A few studies have reported the potential relationship between mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 (MPC1) and inflammation, fibrosis, and insulin sensitivity in obese or NASH mouse models. However, the impact of MPC1 on NAFLD-related liver lipid metabolism and its role in the NAFLD progression require further investigation. MPC1 expression was measured in liver tissues from normal controls and patients with NAFLD. We characterized the metabolic phenotypes and expression of genes involved in hepatic lipid accumulation in MPC1 systemic heterozygous knockout (MPC1 +/- ) mice. Hepatic protein lactylation was detected using Tandem Mass Tags proteomics and verified by the overexpression of lactylation mutants in cells. Finally, the effect of MPC1 inhibition on liver inflammation was examined in mice and AML-12 cells. Here, we found that MPC1 expression was positively correlated to liver lipid deposition in patients with NAFLD. MPC1 +/- mice fed with high-fat diet had reduced hepatic lipid accumulation but no change in the expression of lipid synthesis-related genes. MPC1 knockout affected the lactylation of several proteins, especially fatty acid synthase, through the regulation of lactate levels in hepatocytes. Lactylation at the K673 site of fatty acid synthase inhibited fatty acid synthase activity, which mediated the downregulation of liver lipid accumulation by MPC1. Moreover, although MPC1 knockout caused lactate accumulation, inflammation level was controlled because of mitochondrial protection and macrophage polarization. In NAFLD, MPC1 levels are positively correlated with hepatic lipid deposition; the enhanced lactylation at fatty acid synthase K673 site may be a downstream mechanism.",Gao R; Li Y; Xu Z; Zhang F; Xu J; Hu Y; Yin J; Yang K; Sun L; Wang Q; He X; Huang K,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36651176/,0,0,0,0,0,0

L. vannamei with an initial body weight of 0.30 ± 0.02 g were fed a diet containing LPS at doses of 0, 0.2, 1, 5, 25 or 125 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> for eight weeks (groups LPS0, LPS0.2, LPS1, LPS5, LPS25 and LPS125, respectively). After eight weeks of feeding, the growth performance, immunity and transcriptome response of L. vannamei were analysed. Only dietary LPS at 0.2 and 1 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> resulted in a significant increase in the growth of L. vannamei (P < 0.05). According to the weight gain rate (WGR) and specific growth rate (SGR), the optimum dietary LPS level was 2.462 and 2.455 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. When compared with the control group, the survival rate (SR) of L. vannamei in the LPS0.2 group was significantly increased after white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection and the SR of L. vannamei in the LPS1 group was significantly increased after Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection (both P < 0.05). Compared with the LPS0 group, immune enzyme activity in the serum of L. vannamei could be significantly increased and the content of maleic dialdehyde (MDA) significantly decreased by dietary LPS. Transcriptome analysis of the haemocytes of L. vannamei identified 399 up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 5000 down-regulated DEGs in the LPS0.2 compared to the control group. Most of the DEGs were significantly enriched in the following pathways: phosphatidylinositol signalling, Wnt signalling, Jak-STAT signalling and inositol phosphate metabolism. In conclusion, this study revealed that diets supplemented with low-dose LPS had positive effects on the growth and immunity of L. vannamei.",Yan Z; Zhu L; Hou C; Zheng Y; Guo H; Shi L; Tan B; Zhang S,Fish & shellfish immunology,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36603789/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36596335,A genome-wide computational approach to define microRNA-Polycomb/trithorax gene regulatory circuits in Drosophila.,"Characterization of gene regulatory networks is fundamental to understanding homeostatic development. This process can be simplified by analyzing relatively simple genomes such as the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. In this work we have developed a computational framework in Drosophila to explore for the presence of gene regulatory circuits between two large groups of transcriptional regulators: the epigenetic group of the Polycomb/trithorax (PcG/trxG) proteins and the microRNAs (miRNAs). We have searched genome-wide for miRNA targets in PcG/trxG transcripts as well as for Polycomb Response Elements (PREs) in miRNA genes. Our results show that 10% of the analyzed miRNAs could be controlling PcG/trxG gene expression, while 40% of those miRNAs are putatively controlled by the selected set of PcG/trxG proteins. The integration of these analyses has resulted in the predicted existence of 3 classes of miRNA-PcG/trxG crosstalk interactions that define potential regulatory circuits. In the first class, miRNA-PcG circuits are defined by miRNAs that reciprocally crosstalk with PcG. In the second, miRNA-trxG circuits are defined by miRNAs that reciprocally crosstalk with trxG. In the third class, miRNA-PcG/trxG shared circuits are defined by miRNAs that crosstalk with both PcG and trxG regulators. These putative regulatory circuits may uncover a novel mechanism in Drosophila for the control of PcG/trxG and miRNAs levels of expression. The computational framework developed here for Drosophila melanogaster can serve as a model case for similar analyses in other species. Moreover, our work provides, for the first time, a new and useful resource for the Drosophila community to consult prior to experimental studies investigating the epigenetic regulatory networks of miRNA-PcG/trxG mediated gene expression.",Solorzano J; Carrillo-de Santa Pau E; Laguna T; Busturia A,Developmental biology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36596335/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36501145,Association between Dietary Behaviors and BMI Stratified by Sex and the <i>ALDH2</i> rs671 Polymorphism in Japanese Adults.,"The rs671 polymorphism, unique to East Asians, is well known to change the sensitivity to alcohol. Moreover, this polymorphism is associated not only with alcohol intake but also with several dietary behaviors (DBs), chronic diseases, and BMI, but the triadic association among the rs671 genotype, DBs, and BMI is unclear. This study included 12,271 Japanese subjects and aimed to observe this three-way association using the rs671 polymorphism, data of 56 DBs, and BMI. All analyses were stratified by participant sex. First, linear regression analyses resulted in significant associations between 18 and 21 DBs and BMI in males and females, respectively. Next, genetic heterogeneity was observed in all sub-groups via interaction analysis of the rs671 genotype stratified by drinking habits. Finally, we observed the characteristics of BMI-related DBs based on the rs671 genotype via stepwise regression analyses stratified by the rs671 genotype and drinking habits. Notably, positive associations were observed between <i>lactobacillus</i> beverage intake and BMI among participants with the rs671 polymorphism AA genotype in both sexes. This study suggests that the rs671 polymorphism modifies the association between DBs and BMI independently of drinking habits, providing evidence for the potential use of rs671 polymorphism information for precision nutrition with East Asians.",Igarashi M; Nogawa S; Hachiya T; Furukawa K; Takahashi S; Jia H; Saito K; Kato H,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36501145/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Diagnosis and treatment for PA have always remained huge challenges due to its multiple triggers. Studies have shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a critical role in the development of allergic diseases. In the current study, we examined the plasma lncRNA expression profiles of peanut allergy Brown Norway rats and healthy controls and 496 differently expressed lncRNAs were identified, including 411 up-regulated genes and 85 down-regulated genes. We screened 8 lncRNAs based on the candidate principle and the candidates were verified in individual samples by quantitative real-time PCR. Then, the four lncRNA-based diagnostic model was established by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and logistic regression, which was proved by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

36477300,In vivo promotion of primordial follicle activation by stem cell factor treatment in mice with premature ovarian insufficiency and advanced age.,"Dormant primordial follicles (PFs) are the most abundant reproductive resource in mammalian ovaries. With advances in the mechanism of study of the regulation of PF activation, PFs have been used to improve fertility in clinical practice. As a central controlling element of follicle activation signaling, the pre-granulosa cell-secreted stem cell factor (SCF; also known as KIT ligand, KITL), which initiates the growth of dormant oocytes, is an ideal natural activator that stimulates follicle activation. However, no systematic study has been conducted to identify the activating effect of SCF in vivo and in vitro. In this study, by combining an in vitro whole ovary culture system and several mouse models, we provide a series of experimental evidence that SCF is an efficient activator for improving PF activation in mouse ovaries. Our in vitro study showed that SCF increased phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling and PF activation ratio in neonatal ovaries. In vivo ovarian non-invasive topical administrations of SCF to the ovaries efficiently improved follicle activation and development, oocyte retrieval ratio and fertility in inducible premature ovarian insufficiency mouse models and aged mice. Our study suggests that SCF is an efficient growth factor that can be applied to improve PF activation.",Wang Y; Zhang J; Liang J; Jia L; Niu S; Cheng K; Yang C; Lu Z; Mu L; Yang X; Zhang Y; Zhang H,Molecular human reproduction,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36477300/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36461678,One-Pot Controllable Assembly of a Baicalin-Condensed Aptamer Nanodrug for Synergistic Anti-Obesity.,"The rapid, simple and low-cost preparation of DNA micro-nano-architectures remain challenging in biosensing and therapy. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-driven DNA micro-nano-flowers are used to construct a nanosized baicalin-compressed-aptamer-nanodrug (bcaND) via one-pot assembly for targeted and synergistic anti-obesity. In the design, the tailored Adipo-8 (tAdi-8) overhang in the PCR amplicon displays anti-obesity targeting activity, while the baicalin loaded in the bcaND by embedding the amplicon plays a three-fold role as a lipid-lowering factor, bcaND size compressor, and uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1)-raised thermogenic activator. The ingenious bcaND represents an advanced multifunctional nanomaterial capable of adjusting the morphology at an optimal 400/1 molar ratio of Mg<sup>2+</sup> to phosphate groups, compressing the size from 2.699 µm to 214.76 nm using 1 mg/mL baicalin at a temperature of 70 °C, an effective payload with amplicons of up to 98.94%, and a maximum baicalin load of 86.21 g/g DNA.

36455237,Chlorogenic acid improves food allergy through the AMPK/ACC/CPT-1 pathway.,"Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a polyphenol prevalent in daily food and plants. Food allergy (FA) can lead to metabolic disorders of the immune system. The objective of this study was to investigate CGA therapeutic effect on FA and regulatory mechanism through shrimp food allergy in mice models. Here, 24 female BALB/C mice were randomly allocated into the (I) Control group, (II) Food allergy group, (III) Chlorogenic acid low (50 mg/kg), and (IV) high group (200 mg/kg). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that CGA decreased levels of IgE and IgG induced by food allergy significantly. Real-time PCR demonstrated that high-dose chlorogenic acid significantly reduced Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) mRNA expression and increased Carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) mRNA expression. Western blot indicated that CGA promoted a noticeable increase at the levels of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and ACC phosphorylation, resulting in a significant activation in AMPK and inhibition in ACC, and increased CPT-1 expression. Consequently, CGA improves FA by the regulation of the AMPK/ACC/CPT-1 signaling pathway in the spleen. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Chlorogenic acid is a water-soluble polyphenolic substance that is widely distributed in natural plants that show a variety of pharmacological effects. At present, CGA has been developed as a weigh-reducing tonic in western countries. As one of the most widely found and most easily obtained phenolic acids from food, the diverse physiological effects of CGA (such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, metabolic regulation, intestinal microbial regulation, etc.) imply its potential for application in functional foods, food additives, and clinical medicine. However, the basic molecular mechanisms of its effects have not been elucidated. In this study, CGA reduced allergy in a mouse model, likely by interacting with the AMPK/ACC/CPT-1 pathway.",Yun Z; Zou Z; Sun S; Che H,Journal of food biochemistry,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36455237/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36421817,Multi-Omics Nutritional Approaches Targeting Metabolic-Associated Fatty Liver Disease.,"Currently, metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a leading global cause of chronic liver disease, and is expected to become one of the most common indications of liver transplantation. MAFLD is associated with obesity, involving multiple mechanisms such as alterations in lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, hyperinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, and extracellular matrix formation. However, the onset and progression of MAFLD is variable among individuals, being influenced by intrinsic (personal) and external environmental factors. In this context, sequence structural variants across the human genome, epigenetic phenomena (i.e., DNA methylation, histone modifications, and long non-coding RNAs) affecting gene expression, gut microbiota dysbiosis, and metabolomics/lipidomic fingerprints may account for differences in MAFLD outcomes through interactions with nutritional features. This knowledge may contribute to gaining a deeper understanding of the molecular and physiological processes underlying MAFLD pathogenesis and phenotype heterogeneity, as well as facilitating the identification of biomarkers of disease progression and therapeutic targets for the implementation of tailored nutritional strategies. This comprehensive literature review highlights the potential of nutrigenetic, nutriepigenetic, nutrimetagenomic, nutritranscriptomics, and nutrimetabolomic approaches for the prevention and management of MAFLD in humans through the lens of precision nutrition.",Ramos-Lopez O,Genes,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36421817/,1,0,0,0,0,0

To achieve a broader understanding of the role of the intestinal microbiota in patients with AN, we collected fecal samples before and following clinical treatment at two geographically distinct eating disorder units (Center of Excellence for Eating Disorders [UNC-CH] and ACUTE Center for Eating Disorders [Denver Health]). Gut microbiotas were characterized in patients with AN, before and after inpatient treatment, and in non-eating disorder (non-ED) controls using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. The impact of inpatient treatment on the AN gut microbiota was remarkably consistent between eating disorder units. Although weight in patients with AN showed improvements, AN microbiotas post-treatment remained distinct from non-ED controls. Additionally, AN gut microbiotas prior to treatment exhibited more fermentation pathways and a lower ability to degrade carbohydrates than non-ED controls. As the intestinal microbiota can influence nutrient metabolism, our data highlight the complex microbial communities in patients with AN as an element needing further attention post inpatient treatment. Additionally, this study defines the effects of renourishment on the AN gut microbiota and serves as a platform to develop precision nutrition approaches to potentially mitigate impediments to recovery.",Fouladi F; Bulik-Sullivan EC; Glenny EM; Thornton LM; Reed KK; Thomas S; Kleiman S; Watters A; Oakes J; Huh EY; Tang Q; Liu J; Djukic Z; Harper L; Trillo-Ordoñez Y; Sun S; Blakely I; Mehler PS; Fodor AA; Tarantino LM; Bulik CM; Carroll IM,Gut microbes,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36398862/,0,0,0,0,0,0

For identification of molecular events driving the pathogenesis of T-LGLL, we compared the differentially methylated loci between the T-LGLL cases and normal T cells with chromatin segmentation data of benign T cells from the BLUEPRINT project. Moreover, we analyzed gene expression data of T-LGLL and benign T cells and validated the results by pyrosequencing in an extended cohort of 17 patients, including five patients with sequential samples. We identified dysregulation of DNA methylation associated with altered gene expression in T-LGLL. Since T-LGLL is a rare disease, the samples size is low. But as confirmed for each sample, hypermethylation of T-LGLL cells at various CpG sites located at enhancer regions is a hallmark of this disease. The interaction of BLC11B and C14orf64 as suggested by in silico data analysis could provide a novel pathogenetic mechanism that needs further experimental investigation. DNA methylation is altered in T-LGLL cells compared to benign T cells. In particular, BCL11B is highly significant differentially methylated in T-LGLL cells. Although our results have to be validated in a larger patient cohort, BCL11B could be considered as a potential biomarker for this leukemia. In addition, altered gene expression and hypermethylation of enhancer regions could serve as potential mechanisms for treatment of this disease. Gene interactions of dysregulated genes, like BLC11B and C14orf64, may play an important role in pathogenic mechanisms and should be further analyzed.",Johansson P; Laguna T; Ossowski J; Pancaldi V; Brauser M; Dührsen U; Keuneke L; Queiros A; Richter J; Martín-Subero JI; Siebert R; Schlegelberger B; Küppers R; Dürig J; Murga Penas EM; Carillo-de Santa Pau E; Bergmann AK,Clinical epigenetics,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36376973/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36361733,<i>APOE</i> Genotypes Modulate Inflammation Independently of Their Effect on Lipid Metabolism.,"The association between <i>APOE</i> genotypes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is partially mediated by LDL-cholesterol concentration but persists after adjusting for lipid levels and other cardiovascular risk factors. Data from the Aragon Workers Health Study (AWHS) (n = 4159) and the Lipid Unit at the Hospital Universitario Miguel Servet (HUMS) (n = 3705) were used to investigate the relationship between C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and <i>APOE</i> genotype. Lipoprotein particle and GlycA concentrations were analyzed in a subsample from AWHS. <i>APOE</i> genotyping was carried out by the Sanger method in both cohorts. <i>APOE4</i> carriers had significantly lower levels of CRP than <i>APOE3</i> carriers. Furthermore, <i>APOE</i>4 carriers had cholesterol-enriched LDL particles compared to <i>APOE2</i> carriers. <i>APOE4</i> carriers also had higher concentrations of small, medium, and large LDL particles. CRP levels were not associated with lipoprotein particle number, size, or composition. GlycA levels were not associated with <i>APOE</i> genotypes. However, GlycA levels were significantly associated with the size and the amount of cholesterol contained in HDL, VLDL, and LDL particles. <i>APOE</i> genotype influences CRP concentration regardless of lipid profile. <i>APOE2</i> carriers showed the highest CRP levels, followed by <i>APOE3</i> and <i>APOE4</i>. A more atherogenic lipid profile, but not inflammatory markers could partly explain the higher CVD risk observed in <i>APOE4</i> carriers.",Civeira-Marín M; Cenarro A; Marco-Benedí V; Bea AM; Mateo-Gallego R; Moreno-Franco B; Ordovás JM; Laclaustra M; Civeira F; Lamiquiz-Moneo I,International journal of molecular sciences,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36361733/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36292963,TMAO Upregulates Members of the miR-17/92 Cluster and Impacts Targets Associated with Atherosclerosis.,"Atherosclerosis is a hallmark of cardiovascular disease, and lifestyle strongly impacts its onset and progression. Nutrients have been shown to regulate the miR-17/92 cluster, with a role in endothelial function and atherosclerosis. Choline, betaine, and L-carnitine, found in animal foods, are metabolized into trimethylamine (TMA) by the gut microbiota. TMA is then oxidized to TMAO, which has been associated with atherosclerosis. Our aim was to investigate whether TMAO modulates the expression of the miR-17/92 cluster, along with the impact of this modulation on the expression of target genes related to atherosclerosis and inflammation. We treated HepG-2 cells, THP-1 cells, murine liver organoids, and human peripheral mononuclear cells with 6 µM of TMAO at different timepoints. TMAO increased the expression of all analyzed members of the cluster, except for miR-20a-5p in murine liver organoids and primary human macrophages. Genes and protein levels of SERPINE1 and IL-12A increased. Both have been associated with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CDVD) and are indirectly modulated by the miR-17-92 cluster. We concluded that TMAO modulates the expression of the miR-17/92 cluster and that such modulation could promote inflammation through IL-12A and blood clotting through SERPINE1 expression, which could ultimately promote atherosclerosis and CVD.",Díez-Ricote L; Ruiz-Valderrey P; Micó V; Blanco R; Tomé-Carneiro J; Dávalos A; Ordovás JM; Daimiel L,International journal of molecular sciences,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36292963/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36276637,Identifying the E2F3-MEX3A-KLF4 signaling axis that sustains cancer cells in undifferentiated and proliferative state.,"<b>Rationale:</b> Dysregulation of signaling that governs self-renewal and differentiation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) is a major cause of colorectal cancer (CRC) initiation and progression. <b>Methods:</b> qRT-PCR, western blotting, <i>in situ</i> hybridization, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence assays were used to detect the expression levels of MEX3A, KLF4 and E2F3 in CRC tissues. The biological functions of MEX3A were studied using <i>Mex3a</i> knockout (KO) and intestinal epithelium specific conditional knockout (cKO) mice, AOM-DSS mouse colorectal tumor model, Apc floxed mouse tumor model and intestinal and tumor organoids. Transcriptomic RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), RNA crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) and luciferase reporter assays were performed to explore the molecular mechanisms of MEX3A. <b>Results:</b> RNA-binding protein MEX3A, a specific ISC marker gene, becomes ectopically upregulated upon CRC and its levels negatively correlate with patient survival prognosis. MEX3A functions as an oncoprotein that retains cancer cells in undifferentiated and proliferative status and it enhances their radioresistance to DNA damage. Mechanistically, a rate limiting factor of cellular proliferation E2F3 induces MEX3A, which in turn activates WNT pathway by directly suppressing expression of its pro-differentiation transcription factor KLF4. Knockdown of <i>MEX3A</i> with siRNA or addition of KLF4 agonist significantly suppressed tumor growth both by increasing differentiation status of cancer cells and by suppressing their proliferation. <b>Conclusions:</b> It identifies E2F3-MEX3A-KLF4 axis as an essential coordinator of cancer stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, representing a potent new druggable target for cancer differentiation therapy.",Yang X; Li G; Tian Y; Wang X; Xu J; Liu R; Deng M; Shao C; Pan Y; Wu X; Li M; Zhang C; Liu R; Qin J; Zhang C; Liu Z; Wu X; Plikus MV; Lengner CJ; Zheng Z; Lv C; Yu Z,Theranostics,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36276637/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36210393,"Farnesoid X receptor regulates PI<sub>3</sub>K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, lipid metabolism, and immune response in hybrid grouper.","Some diseases related to lipid metabolism increase yearly in cultured fish, and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a nuclear protein that plays a key role in inflammatory responses and lipid metabolism. However, the roles of FXR in hybrid grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus♀ × E. lanceolatus♂) remain poorly understood. The main objective of this study was to explore the roles of hepatic FXR in triggering the immune response and the potential functions of FXR in regulating the lipid metabolism. In the present study, the full-length sequence of fxr from hybrid grouper was cloned and characterized for the first time. Upon the Vibrio parahaemolyticus stimulation, the transcriptional level of fxr was rapidly elevated in the head kidney tissue in the early stage of infection. In vivo and vitro, activation of FXR by obeticholic acid (OA) significantly increased the concentrations and mRNA levels of hepatic inflammatory cytokines. These effects were inversed when FXR was inhibited by guggulsterone (GU). Moreover, the activation of FXR to suppress the PI<sub>3</sub>K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway improves hepatic lipid metabolism and reduces hepatic lipid accumulation in vivo and vitro. In addition, the inhibition of FXR activated the PI<sub>3</sub>K/AKT/mTOR pathway, decreased the lipolysis and increased the lipogenesis, and subsequently increased the lipid accumulation in fish. These results revealed the positive roles of FXR in triggering immune responses and improving lipid metabolism and accumulation in hybrid grouper.",Xu J; Yao X; Li X; Xie S; Chi S; Zhang S; Cao J; Tan B,Fish physiology and biochemistry,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36210393/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Six iso-nitrogenous (50% crude protein) and iso-lipidic (10% crude lipid) diets were formulated; namely, a reference diet (FM) containing 50% FM and five experimental diets (4% (CM4), 8% (CM8), 12% (CM12), 16% (CM16), and 20% (CM20)) in which FM protein was substituted with CM at varying levels to feed fish (initial weight: 9.12 ± 0.01 g) for 8 weeks. The results showed that the final weight, weight gain rate, and specific growth rate were highest in the FM, CM4, and CM8 groups, whereas the feed conversion ratio, hepatosomatic and viscerosomatic indexes were significantly enhanced in the CM4 group in comparison to the others. The CM4 and CM12 groups were observed to show the highest intestinal length index values compared to the other groups, with the CM20 revealing the worst growth performance. The serum total protein content first increased (P < 0.05) in the CM4 group and decreased (P < 0.05) afterward. Nonetheless, a decreasing significant (P < 0.05) cholesterol and triglyceride contents were witnessed with the increasing replacement of FM with CM. Compared to the control group, a significant increase (P < 0.05) in the activities of serum and liver immunoglobulin-M, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, total antioxidant capacity, and complement-3 (except serum activity for CM12 group); liver lysozyme; intestinal amylase, and lipase, was witnessed in the CM groups. However, the serum lysozyme activity was highest (P < 0.05) in the CM4 group and lowest in the CM20 group. While the least serum malondialdehyde contents were observed in the CM4 group, that of the liver malondialdehyde was least witnessed in the FM, CM4, CM8, CM12, and CM16 groups as compared to the CM20. The intestinal histological examination revealed a significantly decreasing trend for villi height and villi width with increasing replacement levels. However, the muscle thickness, crypt depth, and type II mucus cells first increased upto 4% replacement level and later decreased. The increasing of dietary replacement levels significantly up-regulated pro-inflammatory (il-1β, tnf-α, myd88, ifn-γ, tlr-22, and il-12p40) and down-regulated anti-inflammatory (il-10, tgf-β, mhc-iiβ) and anti-bacterial peptide (epinecidin and hepcidin) mRNA levels in the intestine. The mRNA levels of il-6 was up-regulated firstly upto 4 and 8% replacement levels, and later down-regulated with increasing replacement. These results suggested that, although higher dietary CM replacement enhances the immune, antioxidant and digestive enzymes, it aggravates intestinal inflammation.

36183483,Possible metabolic interplay between quality of life and fecal microbiota in a presenior population: Preliminary results.,"The number of people aged ≥60 y is increasing worldwide, so establishing a relationship between lifestyle and health-associated factors, such as gut microbiota in an older population, is important. This study aimed to characterize the gut microbiota of a presenior population, and analyze the association between some bacteria and quality of life with the Short Form (SF) 36 questionnaire. Participants were adult men and women ages 50 to 80 y (n = 74). In addition to the SF-36 questionnaire, fecal samples were collected in cryotubes, and 16S RNA gene sequencing was performed to characterize microbial features. Participants were classified into two groups according to SF-36 punctuation. Linear and logistic regression models were performed to assess the possible association between any bacterial bowl and SF-36 score. Receiver operating characteristics curves were fitted to define the relative diagnostic strength of different bacterial taxa for the correct determination of quality of life. A positive relationship was established between SF-36 score and Actinobacteria (P = 0.0310; R = 0.2510) compared with Peptostreptococcaceae (P = 0.0259; R = -0.2589), which increased with decreasing quality of life. Logistic regressions models and receiver operating characteristics curves showed that the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Peptostreptococcaceae may be useful to predict quality of life in a presenior population (area under the curve: 0.71). Quality of life may be associated with the relative abundance of certain bacteria, especially Actinobacteria and Peptostreptococcaceae, which may have a specific effect on certain markers and health care, which is important to improve quality of life in older populations.",de Cuevillas B; Riezu-Boj JI; Abete I; Zulet MA; Galarregui C; Gonzalez-Navarro CJ; Milagro FI; Martínez JA; Navas-Carretero S,"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36183483/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36155019,Toxicity of chronic waterborne zinc exposure in the hepatopancreas of white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei.,"Zinc (Zn) is necessary for the survival of aquatic organisms; nevertheless, the accumulation of Zn in excessive amounts may have toxic consequences. Few studies focusing on the biochemical, morphological, and transcriptional effects of aqueous Zn in Litopenaeus vannamei have been reported, and the underlying toxic mechanism remains largely unknown. The present study was performed to investigate the growth performance, morphological alterations, physiological changes, and transcriptional responses after Zn exposure at 0 (control), 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/L concentrations for 30 days in white shrimp L. vannamei hepatopancreas. The results found that survival rate (SR) and growth performance were significantly reduced in 1 mg/L Zn group. Significant structural damage and significant Zn accumulation in hepatopancreas were observed. The activities of trypsin and amylase (AMS), and the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) were attenuated, while the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were significantly increased after Zn exposure. Many differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained after Zn exposure, and the majority of these DEGs were downregulated. Ten DEGs involved in oxidative stress, immunological response, apoptosis, and other processes were selected for qRT-PCR validation and the expression profiles of these DEGs kept well consistent with the transcriptome data, which confirmed the accuracy and reliability of the transcriptome results. Subsequently, we screened 12 genes to examine the changes of expression in different concentrations in more detail. All the results implying that Zn exposure caused severe histopathological changes and increased Zn accumulation in hepatopancreas, altered immune, antioxidant and detoxifying response by regulating the gene expressions of related genes, and eventually might trigger apoptosis. These findings provide valuable information and a new perspective on the molecular toxicity of crustaceans in response to environmental heavy metal exposure.",Liang Z; Chen T; Yang F; Li S; Zhang S; Guo H,Chemosphere,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36155019/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36151767,Effect of splenic transfer factor on the development of intestinal mucosal barrier in laying hens.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different doses of chicken spleen transfer factor (TF) on the structure of intestinal epithelial cells in different age groups. One-day-old White Leghorns laying hens were randomly divided into four groups: three groups were administered TF at different dosages (0.10, 0.25 or 1.00 mL) and a fourth group was set as control (administered saline, 1.00 mL). Using hematoxylin and eosin staining, high-throughput sequencing, microbiota analysis, quantitative polymerase reaction and western blotting. We measured the effects of different doses of TF on the following: intestinal mucosal epithelial tissue morphology, intestinal mucosal epithelial barrier-related gene expression profiles, and intestinal epithelial tight junction gene protein levels. The collected data show that TF can improve the absorption of nutrients by increasing villus height and crypt depth, and regulate intestinal flora disorders. Furthermore, we verified that the expression of the claudin and occludin tight junctions between intestinal epithelial cells was increased with TF. this research is very important for focusing on the structure and gene expression of intestinal tissues.

36125787,Precision Nutrition: Recent Advances in Obesity.,"""Precision nutrition"" is an emerging area of nutrition research that focuses on understanding metabolic variability within and between individuals and helps develop customized dietary plans and interventions to maintain optimal individual health. It encompasses nutritional genomic (gene-nutrient interactions), epigenetic, microbiome, and environmental factors. Obesity is a complex disease that is affected by genetic and environmental factors and thus a relevant target of precision nutrition-based approaches. Recent studies have shown significant associations between obesity phenotypes (body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, and central and regional adiposity) and genetic variants, epigenetic factors (DNA methylation and noncoding RNA), microbial species, and environment (sociodemographics and physical activity). Additionally, studies have also shown that the interactions between genetic variants, microbial metabolites, and epigenetic factors affect energy balance and adiposity. These include variants in <i>FTO, MC4R, PPAR</i>, <i>APOA</i>, and <i>FADS</i> genes, DNA methylation in CpG island regions, and specific miRNAs and microbial species such as <i>Firmicutes</i>, <i>Bacteriodes</i>, <i>Clostridiales,</i> etc. Similarly, studies have shown that microbial metabolites, folate, B-vitamins, and short-chain fatty acids interact with miRNAs to influence obesity phenotypes. With the advent of next-generation sequencing and analytical approaches, the advances in precision nutrition have the potential to lead to new paradigms, which can further lead to interventions or customized treatments specific to individuals or susceptible groups of individuals. This review highlights the recent advances in precision nutrition as applied to obesity and projects the importance of precision nutrition in obesity and weight management.",Voruganti VS,"Physiology (Bethesda, Md.)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36125787/,1,0,0,0,0,0

PN can help answer the question ""What should I eat to be healthy?"", recognizing that what is healthful for one individual may not be the same for another, and understanding that health and responses to diet change over time. The growth of the PN market has been driven by increasing consumer interest in individualized products and services coupled with advances in technology, analytics, and omic sciences. However, important concerns are evident regarding the adequacy of scientific substantiation supporting claims for current products and services. An additional limitation to accessing PN is the current cost of diagnostic tests and wearable devices. Despite these challenges, PN holds great promise as a tool to improve healthspan and reduce healthcare costs. Accelerating advancement in PN will require: (a) investment in multidisciplinary collaborations to enable the development of user-friendly tools applying technological advances in omics, sensors, artificial intelligence, big data management, and analytics; (b) engagement of healthcare professionals and payers to support equitable and broader adoption of PN as medicine shifts toward preventive and personalized approaches; and (c) system-wide collaboration between stakeholders to advocate for continued support for evidence-based PN, develop a regulatory framework to maintain consumer trust and engagement, and allow PN to reach its full potential.",Berciano S; Figueiredo J; Brisbois TD; Alford S; Koecher K; Eckhouse S; Ciati R; Kussmann M; Ordovas JM; Stebbins K; Blumberg JB,Frontiers in nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36118748/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36061898,Gut microbiota and host genetics modulate the effect of diverse diet patterns on metabolic health.,"Metabolic diseases are major public health issues worldwide and are responsible for disproportionately higher healthcare costs and increased complications of many diseases including SARS-CoV-2 infection. The Western Diet (WD) specifically is believed to be a major contributor to the global metabolic disease epidemic. In contrast, the Mediterranean diet (MeD), Ketogenic diet (KD), and Japanese diet (JD) are often considered beneficial for metabolic health. Yet, there is a growing appreciation that the effect of diet on metabolic health varies depending on several factors including host genetics. Additionally, poor metabolic health has also been attributed to altered gut microbial composition and/or function. To understand the complex relationship between host genetics, gut microbiota, and dietary patterns, we treated four widely used metabolically diverse inbred mouse strains (A/J, C57BL/6J, FVB/NJ, and NOD/ShiLtJ) with four human-relevant diets (MeD, JD, KD, WD), and a control mouse chow from 6 weeks to 30 weeks of age. We found that diet-induced alteration of gut microbiota (α-diversity, β-diversity, and abundance of several bacteria including <i>Bifidobacterium, Ruminococcus, Turicibacter, Faecalibaculum</i>, and <i>Akkermansia</i>) is significantly modified by host genetics. In addition, depending on the gut microbiota, the same diet could have different metabolic health effects. Our study also revealed that C57BL/6J mice are more susceptible to altered gut microbiota compared to other strains in this study indicating that host genetics is an important modulator of the diet-microbiota-metabolic health axis. Overall, our study demonstrated complex interactions between host genetics, gut microbiota, and diet on metabolic health; indicating the need to consider both host genetics and the gut microbiota in the development of new and more effective precision nutrition strategies to improve metabolic health.",Huda MN; Salvador AC; Barrington WT; Gacasan CA; D'Souza EM; Deus Ramirez L; Threadgill DW; Bennett BJ,Frontiers in nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36061898/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36055772,Research gaps and opportunities in precision nutrition: an NIH workshop report.,"Precision nutrition is an emerging concept that aims to develop nutrition recommendations tailored to different people's circumstances and biological characteristics. Responses to dietary change and the resulting health outcomes from consuming different diets may vary significantly between people based on interactions between their genetic backgrounds, physiology, microbiome, underlying health status, behaviors, social influences, and environmental exposures. On 11-12 January 2021, the National Institutes of Health convened a workshop entitled ""Precision Nutrition: Research Gaps and Opportunities"" to bring together experts to discuss the issues involved in better understanding and addressing precision nutrition. The workshop proceeded in 3 parts: part I covered many aspects of genetics and physiology that mediate the links between nutrient intake and health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer disease, and cancer; part II reviewed potential contributors to interindividual variability in dietary exposures and responses such as baseline nutritional status, circadian rhythm/sleep, environmental exposures, sensory properties of food, stress, inflammation, and the social determinants of health; part III presented the need for systems approaches, with new methods and technologies that can facilitate the study and implementation of precision nutrition, and workforce development needed to create a new generation of researchers. The workshop concluded that much research will be needed before more precise nutrition recommendations can be achieved. This includes better understanding and accounting for variables such as age, sex, ethnicity, medical history, genetics, and social and environmental factors. The advent of new methods and technologies and the availability of considerably more data bring tremendous opportunity. However, the field must proceed with appropriate levels of caution and make sure the factors listed above are all considered, and systems approaches and methods are incorporated.

36046837,Dopaminylation in Psychostimulant Use Disorder Protects Against Psychostimulant Seeking Behavior by Normalizing Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) Dopamine Expression.,"Repeated cocaine administration changes histone acetylation and methylation on Lys residues and Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) within the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Recently Nestler's group explored histone Arg (R) methylation in reward processing models. Damez-Werno <i>et al.</i> (2016) reported that during human investigations and animal self-administration experiments, the histone mark protein-R-methyltransferase-6 (PRMT6) and asymmetric dimethylation of R2 on histone H3 (H3R2me2a) decreased in the rodent and cocaine-dependent human NAc. Overexpression of PRMT6 in D2-MSNs in all NAc neurons increased cocaine seeking, whereas PRMT6 overexpression in D1-MSNs protects against cocaine-seeking. The hypothesis is that dopaminylation (H3R2me2a binding) occurs in psychostimulant use disorder (PSU), and the binding inhibitor Srcin1, like the major DRD2 A2 allelic polymorphism, protects against psychostimulant seeking behavior by normalizing nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopamine expression. Numerous publications confirmed the association between the DRD2 <b><i>Taq A1</i></b> allele (30-40 lower D2 receptor numbers) and severe cocaine dependence. Lepack <i>et al.</i> (2020) found that acute cocaine increases dopamine in NAc synapses, and results in histone H3 glutamine 5 dopaminylation (H3Q5dop) and consequent inhibition of D2 expression. The inhibition increases with chronic cocaine use and accompanies cocaine withdrawal. They also found that the Src kinase signaling inhibitor 1 (Srcin1 or p140CAP) during cocaine withdrawal reduced H3R2me2a binding. Consequently, this inhibited dopaminylation induced a ""homeostatic brake."" The decrease in Src signaling in NAc D2-MSNs, (like the DRD2 Taq A2 allele, a well-known genetic mechanism protective against SUD) normalizes the NAc dopamine expression and decreases cocaine reward and motivation to self-administer cocaine. The Srcin1 may be an important therapeutic target.",Blum K; Gold MS; Cadet JL; Baron D; Bowirrat A; Thanos PK; Brewer R; Badgaiyan RD; Gondré-Lewis MC,Current psychopharmacology,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36046837/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35995413,Optimization and evaluation of viral metagenomic amplification and sequencing procedures toward a genome-level resolution of the human fecal DNA virome.,"Viruses in the human gut have been linked to health and disease. Deciphering the gut virome is dependent on metagenomic sequencing of the virus-like particles (VLPs) purified from the fecal specimens. A major limitation of conventional viral metagenomic sequencing is the low recoverability of viral genomes from the metagenomic dataset. To develop an optimal method for viral amplification and metagenomic sequencing for maximizing the recovery of viral genomes. We performed parallel virus enrichment and DNA extraction to generate ∼ 30 viral DNA samples from each of 5 fresh fecal specimens and conducted the experiments including 1) optimizing the cycle number for high-fidelity enzyme-based PCR amplification, 2) evaluating the reproducibility of the optimally whole viral metagenomic experimental process, 3) evaluating the reliability of multiple displacement amplification (MDA), 4) testing the capability of long-read sequencing for improving viral metagenomic assembly, and 5) comparing the differences between viral metagenomic and bulk metagenomic approaches. Our results revealed that the optimal cycle number for PCR amplification is 15. We verified the reliability of MDA and the effectiveness of long-read sequencing. Based on our optimized results, we generated 151 high-quality viruses using the dataset combined from short-read and long-read sequencing. Genomic analysis of these viruses found that most (60.3%) of them were previously unknown and showed a remarkable diversity of viral functions, especially the existence of 206 viral auxiliary metabolic genes. Finally, we uncovered significant differences in the efficiency and coverage of viral identification between viral metagenomic and bulk metagenomic approaches. Our study demonstrates the potential of optimized experiment and sequencing strategies in uncovering viral genomes from fecal specimens, which will facilitate future research about the genome-level characterization of complex viral communities.",Wang G; Li S; Yan Q; Guo R; Zhang Y; Chen F; Tian X; Lv Q; Jin H; Ma X; Ma Y,Journal of advanced research,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35995413/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35983694,Diallyl Trisulfide Prevents Adipogenesis and Lipogenesis by Regulating the Transcriptional Activation Function of KLF15 on PPARγ to Ameliorate Obesity.,"Diallyl trisulfide (DATS) is a bioactive compound in garlic. The anti-obesity effect of garlic oil has been reported, but the role and mechanism of DATS in preventing obesity remain to be explored. Studies with high-fat-diet-induced obese mice and 3T3-L1 adipocytes are performed. The results show that DATS significantly reduces lipid accumulation and repairs disordered metabolism in vivo by restraining adipogenesis and lipogenesis, and promoting lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation in white adipose tissue. In cells, DATS plays different roles at different stages of adipocyte differentiation. Notably, DATS reduces lipid accumulation mainly by inhibiting adipogenesis and lipogenesis at the late stage. KLF15 is knocked down in 3T3-L1 cells, which eliminate the inhibitory effect of DATS on adipogenesis and lipogenesis. The dual-luciferase reporter and ChIP assays indicate that DATS can inhibit the transcriptional activation function of KLF15 on PPARγ by inhibiting the binding of KLF15 to PPARγ promoter. The function comparison of structural analogs and the intervention of dithiothreitol show that disulfide bond is crucial for DATS to work.

35964923,Common and ethnic-specific genetic determinants of hemoglobin concentration between Taiwanese Han Chinese and European Whites: findings from comparative two-stage genome-wide association studies.,"Human iron nutrition is a result of interplays between genetic and environmental factors. However, there has been scarcity of data on the genetic variants associated with altered iron homeostasis and ethnic-specific associations are further lacking. In this study, we compared between the Taiwanese Han Chinese (HC) and European Whites the genetic determinants of hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, a biochemical parameter that in part reflects the amount of functional iron in the body. Through sex-specific two-stage genome-wide association studies (2S-GWAS), we observed the consistent Hb-association of SNPs in TMPRSS6 (chr 22), ABO (chr 9), and PRKCE (chr 2) across sexes in both ethnic groups. Specific to the Taiwanese HC, the Hb-association of AXIN1, together with other loci near the chr 16 alpha-globin gene cluster, was found novel. On the other hand, majority of the Hb-associated SNPs among Europeans were identified along the chr 6 major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, which has established roles in immune system control. We report here strong Hb-associations of HFE and members of gene families (SLC17; H2A, H2B, H3, H4, H1; TRIM; ZSCAN, ZKSCAN, ZNF; HLA; BTN, OR), numerous SNPs in/nearby CARMIL1, PRRC2A, PSORS1C1, NOTCH4, TSBP1, C6orf15, and distinct associations with non-coding RNA genes. Our findings provide evidence for both common and ethnic-specific genetic determinants of Hb between East Asians and Caucasians. These will help to further our understanding of the iron and/or erythropoiesis physiology in humans and to identify high risk subgroups for iron imbalances - a primary requirement to meet the goal of precision nutrition for optimal health.",Timoteo VJ; Chiang KM; Yang HC; Pan WH,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35964923/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35956399,Association of Polygenic Variants with Type 2 Diabetes Risk and Their Interaction with Lifestyles in Asians.,"Over the last several decades, there has been a considerable growth in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in Asians. A pathophysiological mechanism in Asian T2DM is closely linked to low insulin secretion, β-cell mass, and inability to compensate for insulin resistance. We hypothesized that genetic variants associated with lower β-cell mass and function and their combination with unhealthy lifestyle factors significantly raise T2DM risk among Asians. This hypothesis was explored with participants aged over 40. Participants were categorized into T2DM (case; n = 5383) and control (n = 53,318) groups. The genetic variants associated with a higher risk of T2DM were selected from a genome-wide association study in a city hospital-based cohort, and they were confirmed with a replicate study in Ansan/Ansung plus rural cohorts. The interacted genetic variants were identified with generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis, and the polygenic risk score (PRS)-nutrient interactions were examined. The 8-SNP model was positively associated with T2DM risk by about 10 times, exhibiting a higher association than the 20-SNP model, including all T2DM-linked SNPs with p < 5 × 10−6. The SNPs in the models were primarily involved in pancreatic β-cell growth and survival. The PRS of the 8-SNP model interacted with three lifestyle factors: energy intake based on the estimated energy requirement (EER), Western-style diet (WSD), and smoking status. Fasting serum glucose concentrations were much higher in the participants with High-PRS in rather low EER intake and high-WSD compared to the High-EER and Low-WSD, respectively. They were shown to be higher in the participants with High-PRS in smokers than in non-smokers. In conclusion, the genetic impact of T2DM risk was mainly involved with regulating pancreatic β-cell mass and function, and the PRS interacted with lifestyles. These results highlight the interaction between genetic impacts and lifestyles in precision nutrition.",Hur HJ; Yang HJ; Kim MJ; Lee KH; Kim MS; Park S,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35956399/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35956351,Glycochenodeoxycholate Affects Iron Homeostasis via Up-Regulating Hepcidin Expression.,"Increasing hepcidin expression is a vital factor in iron homeostasis imbalance among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent studies have elucidated that abnormal serum steroid levels might cause the elevation of hepcidin. Glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDCA), a steroid, is significantly elevated in patients with CKD. However, the correlation between GCDCA and hepcidin has not been elucidated. Decreased serum iron levels and increased hepcidin levels were both detected in patients with CKD in this study. Additionally, the concentrations of GCDCA in nephropathy patients were found to be higher than those in healthy subjects. HepG2 cells were used to investigate the effect of GCDCA on hepcidin in vitro. The results showed that hepcidin expression increased by nearly two-fold against control under 200 μM GCDCA treatment. The phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8 increased remarkably, while STAT3 and CREBH remained unchanged. GCDCA triggered the expression of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), followed with the transcription and expression of both BMP6 and ALK3 (upward regulators of SMAD1/5/8). Thus, GCDCA is a potential regulator for hepcidin, which possibly acts by triggering FXR and the BMP6/ALK3-SMAD signaling pathway. Furthermore, 40 C57/BL6 mice were treated with 100 mg/kg/d, 200 mg/kg/d, and 300 mg/kg/d GCDCA to investigate its effect on hepcidin in vivo. The serum level of hepcidin increased in mice treated with 200 mg/kg/d and 300 mg/kg/d GCDCA, while hemoglobin and serum iron levels decreased. Similarly, the FXR-mediated SMAD signaling pathway was also responsible for activating hepcidin in liver. Overall, it was concluded that GCDCA could induce the expression of hepcidin and reduce serum iron level, in which FXR activation-related SMAD signaling was the main target for GCDCA. Thus, abnormal GCDCA level indicates a potential risk of iron homeostasis imbalance.",Wang LJ; Zhao GP; Wang XF; Liu XX; Li YX; Qiu LL; Wang XY; Ren FZ,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35956351/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35948824,Appraisal of Gene-Environment Interactions in GWAS for Evidence-Based Precision Nutrition Implementation.,"This review aims to analyse the currently reported gene-environment (G × E) interactions in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), involving environmental factors such as lifestyle and dietary habits related to metabolic syndrome phenotypes. For this purpose, the present manuscript reviews the available GWAS registered on the GWAS Catalog reporting the interaction between environmental factors and metabolic syndrome traits. Advances in omics-related analytical and computational approaches in recent years have led to a better understanding of the biological processes underlying these G × E interactions. A total of 42 GWAS were analysed, reporting over 300 loci interacting with environmental factors. Alcohol consumption, sleep time, smoking habit and physical activity were the most studied environmental factors with significant G × E interactions. The implementation of more comprehensive GWAS will provide a better understanding of the metabolic processes that determine individual responses to environmental exposures and their association with the development of chronic diseases such as obesity and the metabolic syndrome. This will facilitate the development of precision approaches for better prevention, management and treatment of these diseases.",San-Cristobal R; de Toro-Martín J; Vohl MC,Current nutrition reports,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35948824/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35945490,Altered macronutrient composition and genetics influence the complex transcriptional network associated with adiposity in the Collaborative Cross.,"Obesity is a serious disease with a complex etiology characterized by overaccumulation of adiposity resulting in detrimental health outcomes. Given the liver's critical role in the biological processes that attenuate adiposity accumulation, elucidating the influence of genetics and dietary patterns on hepatic gene expression is fundamental for improving methods of obesity prevention and treatment. To determine how genetics and diet impact obesity development, mice from 22 strains of the genetically diverse recombinant inbred Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse panel were challenged to either a high-protein or high-fat high-sucrose diet, followed by extensive phenotyping and analysis of hepatic gene expression. Over 1000 genes differentially expressed by perturbed dietary macronutrient composition were enriched for biological processes related to metabolic pathways. Additionally, over 9000 genes were differentially expressed by strain and enriched for biological process involved in cell adhesion and signaling. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified multiple gene clusters (modules) associated with body fat % whose average expression levels were influenced by both dietary macronutrient composition and genetics. Each module was enriched for distinct types of biological functions. Genetic background affected hepatic gene expression in the CC overall, but diet macronutrient differences also altered expression of a specific subset of genes. Changes in macronutrient composition altered gene expression related to metabolic processes, while genetic background heavily influenced a broad range of cellular functions and processes irrespective of adiposity. Understanding the individual role of macronutrient composition, genetics, and their interaction is critical to developing therapeutic strategies and policy recommendations for precision nutrition.",Yam P; VerHague M; Albright J; Gertz E; Pardo-Manuel de Villena F; Bennett BJ,Genes & nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35945490/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35903357,Landscape of Variability in Chemosensory Genes Associated With Dietary Preferences in Indian Population: Analysis of 1029 Indian Genomes.,"Perception and preferences for food and beverages determine dietary behaviour and health outcomes. Inherent differences in chemosensory genes, ethnicity, geo-climatic conditions, and sociocultural practices are other determinants. We aimed to study the variation landscape of chemosensory genes involved in perception of taste, texture, odour, temperature and burning sensations through analysis of 1,029 genomes of the IndiGen project and diverse continental populations. SNPs from 80 chemosensory genes were studied in whole genomes of 1,029 IndiGen samples and 2054 from the 1000 Genomes project. Population genetics approaches were used to infer ancestry of IndiGen individuals, gene divergence and extent of differentiation among studied populations. 137,760 SNPs including common and rare variants were identified in IndiGenomes with 62,950 novel (46%) and 48% shared with the 1,000 Genomes. Genes associated with olfaction harbored most SNPs followed by those associated with differences in perception of salt and pungent tastes. Across species, receptors for bitter taste were the most diverse compared to others. Three predominant ancestry groups within IndiGen were identified based on population structure analysis. We also identified 1,184 variants that exhibit differences in frequency of derived alleles and high population differentiation (F<sub>ST</sub> ≥0.3) in Indian populations compared to European, East Asian and African populations. Examples include <i>ADCY10</i>, <i>TRPV1</i>, <i>RGS6</i>, <i>OR7D4</i>, <i>ITPR3</i>, <i>OPRM1</i>, <i>TCF7L2</i>, and <i>RUNX1</i>.

35881882,Metabolomics-Guided Comparison of Pollen and Microalgae-Based Artificial Diets in Honey Bees.,"Managed honey bee colonies used for crop pollination are fed artificial diets to offset nutritional deficiencies related to land-use intensification and climate change. In this study, we formulated novel microalgae diets using <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i> and <i>Arthrospira platensis</i> (spirulina) biomass and fed them to young adult honey bee workers. Diet-induced changes in bee metabolite profiles were studied relative to a natural pollen diet using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomics. Untargeted analyses of pollen- and microalgae-fed bees revealed significant overlap, with 248 shared features determined by LC-MS and 87 shared features determined by GC-MS. Further metabolomic commonalities were evident upon subtraction of unique diet features. Twenty-five identified metabolites were influenced by diet, which included complex lipids, essential fatty acids, vitamins, and phytochemicals. The metabolomics results are useful to understand mechanisms underlying favorable growth performance as well as increased antioxidant and heat shock protein gene expression in bees fed the microalgae diets. We conclude that the tested microalgae have potential as sustainable feed additives and as a source of bee health-modulating natural products. Metabolomics-guided diet development could eventually help tailor feed interventions to achieve precision nutrition in honey bees and other livestock animals.",Ricigliano VA; Cank KB; Todd DA; Knowles SL; Oberlies NH,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35881882/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35872336,"Effects of dietary chenodeoxycholic acid supplementation in a low fishmeal diet on growth performance, lipid metabolism, autophagy and intestinal health of Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei.","An 8-week feeding trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) on growth performance, body composition, lipid metabolism, and intestinal health of juvenile white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei fed a low fishmeal diet. Four practical diets were formulated: HFM (25% fishmeal), LFM (15% fishmeal), LB1 (LFM + 0.04% CDCA), LB2 (LFM + 0.08% CDCA). Each diet was assigned to four tanks with forty shrimp (initial weight 0.33 ± 0.03 g) per tank. The results indicated that the growth performance of shrimp were similar between the four groups; the crude lipid content of shrimp fed the LB2 diet was significantly lower than those fed the HFM diet (P < 0.05). The lipase activity content in hepatopancreatic were significantly higher in the two CDCA supplemented groups than that in LFM group; the contents of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in hemolymph were significantly lower in LFM group, LB1 group and LB2 group than that in HFM group (P < 0.05). The shrimp fed LB1 diet was significantly decreased the intestinal expression levels of tube than those fed in HFM diet; the intestinal gene expression of imd and toll were significantly lower in LB2 group than those in HFM group (P < 0.05). The results of hepatopancreas gene expression suggest that shrimp fed the LFM diet showed significantly upregulated expression levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (srebp), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (acc), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (cpt-1) than those fed the HFM diet; shrimp fed the LB1 diet showed significantly upregulated expression levels of srebp, acc, and AMP-activated protein kinase (ampk) than those fed the HFM diet; shrimp fed the LB2 diet had higher expression levels of srebp, acc, and cpt-1 than those fed the HFM diet (P < 0.05). In the hepatopancreas, the shrimp fed the LFM diet shown significantly up-regulated the expression levels of beclin1 compared to those fed HFM diet; the expression levels of autophagy-related protein13 (atg3), autophagy-related protein 12 (atg12) of in shrimp fed the LB1 diet were significantly higher than those fed the HFM diet; and the expression levels of autophagy-related protein13 (atg13), beclin1, atg3, atg12, autophagy-related protein 9 (atg9) of shrimp fed LB2 diet were significantly higher than those fed the HFM diet (P < 0.05). The atg3 in intestine of shrimp fed the LB2 diet were significantly higher than those fed the HFM diet (P < 0.05). Intestinal mucous fold were damaged, hepatic tubules were disorganized and B cells appeared to be swollen in LFM group. The fold height and width of shrimp fed the diets supplemented with CDCA increased significantly than those fed the LFM diet (P < 0.05), the hepatic tubules were neatly arranged, and R cells increased. In conclusion, supplementary CDCA in a low fishmeal diet promoted lipid metabolism, enhanced autophagy of shrimp, also improved the health of the intestine and hepatopancreas.",Li X; Yao X; Zhang X; Dong X; Chi S; Tan B; Zhang S; Xie S,Fish & shellfish immunology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35872336/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35869285,"Mitochondrial RNA methyltransferase TRMT61B is a new, potential biomarker and therapeutic target for highly aneuploid cancers.","Despite being frequently observed in cancer cells, chromosomal instability (CIN) and its immediate consequence, aneuploidy, trigger adverse effects on cellular homeostasis that need to be overcome by anti-stress mechanisms. As such, these safeguard responses represent a tumor-specific Achilles heel, since CIN and aneuploidy are rarely observed in normal cells. Recent data have revealed that epitranscriptomic marks catalyzed by RNA-modifying enzymes change under various stress insults. However, whether aneuploidy is associated with such RNA modifying pathways remains to be determined. Through an in silico search for aneuploidy biomarkers in cancer cells, we found TRMT61B, a mitochondrial RNA methyltransferase enzyme, to be associated with high levels of aneuploidy. Accordingly, TRMT61B protein levels are increased in tumor cell lines with an imbalanced karyotype as well as in different tumor types when compared to control tissues. Interestingly, while TRMT61B depletion induces senescence in melanoma cell lines with low levels of aneuploidy, it leads to apoptosis in cells with high levels. The therapeutic potential of these results was further validated by targeting TRMT61B in transwell and xenografts assays. We show that TRM61B depletion reduces the expression of several mitochondrial encoded proteins and limits mitochondrial function. Taken together, these results identify a new biomarker of aneuploidy in cancer cells that could potentially be used to selectively target highly aneuploid tumors.",Martín A; Epifano C; Vilaplana-Marti B; Hernández I; Macías RIR; Martínez-Ramírez Á; Cerezo A; Cabezas-Sainz P; Garranzo-Asensio M; Amarilla-Quintana S; Gómez-Domínguez D; Caleiras E; Camps J; Gómez-López G; Gómez de Cedrón M; Ramírez de Molina A; Barderas R; Sánchez L; Velasco-Miguel S; Pérez de Castro I,Cell death and differentiation,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35869285/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35840201,"Insights into the bacterial, fungal, and phage communities and volatile profiles in different types of Daqu.","Daqu has a rich and diverse microbiota, giving them a suitable biotope for phages. However, the absolute abundances of bacteria and fungi, as well as the phage community characteristics in Daqu, remain unclear. In this study, the microbiota absolute abundance, indigenous phage composition and function, and volatile compound profiles of high-temperature Daqu (HTDQ), medium-temperature Daqu (MTDQ), and low-temperature Daqu (LTDQ) were investigated. Absolute microbiota quantification revealed that there were significant variations in microbial composition and absolute abundance across three types of Daqu. The absolute abundances of the top 30 bacterial genera in LTDQ, MTDQ, and HTDQ were 6.0 × 10<sup>5</sup>, 5.3 × 10<sup>4</sup>, 1.4 × 10<sup>5</sup> copies/ng DNA, while the top 30 fungal genera had 8.5 × 10<sup>7</sup>, 2.1 × 10<sup>6</sup>, and 6.2 × 10<sup>5</sup> copies/ng DNA, respectively. LTDQ were enriched in Pantoea, Staphylococcus, and Saccharomycopsis; MTDQ were dominated by Saccharopolyspora, Staphylococcus, Saccharomycopsis, and Aspergillus; HTDQ were dominated by Saccharopolyspora, Bacillus, Byssochlamys, and Saccharomycopsis. Volatile profile analysis revealed that LTDQ, MTDQ, and HTDQ comprised 68, 68, and 75 compounds, respectively, with 39 compounds shared by the three types. Fourteen volatile compounds were identified as highly discriminative features among three types of Daqu, which were closely related to Saccharopolyspora, Thermoactinomyces, Kroppenstedtia, Byssochlamys, and Thermomyces. Metaviromics indicated that Genomoviridae, Mimiviridae and Siphoviridae, and Parvoviridae were the dominant viruses in LTDQ, MTDQ, and HTDQ, respectively. The hosts of phages in Daqu mainly included Lactobacillus, Enterobacter, Pantoea, Bacillus, Pediococcus, and Staphylococcus. Phages may prey on numerous microbes living on Daqu via pathways such as genetic information processing, signaling and cellular processes, and replication and repair. This study highlights the use of absolute quantification to avoid misjudgment of differential taxa in comparative microbiome analysis and provides new insights into the phage community and function in Daqu.",Kang J; Chen X; Han BZ; Xue Y,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35840201/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Knowing the mechanisms that regulate its concentration can facilitate the development of Lp(a)-lowering drugs. This study analyzes the relationship between triglycerides (TGs) and Lp(a) concentrations, cross-sectionally and longitudinally, and the influence of the number and composition of TG-rich lipoproteins, and the APOE genotype. Data from Aragon Workers Health Study (AWHS) (n = 5467), National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III phase 2 (n = 3860), and Hospital Universitario Miguel Servet (HUMS) (n = 2079) were used for cross-sectional TG and Lp(a) relationship. Lp(a) intrasubject variation was studied in AWHS participants and HUMS patients with repeated measurements. TG-rich lipoproteins were quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance in a subsample from AWHS. Apolipoproteins B and E were quantified by Luminex in very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) isolated by ultracentrifugation, from HUMS samples. APOE genotyping was carried in AWHS and HUMS participants. Regression models adjusted for age and sex were used to study the association. The 3 studies showed an inverse relationship between TG and Lp(a). Increased VLDL number, size, and TG content were associated with significantly lower Lp(a). There was an inverse association between the apoE concentration in VLDL and Lp(a). No significant association was observed for apolipoprotein (apo)B. Subjects carrying the apoE2/E2 genotype had significantly lower levels of Lp(a). Our results show an inverse relationship Lp(a)-TG. Subjects with larger VLDL size have lower Lp(a), and lower values of Lp(a) were present in patients with apoE-rich VLDL and apoE2/E2 subjects. Our results suggest that bigger VLDLs and VLDLs enriched in apoE are inversely involved in Lp(a) plasma concentration.",Ramos-Cáceres M; Lamiquiz-Moneo I; Cenarro A; Calmarza P; Marco-Benedí V; Bea AM; Mateo-Gallego R; Puzo J; Ordovas JM; Civeira F; Laclaustra M,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35789387/,0,0,0,0,0,1

Recent investigations suggest that the abundance and diversity of the gut microbiome may also modify the dietary effects; however, considerable instability in the results from the microbiome research has been noted. In addition, growing studies suggest that a complicated multiomics algorithm would be developed by incorporating the genome, epigenome, metabolome, proteome, and microbiome in predicting the individual variability in response to diets. Moreover, precision nutrition would also scrutinize the role of biological (circadian) rhythm in determining the individual variability of dietary effects.

35777110,A weight-loss model based on baseline microbiota and genetic scores for selection of dietary treatments in overweight and obese population.,"The response to weight loss depends on the interindividual variability of determinants such as gut microbiota and genetics. The aim of this investigation was to develop an integrative model using microbiota and genetic information to prescribe the most suitable diet for a successful weight loss in individuals with excess of body weight. A total of 190 Spanish overweight and obese participants were randomly assigned to two hypocaloric diets for 4 months: 61 women and 29 men followed a moderately high protein (MHP) diet, and 72 women and 28 men followed a low fat (LF) diet. Baseline fecal DNA was sequenced and used for the construction of four microbiota subscores associated with the percentage of BMI loss for each diet (MHP and LF) and for each sex. Bootstrapping techniques and multiple linear regression models were used for the selection of families, genera and species included in the subscores. Finally, two total microbiota scores were generated for each sex. Two genetic subscores previously reported to weight loss were used to generate a total genetic score. In an attempt to personalize the weight loss prescription, several linear mixed models that included interaction with diet between microbiota scores and genetic scores for both, men and women, were studied. The microbiota subscore for the women who followed the MHP-diet included Coprococcus, Dorea, Flavonifractor, Ruminococcus albus and Clostridium bolteaea. For LF-diet women, Cytophagaceae, Catabacteriaceae, Flammeovirgaceae, Rhodobacteriaceae, Clostridium-x1vb, Bacteriodes nordiiay, Alistipes senegalensis, Blautia wexlerae and Psedoflavonifractor phocaeensis. For MHP-diet men, Cytophagaceae, Acidaminococcaceae, Marinilabiliaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Fusicatenibacter, Odoribacter and Ruminococcus faecis; and for LF-men, Porphyromanadaceae, Intestinimonas, Bacteroides finegoldii and Clostridium bartlettii. The mixed models with microbiota scores facilitated the selection of diet in 72% of women and in 84% of men. The model including genetic information allows to select the type of diet in 84% and 73%, respectively.

This is a nested, case-control study drawn from the China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial among rural Chinese adults with hypertension, including 557 first stroke cases and 557 age-matched, sex-matched, treatment group-matched, and residence-matched controls. Serum L-carnitine was measured by liquid chromatography with tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry. Multiple conditional logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between L-carnitine and first stroke. The mean level of serum L-carnitine in the stroke population was 4.7 μg/mL, which was significantly lower than that of the control group (5.7 μg/mL). When L-carnitine was assessed as quintiles, compared with the reference group (quintile 1, <3.3 μg/mL), the odds of stroke were 0.62 (95% CI, 0.39-1.00) in quintile 2, 0.66 (95% CI, 0.40-1.10) in quintile 3, 0.47 (95% CI, 0.28-0.81) in quintile 4, and 0.50 (95% CI, 0.30-0.84) in quintile 5. The trend test was significant (<i>P</i>=0.01). When quintiles 2 to 5 were combined, the adjusted odds ratio of first stroke was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.38-0.87) compared with quintile 1. Similar associations were found for ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. In subgroup analysis, a significant L-carnitine-stroke association was only observed in the normal folate group (<i>P</i> interaction, 0.039) and in the <i>MTHFR</i> CC genotype group (<i>P</i> interaction, 0.047).

35631221,Association between Vitamin Intake and Chronic Kidney Disease According to a Variant Located Upstream of the <i>PTGS1</i> Gene: A Cross-Sectional Analysis of Shika Study.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients have been advised to take vitamins; however, the effects have been controversial. The individual differences in developing CKD might involve genetic variants of inflammation, including variant rs883484 located upstream of the prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1 (PTGS1) gene. We aimed to identify whether the 12 dietary vitamin intake interacts with genotypes of the rs883484 on developing CKD. The population-based, cross-sectional study had 684 Japanese participants (≥40 years old). The study used a validated, brief, self-administered diet history questionnaire to estimate the intake of the dietary vitamins. CKD was defined as estimated glomerular filtration < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. The study participants had an average age of 62.1 ± 10.8 years with 15.4% minor homozygotes of rs883484, and 114 subjects had CKD. In the fully adjusted model, the higher intake of vitamins, namely niacin (odds ratio (OR) = 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.57−0.96, p = 0.024), α-tocopherol (OR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.26−0.95, p = 0.034), and vitamin C (OR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95−1.00, p = 0.037), was independently associated with lower CKD tendency in the minor homozygotes of rs883484.

35618172,"Effects of the Clostridium butyricum on growth performance, antioxidant capacity, immunity and disease resistance of Litopenaeus Vannamei fed with cottonseed protein concentrate (CPC) replacement of fishmeal in diet.","Clostridium butyricum (CB) is a gram-positive bacterium that secretes short-chain fatty acids such as butyric acid and so on. An 8-week feeding trial was conducted to investigate the effects of CB on the growth performance, antioxidant capacity, immunity and resistance to Vibrio parahaemolyticus in Litopenaeus Vannamei fed with cottonseed protein concentrate (CPC) replacement of fishmeal. Six iso-nitrogenous (40%) and iso-lipidic (6%) diets were formulated including a positive control group (PC, 25% fishmeal), a negative control group (NC, CPC replaced 30% of fishmeal protein), and 0.03% (C1, 3 × 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/kg), 0.12% (C2, 1.2 × 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/kg), 0.48% (C3, 4.8 × 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/kg) and 1.92% (C4, 1.92 × 10<sup>10</sup> CFU/kg) CB were supplemented on the negative control group (NC). After the feeding trial, the remaining shrimp in each treatment group were subjected to a challenge experiment with Vibrio parahaemolyticus. The results indicated that weight gain rate (WGR), specific growth rate (SGR) in C4 group were significantly lower than those in PC and C2 groups (P < 0.05); the feed conversion ratio (FCR) was significantly higher than that of PC and C2 groups (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in survival rate (SR) among all groups (P > 0.05). Compared to the PC and NC groups, the total superoxide capacity, superoxide dismutase and lysozyme were significantly higher in the C4 group (P < 0.05); the glutathione peroxidase, acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase were significantly higher in the C3 group (P < 0.05); and the malondialdehyde was significantly lower in the C4 group (P < 0.05). The relative mRNA expressions of Toll receptor (TLR), innate immune deficiency gene (IMD), penaiedin3a (Pen3) were significantly down-regulated in the NC group than those in the PC group (P < 0.05). In addition, the relative mRNA expressions of TLR, IMD and Pen3 were significantly up-regulated in all groups supplemented with CB than those in the NC group (P < 0.05). Moreover, the cumulative mortality rate in the NC group was not significantly different from the PC group (P > 0.05) and was significantly higher than those in the C3 and C4 groups (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the CB supplementation on the basis of CPC replacement of 30% fishmeal protein enhanced significantly the antioxidant capacity, immunity and disease resistance of shrimp and improved its growth performance. Therefore, considering the factors of the growth, immunity and disease resistance, the CB supplementation of 0.12%-0.48% (1.2 × 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/kg-4.8 × 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/kg) was recommended in the diet of L. vannamei based on the results of this experiment.",Li W; Pan L; Liu H; Tan B; Dong X; Yang Q; Chi S; Zhang S; Xie R,Fish & shellfish immunology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35618172/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35616722,Sandwich capture ultrasensitive sensor based on biohybrid interface for the detection of Cronobacter sakazakii.,"A simple, rapid and ultrasensitive visual sensing method for the detection of Cronobacter sakazakii (C. sakazakii) based on a biohybrid interface was established. During the entire sensing process, quadruple-cascade amplification showed its superior sensing performance. First, the prepared immunomagnetic beads (IMB) were used to isolate and enrich specific targets from the food matrix. After adding the fusion aptamer, the aptamer sequence specifically recognized the target and formed the immune sandwich structure of antibody-target-fusion aptamer. In addition, the fusion aptamer also included the template sequence of exponential amplification reaction (EXPAR), which contained the antisense sequence of the G-rich sequence. Therefore, a large number of G-rich sequences can be generated after EXPAR can be triggered in the presence of Bst. DNA polymerase, nicking endonuclease, cDNA, and dNTP. They were self-assembled into G-quadruplex structures and then combined with hemin to form G4/hemin DNAzyme, resulting in visible coloration and measuring absorbance at 450 nm for quantitative detection. The assay showed a limit of detection (LOD) of 2 CFU/mL in pure culture and 12 CFU/g in milk powder in optimal conditions. This method provides a promising strategy for rapid and point-of-care testing (POCT) since it does not require DNA extraction, medium culturing, and expensive instrumentation.

35616067,The interaction between Alternative Healthy Eating Index and MC4R rs17782313 gene variants on central and general obesity indices in women: A cross-sectional study.,"Previous studies have shown that the C allele of melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) rs17782313 and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) are separately associated with obesity. However, the present study aimed to investigate the interaction between MC4R rs17782313 variants and the AHEI and their association with central and general obesity indices, which has not been assessed previously. In total, 291 women with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg m<sup>-2</sup> and aged 18-48 years enrolled in this cross-sectional study. All participants were assessed for body composition, anthropometric measures, dietary intake, and blood parameters. After obtaining data of dietary intake from the 147-item food frequency questionnaire, the AHEI was calculated. MC4R rs17782313 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were assessed using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction length polymorphism method. After adjustment for age, energy intake, physical activity, marital status, and economic status, the interaction between MC4R rs17782313 and the AHEI was associated with hip circumference [β = -0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.77 to -0.05, p = 0.02], BMI (β = -0.15, 95% CI = -0.29 to -0.02, p = 0.02), fat mass (kg) (β = -0.28, 95% CI = -0.56 to -0.01, p = 0.03), visceral fat area (β = -5.68, 95% CI = -9.55 to -1.80, p = 0.004). The other measures that appear to be suggestively related to this interaction (0.05 < p < 0.07) are waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio, trunk fat (%), trunk fat (kg), fat mass (%) and fat mass index. The interaction between MC4R rs17782313 and the AHEI can be related to central and general obesity indices in overweight/obese women.",Zarei M; Shiraseb F; Mirzababaei A; Mirzaei K,Journal of human nutrition and dietetics : the official journal of the British Dietetic Association,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35616067/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35593923,Precision nutrition in diabetes: when population-based dietary advice gets personal.,"Diet plays a fundamental role in maintaining long-term health, with healthful diets being endorsed by current dietary guidelines for the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. However, the response to dietary interventions varies widely, highlighting the need for refinement and personalisation beyond population-based 'one size fits all'. This article reviews the clinical evidence supporting precision nutrition as a fundamental approach for dietary advice in diabetes. Further, it proposes a framework for the eventual implementation of precision nutrition and discusses key challenges for the application of this approach in the prevention of diabetes. One implication of this approach is that precision nutrition would not exclude the parallel goal of population-based healthy dietary advice. Nevertheless, the shift in prioritising precision nutrition is needed to reflect the dynamic nature of responses to dietary interventions that vary among individuals and change over the life course.",Merino J,Diabetologia,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35593923/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35577318,"The positive effects of dietary inositol on juvenile hybrid grouper (♀ Epinephelus fuscoguttatus × ♂ E. lanceolatu) fed high-lipid diets: Growthperformance, antioxidant capacity and immunity.","The objective of the present research was to assess the influence of inositol supplementation on growth performance, histological morphology of liver, immunity and expression of immune-related genes in juvenile hybrid grouper (♀ Epinephelus fuscoguttatus × ♂ E. lanceolatu). Hybrid grouper (initial weight 6.76 ± 0.34 g) were fed isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets (16%) with various inositol levels of 0.17 g/kg (J1, the control group), 0.62 g/kg (J2), 1.03 g/kg (J3), 1.78 g/kg (J4), 3.43 g/kg (J5), 6.59 g/kg (J6), respectively. The growth experiment lasted for 8 weeks. The results indicated that dietary inositol had a significant promoting effect on final mean body weight of the J5 and J6 groups and specific growth rate (SGR) of the J3, J4, J5 and J6 groups (P < 0.05). In the serum, superoxide dismutase (SOD) of the J4 group became significantly active compared with that of the control group (P < 0.05), while aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activities in the inositol-treated groups showed distinctly decreased compared with those of the control group (P < 0.05). In the liver, dietary inositol could significantly increase the activities of SOD, catalase (CAT), lysozyme (LYZ) and the contents of total antioxidative capacity (T-AOC) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) (P < 0.05), and distinctly reduce the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, the damaged histological morphology of the liver was relieved and even returned to normal after an inositol increase (0.4-3.2 g/kg). In the liver, the remarkable up-regulation of SOD, CAT, glutathione peroxidase (GPX), heat shock protein70 (HSP70) and heat shock protein90 (HSP90) expression levels were stimulated by supply of inositol, while interleukin 6 (IL6), interleukin 8 (IL8) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) expression levels were down-regulated by supply of inositol. In head kidney, the mRNA of toll-like receptor 22 (TLR22), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and interleukin 1β (IL1β) expression levels were significantly down-regulated (P < 0.05), which could further lead to remarkable down-regulation of IL6 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) expression (P < 0.05). These results indicated that high-lipid diets with supply of inositol promoted growth, increased the antioxidant capacity, and suppressed the inflammation of the liver and head kidney by inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammation factors (IL6, IL8, TGF-β and TNF-α). In conclusion, these results indicated that dietary inositol promoted growth, improved antioxidant capacity and immunity of hybrid grouper fed high-lipid diets. Based on SGR, broken-line regression analysis showed that 1.66 g/kg inositol supply was recommended in high-lipid diets of juvenile grouper.",Pan S; Yan X; Dong X; Li T; Suo X; Tan B; Zhang S; Li Z; Yang Y; Zhang H,Fish & shellfish immunology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35577318/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35444255,"Multi-omics analyses of serum metabolome, gut microbiome and brain function reveal dysregulated microbiota-gut-brain axis in bipolar depression.","The intricate processes of microbiota-gut-brain communication in modulating human cognition and emotion, especially in the context of mood disorders, have remained elusive. Here we performed faecal metagenomic, serum metabolomics and neuroimaging studies on a cohort of 109 unmedicated patients with depressed bipolar disorder (BD) patients and 40 healthy controls (HCs) to characterise the microbial-gut-brain axis in BD. Across over 12,000 measured metabolic features, we observed a large discrepancy (73.54%) in the serum metabolome between BD patients and HCs, spotting differentially abundant microbial-derived neuroactive metabolites including multiple B-vitamins, kynurenic acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid and short-chain fatty acids. These metabolites could be linked to the abundance of gut microbiota presented with corresponding biosynthetic potentials, including Akkermansia muciniphila, Citrobacter spp. (Citrobacter freundii and Citrobacter werkmanii), Phascolarctobacterium spp., Yersinia spp. (Yersinia frederiksenii and Yersinia aleksiciae), Enterobacter spp. (Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter kobei) and Flavobacterium spp. Based on functional neuroimaging, BD-related neuroactive microbes and metabolites were discovered as potential markers associated with BD-typical features of functional connectivity of brain networks, hinting at aberrant cognitive function, emotion regulation, and interoception. Our study combines gut microbiota and neuroactive metabolites with brain functional connectivity, thereby revealing potential signalling pathways from the microbiota to the gut and the brain, which may have a role in the pathophysiology of BD.",Li Z; Lai J; Zhang P; Ding J; Jiang J; Liu C; Huang H; Zhen H; Xi C; Sun Y; Wu L; Wang L; Gao X; Li Y; Fu Y; Jie Z; Li S; Zhang D; Chen Y; Zhu Y; Lu S; Lu J; Wang D; Zhou H; Yuan X; Li X; Pang L; Huang M; Yang H; Zhang W; Brix S; Kristiansen K; Song X; Nie C; Hu S,Molecular psychiatry,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35444255/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35421572,"Catalytic and regulatory subunits of casein kinase 2 in Penaeus vannamei: Cloning, identification, expression profiles and functional analysis.","As a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase with catalytic and regulatory subunits distributed ubiquitously in eukaryotic organisms, casein kinase 2 (CK2) is involved in multiple cellular functions, including immune regulation. In this study, two variants of the catalytic subunit (designated PvCK2α-1 and PvCK2α-2) and the regulatory subunit homologs (designated PvCK2β-1 and PvCK2β-2) in Penaeus vannamei were cloned and characterised. PvCK2α-1 and PvCK2α-2 shared the same genomic sequence consisting of six exons and five introns and encoded the same protein of 350 amino acids with an S_TKc domain, although there was a sequence deletion in 3'-UTR in PvCK2α-2 when compared with PvCK2α-1. Because of the sequence deletion in the ORF, PvCK2β-1 and PvCK2β-2 encoded different proteins with a CK_II_beta domain. The gene structures of PvCK2β-1 and PvCK2β-2 were identical and consisted of four exons and three introns. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed that PvCK2α and PvCK2β were constitutively expressed in all P. vannamei tissues tested, with higher levels detected in the immune-related tissues including hemocytes, hepatopancreas, gills and intestine. In these four tissue types, all variants of PvCK2α and PvCK2β were induced upon challenge with white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Staphyloccocus aureus. The inhibition of PvCK2α, PvCK2β-1 and PvCK2βComb (the amount of PvCK2β-1 and PvCK2β-2) significantly reduced the survival rates of P. vannamei after WSSV infection and significantly increased the WSSV viral loads. Knockdown of PvCK2 by RNAi could distinctly decrease the expression of NF-κB related genes. All of these results suggest that PvCK2 plays an important role in the innate immune response to pathogen challenges in P. vannamei, with a positive role in anti-WSSV response which may be mediated through regulating the expression of NF-κB drived antimicrobial peptide genes.",Zheng Y; Hou C; Yuan H; Hu N; Tan B; Zhang S,Fish & shellfish immunology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35421572/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35408816,A Novel Family of Winged-Helix Single-Stranded DNA-Binding Proteins from Archaea.,"The winged helix superfamily comprises a large number of structurally related nucleic acid-binding proteins. While these proteins are often shown to bind dsDNA, few are known to bind ssDNA. Here, we report the identification and characterization of Sul7s, a novel winged-helix single-stranded DNA binding protein family highly conserved in <i>Sulfolobaceae</i>. Sul7s from <i>Sulfolobus islandicus</i> binds ssDNA with an affinity approximately 15-fold higher than that for dsDNA in vitro. It prefers binding oligo(dT)<sub>30</sub> over oligo(dC)<sub>30</sub> or a dG-rich 30-nt oligonucleotide, and barely binds oligo(dA)<sub>30</sub>. Further, binding by Sul7s inhibits DNA strand annealing, but shows little effect on the melting temperature of DNA duplexes. The solution structure of Sul7s determined by NMR shows a winged helix-turn-helix fold, consisting of three α-helices, three β-strands, and two short wings. It interacts with ssDNA via a large positively charged binding surface, presumably resulting in ssDNA deformation. Our results shed significant light on not only non-OB fold single-stranded DNA binding proteins in Archaea, but also the divergence of the winged-helix proteins in both function and structure during evolution.",Huang C; Liu X; Chen Y; Zhou J; Li W; Ding N; Huang L; Chen J; Zhang Z,International journal of molecular sciences,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35408816/,0,0,0,0,0,0

In this paper, a universal functional nucleic acid (FNA) lateral flow magnetic biosensor was constructed using blocking super PCR (BS-PCR) and a magnetic test strip (MTS). In theory, the visualized and magnetic output of dsDNA-based amplicons were achieved via ssDNA/dsDNA conversion by blocking linkers in the PCR primers and magnetic probes. In application, high-speed, super-sensitive, highly stable rapid screening was realized by taking advantage of the speediness of the super PCR reactor and the anti-background interference, visualization and high stability of magnetic signal readout. The genetically modified maize MON810 was selected as a double-stranded model target, while 5-min BS-PCR and 5-min magnetic signal readouts achieved the screening results within 10 min. Furthermore, the exponential PCR amplification and magnetic-based sensibilization improved the sensitivity to a single copy.

This study sought to analyze whether three plasma proteins expressed in a largely skin- and gut-restricted manner would be affected by the development of acute cutaneous and gastrointestinal aGvHD. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and prognostic value of plasma cytokeratin-15 (KRT15) cytokeratin-20 (KRT20), and occludin (OCLN) were evaluated in a discovery and a validation cohort using ELISA in comparison with elafin (PI3) and regenerating family member 3 alpha (REG3A), two established markers of skin- and gut aGvHD. The discovery cohort (n = 39) revealed that at the time of diagnosis, plasma KRT20 showed a progressive decrease from unaffected individuals to patients with single-, and patients with multi-organ aGvHD. KRT20 was affected by cutaneous (p = 0.0263) and gastrointestinal aGvHD (p = 0.0242) independently and in an additive manner. Sensitivity and specificity of KRT20 for aGvHD involving both target organs (AUC = 0.852) were comparable to that of PI3 for skin-aGvHD (AUC = 0.708) or that of REG3A for gut-aGvHD (AUC = 0.855). Patient follow-up in the validation cohort (n = 67) corroborated these observations (p < 0.001), and linked low KRT20 to grade 2+ disease (p < 0.001), but failed to confirm low KRT20 as an independent risk factor.

However, few studies have investigated links between obesity and dietary patterns based on discretionary food intake, and the interaction effect of FTO genotype are unknown. Thus, this study aimed to derive dietary patterns based on intake of discretionary foods, saturated fatty acids (SFA) and fibre, and examine cross-sectional associations with BMI and waist circumference (WC), and interaction effects of FTO genotype. Baseline data on 1280 adults from seven European countries were included (the Food4Me study). Dietary intake was estimated from a Food Frequency Questionnaire. Reduced rank regression was used to derive three dietary patterns using response variables of discretionary foods, SFA and fibre density. DNA was extracted from buccal swabs. Anthropometrics were self-measured. Linear regression analyses were used to examine associations between dietary patterns and BMI and WC, with an interaction for FTO genotype. Dietary pattern 1 (positively correlated with discretionary foods and SFA, and inversely correlated with fibre) was associated with higher BMI (β:0.64; 95% CI 0.44, 0.84) and WC (β:1.58; 95% CI 1.08, 2.07). There was limited evidence dietary pattern 2 (positively correlated with discretionary foods and SFA) and dietary pattern 3 (positively correlated with SFA and fibre) were associated with anthropometrics. FTO risk genotype was associated with higher BMI and WC, with no evidence of a dietary interaction. Consuming a dietary pattern low in discretionary foods and high-SFA and low-fibre foods is likely to be important for maintaining a healthy weight, regardless of FTO predisposition to obesity.

35294009,Sex Differences Across the Life Course: A Focus On Unique Nutritional and Health Considerations among Women.,"In the United States, women, while having a longer life expectancy than men, experience a differential risk for chronic diseases and have unique nutritional needs based on physiological and hormonal changes across the life span. However, much of what is known about health is based on research conducted in men. Additional complexity in assessing nutritional needs within gender include the variations in genetics, body compositions, hormonal milieus, underlying chronic diseases, and medication usage, with this list expanding as we consider these variables across the life course. It is clear women experience nutrient shortfalls during key periods of their lives, which may differentially impact their health. Consequently, as we move into the era of precision nutrition, understanding these sex- and gender-based differences may help optimize recommendations and interventions chosen to support health and weight management. Recently, a scientific conference was convened with content experts to explore these topics from a life-course perspective at biological, physiological, and behavioral levels. This publication summarizes the presentations and discussions from the workshop and provides an overview of important nutrition and related lifestyle considerations across the life course. The landscape of addressing female-specific nutritional needs continues to grow; now more than ever, it is essential to increase our understanding of the physiological differences between men and women, and determine how these physiological considerations may aid in optimizing nutritional strategies to support certain personal goals related to health, quality of life, sleep, and exercise performance among women.",Bailey RL; Dog TL; Smith-Ryan AE; Das SK; Baker FC; Madak-Erdogan Z; Hammond BR; Sesso HD; Eapen A; Mitmesser SH; Wong A; Nguyen H,The Journal of nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35294009/,0,0,0,0,0,0

To investigate associations between the expression of circulating adiposity-related miRNAs and the response to a weight loss intervention. A total of 51 Spanish girls (age 7-16 years) with abdominal obesity underwent 8 weeks of a multidisciplinary intervention for weight loss. Participants were stratified into two groups in accordance with changes in body mass index (BMI) standard deviation score: low-responders (LR) and high-responders (HR). The expression of 39 circulating miRNAs (c-miRNAs) was evaluated in plasma of all subjects before the intervention. Six miRNAs were differentially expressed between LR and HR. However, after adjustment for Tanner stage, the association was maintained only for miR-126-3p and miR-221-3p with a higher expression in HR group compared to LR group. After the intervention, miR-221-3p expression decreased in all subjects with a significant difference in the change within groups. However, changes in miR-126-3p levels were not significant. The expression of miR-221-3p was positively correlated with body weight, BMI and waist circumference, and negatively correlated with quantitative insulin sensitivity check index. Bioinformatic analysis evidenced that miR-221-3p participates in several obesity-related pathways, and more interestingly, this miRNA targets several candidate genes to childhood obesity according to DisGeNet database.

Few studies have addressed the association between fatty acid desaturase (<i>FADS</i>) gene expression patterns and fatty acids in breast milk. This research aimed to explore the differences in PUFA levels among breast milk groups with different levels of <i>FADS</i> gene expression and provide a scientific basis for precision nutrition strategies. A total of 50 healthy women 42-45 days postpartum were included in this study. A basic information questionnaire and breast milk samples were collected. Eight types of PUFA were detected, and RNA was extracted from breast milk. The transcription level of the <i>FADS</i> gene was detected using real-time quantitative PCR.

35268025,FTO and ADRB2 Genetic Polymorphisms Are Risk Factors for Earlier Excessive Gestational Weight Gain in Pregnant Women with Pregestational Diabetes Mellitus: Results of a Randomized Nutrigenetic Trial.,"Excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) is associated with increased risk of maternal and neonatal complications. We investigated obesity-related polymorphisms in the FTO gene (rs9939609, rs17817449) and ADRB2 (rs1042713, rs1042714) as candidate risk factors concerning excessive GWG in pregnant women with pregestational diabetes. This nutrigenetic trial, conducted in Brazil, randomly assigned 70 pregnant women to one of the groups: traditional diet (<i>n</i> = 41) or DASH diet (<i>n</i> = 29). Excessive GWG was the total weight gain above the upper limit of the recommendation, according to the Institute of Medicine guidelines. Genotyping was performed using real-time PCR. Time-to-event analysis was performed to investigate risk factors for progression to excessive GWG. Regardless the type of diet, AT carriers of rs9939609 (FTO) and AA carriers of rs1042713 (ADRB2) had higher risk of earlier exceeding GWG compared to TT (aHR 2.44; CI 95% 1.03-5.78; <i>p</i> = 0.04) and GG (aHR 3.91; CI 95% 1.12-13.70; <i>p</i> = 0.03) genotypes, respectively, as the AG carriers for FTO haplotype rs9939609:rs17817449 compared to TT carriers (aHR 1.79; CI 95% 1.04-3.06; <i>p</i> = 0.02).",Santos KD; Rosado EL; da Fonseca ACP; Belfort GP; da Silva LBG; Ribeiro-Alves M; Zembrzuski VM; Martínez JA; Saunders C,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35268025/,0,0,0,0,1,0
35256673,Deprogramming metabolism in pancreatic cancer with a bi-functional GPR55 inhibitor and biased β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic agonist.,"Metabolic reprogramming contributes to oncogenesis, tumor growth, and treatment resistance in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Here we report the effects of (R,S')-4'-methoxy-1-naphthylfenoterol (MNF), a GPR55 antagonist and biased β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>-AR) agonist on cellular signaling implicated in proliferation and metabolism in PDAC cells. The relative contribution of GPR55 and β<sub>2</sub>-AR in (R,S')-MNF signaling was explored further in PANC-1 cells. Moreover, the effect of (R,S')-MNF on tumor growth was determined in a PANC-1 mouse xenograft model. PANC-1 cells treated with (R,S')-MNF showed marked attenuation in GPR55 signal transduction and function combined with increased β<sub>2</sub>-AR/Gα<sub>s</sub>/adenylyl cyclase/PKA signaling, both of which contributing to lower MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT and YAP/TAZ signaling. (R,S')-MNF administration significantly reduced PANC-1 tumor growth and circulating L-lactate concentrations. Global metabolic profiling of (R,S')-MNF-treated tumor tissues revealed decreased glycolytic metabolism, with a shift towards normoxic processes, attenuated glutamate metabolism, and increased levels of ophthalmic acid and its precursor, 2-aminobutyric acid, indicative of elevated oxidative stress. Transcriptomics and immunoblot analyses indicated the downregulation of gene and protein expression of HIF-1α and c-Myc, key initiators of metabolic reprogramming in PDAC. (R,S')-MNF treatment decreased HIF-1α and c-Myc expression, attenuated glycolysis, shifted fatty acid metabolism towards β-oxidation, and suppressed de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis in PANC-1 tumors. The results indicate a potential benefit of combined GPR55 antagonism and biased β<sub>2</sub>-AR agonism in PDAC therapy associated with the deprogramming of altered cellular metabolism.",Wnorowski A; Dudzik D; Bernier M; Wójcik J; Keijzers G; Diaz-Ruiz A; Mazur K; Zhang Y; Han H; Scheibye-Knudsen M; Jozwiak K; Barbas C; Wainer IW,Scientific reports,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35256673/,0,0,0,0,0,0

In addition, a portable polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tube fluorescence reader was built. Further analysis of the MSN/NA-doped nanoflower morphology and the enhancement mechanism indicated that the MSNs aggregated into larger nanoclusters by adsorbing single cross-priming amplification (sCPA) components, forming MSNs/NAs-doped nanoflowers, and increasing the local concentrations to enhance sCPA efficiency. Cyclic amplification relied mainly on the self-folding hairpin-like structure of the amplified product that continuously formed, opened, re-formed, and opened again.

35253371,Milk-Derived Small Extracellular Vesicles Promote Recovery of Intestinal Damage by Accelerating Intestinal Stem Cell-Mediated Epithelial Regeneration.,"Milk-derived small extracellular vesicles (M-sEVs) are critical bioactive components in milk. They are considered to be regulators in milk that may have promising applications. Understanding their biological effects would be important in nutrition. Intestinal organoids and mice are used to explore the effects of M-sEVs on intestinal regeneration. M-sEVs could be absorbed by intestinal epithelia and upregulate expression of the microRNAs (miRNAs) expressed in milk: miR-148a, miR-22, miR-30, and miR-29a. Interestingly, M-sEVs promote proliferation of intestinal epithelia and repairs the epithelial damage that is caused by tumor necrosis factor-α in intestinal organoids. M-sEVs ameliorate intestinal mucosa damage in mice caused by treatment with dextran sulfate sodium, as well as increasing expression of the intestinal stem cells (ISC) markers leucine-rich repeat containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5), olfactomedin 4 (Olfm4), and Achaete-Scute Family BHLH Transcription Factor 2 (Ascl2) and stimulating intestinal epithelial proliferation to repair epithelial damage. Furthermore, miR-29 is more abundant in M-sEVs-treated mice, and miR-29 could upregulate expression of ISC marker genes and accelerates intestinal regeneration to recover damaged intestinal epithelia. We reveal that M-sEVs and miR-29 can accelerate intestinal stem cell-mediated epithelial regeneration and repair epithelial damage.",Lin Y; Lu Y; Huang Z; Wang Y; Song S; Luo Y; Ren F; Guo H,Molecular nutrition & food research,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35253371/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35134821,Validity of continuous glucose monitoring for categorizing glycemic responses to diet: implications for use in personalized nutrition.,"Continuous glucose monitor (CGM) devices enable characterization of individuals' glycemic variation. However, there are concerns about their reliability for categorizing glycemic responses to foods that would limit their potential application in personalized nutrition recommendations. We aimed to evaluate the concordance of 2 simultaneously worn CGM devices in measuring postprandial glycemic responses. Within ZOE PREDICT (Personalised Responses to Dietary Composition Trial) 1, 394 participants wore 2 CGM devices simultaneously [n = 360 participants with 2 Abbott Freestyle Libre Pro (FSL) devices; n = 34 participants with both FSL and Dexcom G6] for ≤14 d while consuming standardized (n = 4457) and ad libitum (n = 5738) meals. We examined the CV and correlation of the incremental area under the glucose curve at 2 h (glucoseiAUC0-2 h). Within-subject meal ranking was assessed using Kendall τ rank correlation. Concordance between paired devices in time in range according to the American Diabetes Association cutoffs (TIRADA) and glucose variability (glucose CV) was also investigated. The CV of glucoseiAUC0-2 h for standardized meals was 3.7% (IQR: 1.7%-7.1%) for intrabrand device and 12.5% (IQR: 5.1%-24.8%) for interbrand device comparisons. Similar estimates were observed for ad libitum meals, with intrabrand and interbrand device CVs of glucoseiAUC0-2 h of 4.1% (IQR: 1.8%-7.1%) and 16.6% (IQR: 5.5%-30.7%), respectively. Kendall τ rank correlation showed glucoseiAUC0-2h-derived meal rankings were agreeable between paired CGM devices (intrabrand: 0.9; IQR: 0.8-0.9; interbrand: 0.7; IQR: 0.5-0.8). Paired CGMs also showed strong concordance for TIRADA with a intrabrand device CV of 4.8% (IQR: 1.9%-9.8%) and an interbrand device CV of 3.2% (IQR: 1.1%-6.2%).

35133187,Stratification of the Gut Microbiota Composition Landscape across the Alzheimer's Disease Continuum in a Turkish Cohort.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a heterogeneous disorder that spans a continuum with multiple phases, including preclinical, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia. Unlike for most other chronic diseases, human studies reporting on AD gut microbiota in the literature are very limited. With the scarcity of approved drugs for AD therapies, the rational and precise modulation of gut microbiota composition using diet and other tools is a promising approach to the management of AD. Such an approach could be personalized if an AD continuum can first be deconstructed into multiple strata based on specific microbiota features by using single or multiomics techniques. However, stratification of AD gut microbiota has not been systematically investigated before, leaving an important research gap for gut microbiota-based therapeutic approaches. Here, we analyze 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of stool samples from 27 patients with mild cognitive impairment, 47 patients with AD, and 51 nondemented control subjects by using tools compatible with the compositional nature of microbiota. To stratify the AD gut microbiota community, we applied four machine learning techniques, including partitioning around the medoid clustering and fitting a probabilistic Dirichlet mixture model, the latent Dirichlet allocation model, and we performed topological data analysis for population-scale microbiome stratification based on the Mapper algorithm. These four distinct techniques all converge on <i>Prevotella</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i> stratification of the gut microbiota across the AD continuum, while some methods provided fine-scale resolution in stratifying the community landscape. Finally, we demonstrate that the signature taxa and neuropsychometric parameters together robustly classify the groups. Our results provide a framework for precision nutrition approaches aiming to modulate the AD gut microbiota. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The prevalence of AD worldwide is estimated to reach 131 million by 2050. Most disease-modifying treatments and drug trials have failed, due partly to the heterogeneous and complex nature of the disease. Recent studies demonstrated that gut dybiosis can influence normal brain function through the so-called ""gut-brain axis."" Modulation of the gut microbiota, therefore, has drawn strong interest in the clinic in the management of the disease. However, there is unmet need for microbiota-informed stratification of AD clinical cohorts for intervention studies aiming to modulate the gut microbiota. Our study fills in this gap and draws attention to the need for microbiota stratification as the first step for microbiota-based therapy. We demonstrate that while <i>Prevotella</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i> clusters are the consensus partitions, the newly developed probabilistic methods can provide fine-scale resolution in partitioning the AD gut microbiome landscape.",Yıldırım S; Nalbantoğlu ÖU; Bayraktar A; Ercan FB; Gündoğdu A; Velioğlu HA; Göl MF; Soylu AE; Koç F; Gülpınar EA; Kadak KS; Arıkan M; Mardinoğlu A; Koçak M; Köseoğlu E; Hanoğlu L,mSystems,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35133187/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35124351,Precision intestinal nutrition: knowledge and gaps regarding the role of amino acids during an enteric challenge.,"Poultry nutritionists continually strive for more ""precision"" nutritional programs that provide the exact balance of nutrients that maximize broiler growth performance without economically and environmentally costly excesses. Many factors affect the precise amount and balance of nutrients needed by the broiler, including genetics, age, sex, and environment. Furthermore, broilers in intensive rearing environments will almost always be subjected to some degree of enteric stress that can alter nutrient needs. Exposure to enteric pathogens such as Eimeria spp., the intestinal parasites that cause avian coccidiosis, induces physical damage to the intestinal epithelium and activates immune responses, ultimately resulting in the repartitioning of amino acids (AA) in response to these prioritized demands. Even without any pathogenic challenge, the intestine has an already high demand for many AA, with 30 to 100% of dietary AA extracted during first pass intestinal metabolism. In many cases, increasing dietary protein from intact proteins has been shown to be a viable option to ameliorate impaired AA digestion and absorption and heightened need for certain AA of birds under an enteric stress. However, increasing dietary protein often results in concomitant increases in indigestible protein and carbohydrates that can stimulate the overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria (i.e., Clostridium perfringens). Alternative options to increase dietary AA levels are to increase all feed-grade, free AA (e.g., Met, Lys, Thr, Val), or specific individual feed-grade AA. Therefore, the objectives of this paper are to discuss precision nutrition, the dietary AA demands of the intestine, consequences of coccidiosis on AA needs of the intestine, and formulation approaches to meet these altered needs. In summary, increased dietary protein met by intact proteins has consistently demonstrated its benefits during an Eimeria spp. infection; however, to further the goal of precision nutritional programs, feeding higher levels of a specific AA to support desired functions such as intestinal recovery or immune function for birds experiencing an enteric stress still require further evaluation.",Lee DT; Rochell SJ,Poultry science,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35124351/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35116034,Integrated Analysis of mRNA-Seq and MiRNA-Seq Reveals the Molecular Mechanism of the Intestinal Immune Response in <i>Marsupenaeus japonicus</i> Under Decapod Iridescent Virus 1 Infection.,"The intestine is not only an important digestive organ but also an important immune organ for shrimp; it plays a key role in maintaining homeostasis. Decapod iridescent virus 1 (DIV1) is a new type of shrimp-lethal virus that has received extensive attention in recent years. To date, most studies of the shrimp intestinal immune response under viral infections have relied on single omics analyses; there is a lack of systematic multi-omics research. In the current study, intestinal mRNA-seq and microRNA (miRNA)-seq analyses of <i>Marsupenaeus japonicus</i> under DIV1 infection were performed. A total of 1,976 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 32 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were identified. Among them, 21 DEMs were negatively correlated with 194 DEGs from a total of 223 correlations. Functional annotation analysis revealed that <i>M. japonicus</i> can regulate glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis (chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and keratan sulfate), vitamin metabolism (retinol metabolism and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism), immune pathway activation (Toll and IMD signaling pathways, Wnt signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, and Hippo signaling pathway), immunity enzyme activity promotion (triose-phosphate isomerase), antimicrobial peptide (AMP) expression, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and cell apoptosis through miRNAs to participate in the host's antiviral immune response, while DIV1 can influence Warburg effect-related pathways (pyruvate metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and citrate cycle), glycosphingolipid biosynthesis-related pathways (glycosphingolipid biosynthesis-globo and isoglobo series and glycosphingolipid biosynthesis-lacto and neolacto series), and the tight junction and adhesion junction of the intestinal mucosal epithelium through the host's miRNAs and mRNA to promote its own invasion and replication. These results indicate that intestinal miRNAs play important roles in the shrimp immune response against DIV1 infection. This study provides a basis for further study of the shrimp intestinal antiviral immune response and for the formulation of effective new strategies for the prevention and treatment of DIV1 infection.",He Z; Zhong Y; Hou D; Hu X; Fu Z; Liu L; Zhang S; Sun C,Frontiers in immunology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35116034/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35102609,Nfatc1<sup>+</sup> colonic stem cells contribute to regeneration upon colitis.,"Colonic stem cells play important roles in both normal epithelial turnover and injury repair. Lgr5<sup>+</sup> colonic stem cells are highly susceptible to DSS-induced damage. However, it is still unclear how colonic stem cells regenerate injured epithelium during colitis. Here, we explored the functions of a new population of NFATc1<sup>+</sup> colonic stem cells in experimental colitis. Nfatc1<sup>+</sup> colonic stem cells were labeled using Nfatc1<sup>CreERT2</sup> ;R26<sup>mTmG</sup> reporter mice. Immunostaining assays were used to detect Goblet cells, enteroendocrine cells, and intestinal stem/progenitor cells. We performed lineage tracing assay to investigate whether Nfatc1<sup>+</sup> cells are real colonic stem cells using Nfatc1<sup>CreERT2</sup> ;R26<sup>mTmG</sup> mice. The contribution of Nfatc1<sup>+</sup> stem cells on epithelial regeneration was detected in experimental colitis induced by DSS. Nfatc1-reporter marked cells are enriched for +3 to +5 position in colonic crypts, and they are overlapped with Sox9<sup>+</sup> cells and Hopx<sup>+</sup> cells that have been identified as stem cells in small intestine. However, Nfatc1-reporter marked cells are not overlapped with Lgr5<sup>+</sup> colonic stem cells, as well as differentiated goblet cells and enteroendocrine cells. Furthermore, Nfatc1-reporter marked cells are able to give rise to all lineages of the colonic epithelium, and they preferentially contribute to the regeneration of colonic epithelium in DSS-induced experimental colitis.

35050078,DNA Methylation Changes and Its Associated Genes in Mulberry (<i>Morus alba</i> L.) Yu-711 Response to Drought Stress Using MethylRAD Sequencing.,"Drought stress remains one of the most detrimental environmental cues affecting plant growth and survival. In this work, the DNA methylome changes in mulberry leaves under drought stress (EG) and control (CK) and their impact on gene regulation were investigated by MethylRAD sequencing. The results show 138,464 (37.37%) and 56,241 (28.81%) methylation at the CG and CWG sites (W = A or T), respectively, in the mulberry genome between drought stress and control. The distribution of the methylome was prevalent in the intergenic, exonic, intronic and downstream regions of the mulberry plant genome. In addition, we discovered 170 DMGs (129 in CG sites and 41 in CWG sites) and 581 DMS (413 in CG sites and 168 in CWG sites). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis indicates that phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, spliceosome, amino acid biosynthesis, carbon metabolism, RNA transport, plant hormone, signal transduction pathways, and quorum sensing play a crucial role in mulberry response to drought stress. Furthermore, the qRT-PCR analysis indicates that the selected 23 genes enriched in the KEGG pathways are differentially expressed, and 86.96% of the genes share downregulated methylation and 13.04% share upregulation methylation status, indicating the complex link between DNA methylation and gene regulation. This study serves as fundamentals in discovering the epigenomic status and the pathways that will significantly enhance mulberry breeding for adaptation to a wide range of environments.",Ackah M; Guo L; Li S; Jin X; Asakiya C; Aboagye ET; Yuan F; Wu M; Essoh LG; Adjibolosoo D; Attaribo T; Zhang Q; Qiu C; Lin Q; Zhao W,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35050078/,0,0,0,0,0,0
34970413,FOXO1 Is a Critical Switch Molecule for Autophagy and Apoptosis of Sow Endometrial Epithelial Cells Caused by Oxidative Stress.,"Oxidative stress (OS) is involved in various reproductive diseases and can induce autophagy and apoptosis, which determine the different fates of cells. However, the sequence and the switch mechanism between autophagy and apoptosis are unclear. Here, we reported that chronic restraint stress (CRS) induced OS (decreased T-AOC, T-SOD, CAT and GSH-Px and increased MDA) and then disturbed the endocrine environment of sows during early pregnancy, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axes. Meanwhile, after CRS, the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway was inhibited and attenuated the antioxidative ability to cause OS of the endometrium. The norepinephrine (NE) triggered <i>β</i> <sub>2</sub>-AR to activate the FOXO1/NF-<i>κ</i>B pathway, which induced endometrial inflammation. CRS induced the caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway and caused MAP1LC3-II accumulation, SQSTM1/p62 degradation, and autophagosome formation to initiate autophagy. Furthermore, <i>in vitro</i>, a cellular OS model was established by adding hydrogen peroxide into cells. Low OS maintained the viability of endometrial epithelial cells by triggering autophagy, while high OS induced cell death by initiating caspase-dependent apoptosis. Autophagy preceded the occurrence of apoptosis, which depended on the subcellular localization of FOXO1. In the low OS group, FOXO1 was exported from the nucleus to be modified into Ac-FOXO1 and bound to ATG7 in the cytoplasm, which promoted autophagy to protect cells. In the high OS group, FOXO1 located in the nucleus to promote transcription of proapoptotic proteins and then induce apoptosis. Here, FOXO1, as a redox sensor switch, regulated the transformation of cell autophagy and apoptosis. In summary, the posttranslational modification of FOXO1 may become the target of OS treatment.",Lu J; Huang J; Zhao S; Xu W; Chen Y; Li Y; Wang Z; Dong Y; You R; Cao J; Dong Y,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34970413/,0,0,0,0,0,0
34952194,Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) plays a positive role during WSSV and Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection in Litopenaeus vannamei.,"Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) is involved in immune defence reactions by providing the starting material, tyrosine, to synthesise catecholamines and melanin. PAH is an important metabolic enzyme of aromatic amino acids and the rate-limiting enzyme in the hydroxylation of amino acid phenylalanine to tyrosine. In the present study, a PAH gene, LvPAH, was cloned and identified from Litopenaeus vannamei. The open reading frame (ORF) of LvPAH was 1383 bp, encoding a protein of 460 amino acids comprised of an ACT domain and a Biopterin_H domain. LvPAH was constitutively expressed in healthy L. vannamei, with the highest expression levels in the eyestalk and the lowest in the hepatopancreas. Both white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) and Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection upregulated LvPAH expression in hemocytes, hepatopancreas and gills of L. vannamei. Inhibition of LvPAH resulted in a significantly lower survival rate of L. vannamei after WSSV infection than the control group, consistent with the observation that WSSV viral load was significantly higher in LvPAH-silenced L. vannamei. After a V. parahaemolyticus challenge, there was no significant difference between the survival rate of LvPAH-silenced and the control L. vannamei. However, the load of V. parahaemolyticus in LvPAH-silenced L. vannamei was significantly higher than the control population for L. vannamei. The effect of LvPAH on L. vannamei from a neuroendocrinological perspective was assessed by measuring l-DOPA, dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NE) levels in the hemocytes after the knockdown of LvPAH. The results showed that phenoloxidase (PO), l-DOPA and DA levels in the hemolymph of LvPAH-silenced L. vannamei were significantly decreased starting from 24hpi. In contrast, the NE levels in the hemolymph of shrimp decreased significantly at first and then increased. The results suggest that LvPAH may play an important role in antiviral and bacterial immunity in L. vannamei.",Yao Y; Shi L; Xiao W; Guo S; Liu S; Li H; Zhang S,Fish & shellfish immunology,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34952194/,0,0,0,0,0,0
34950130,The Chemokine Receptor CCR5 Links Memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T Cell Metabolism to T Cell Antigen Receptor Nanoclustering.,"The inhibition of anabolic pathways, such as aerobic glycolysis, is a metabolic cornerstone of memory T cell differentiation and function. However, the signals that hamper these anabolic pathways are not completely known. Recent evidence pinpoints the chemokine receptor CCR5 as an important player in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell memory responses by regulating T cell antigen receptor (TCR) nanoclustering in an antigen-independent manner. This paper reports that CCR5 specifically restrains aerobic glycolysis in memory-like CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, but not in effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. CCR5-deficient memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells thus show an abnormally high glycolytic/oxidative metabolism ratio. No CCR5-dependent change in glucose uptake nor in the expression of the main glucose transporters was detected in any of the examined cell types, although CCR5-deficient memory cells did show increased expression of the hexokinase 2 and pyruvate kinase M2 isoforms, plus the concomitant downregulation of Bcl-6, a transcriptional repressor of these key glycolytic enzymes. Further, the TCR nanoclustering defects observed in CCR5-deficient antigen-experienced CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were partially reversed by incubation with 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), suggesting a link between inhibition of the glycolytic pathway and TCR nanoscopic organization. Indeed, the treatment of CCR5-deficient lymphoblasts with 2-DG enhanced IL-2 production after antigen re-stimulation. These results identify CCR5 as an important regulator of the metabolic fitness of memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and reveal an unexpected link between T cell metabolism and TCR organization with potential influence on the response of memory T cells upon antigen re-encounter.",Blanco R; Gómez de Cedrón M; Gámez-Reche L; Martín-Leal A; González-Martín A; Lacalle RA; Ramírez de Molina A; Mañes S,Frontiers in immunology,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34950130/,0,0,0,0,0,0
34901112,The Functional Role of Lactoferrin in Intestine Mucosal Immune System and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is one of the main types of intestinal inflammatory diseases with intestine mucosal immune disorder. Intestine mucosal immune system plays a remarkable and important role in the etiology and pathogenesis of IBD. Therefore, understanding the intestine mucosal immune mechanism is a key step to develop therapeutic interventions for IBD. Intestine mucosal immune system and IBD are influenced by various factors, such as inflammation, gut permeability, gut microbiota, and nutrients. Among these factors, emerging evidence show that nutrients play a key role in inflammation activation, integrity of intestinal barrier, and immune cell modulation. Lactoferrin (LF), an iron-binding glycoprotein belonging to transferrin family, is a dietary bioactive component abundantly found in mammalian milk. Notably, LF has been reported to perform diverse biological functions including antibacterial activity, anti-inflammatory activity, intestinal barrier protection, and immune cell modulation, and is involved in maintaining intestine mucosal immune homeostasis. The improved understanding of the properties of LF in intestine mucosal immune system and IBD will facilitate its application in nutrition, clinical medicine, and health. Herein, this review outlines the recent advancements on LF as a potential therapeutic intervention for IBD associated with intestine mucosal immune system dysfunction. We hope this review will provide a reference for future studies and lay a theoretical foundation for LF-based therapeutic interventions for IBD by understanding the particular effects of LF on intestine mucosal immune system.",Liu N; Feng G; Zhang X; Hu Q; Sun S; Sun J; Sun Y; Wang R; Zhang Y; Wang P; Li Y,Frontiers in nutrition,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34901112/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34857775,"Multiomics analysis of soybean meal induced marine fish enteritis in juvenile pearl gentian grouper, Epinephelus fuscoguttatus ♀ × Epinephelus lanceolatus ♂.","As an important protein source, soybean products can cause intestinal inflammation and injury in many animals including human beings, particularly infants and juvenile individuals. Research in this field has been performed for terrestrial animals and fish, but still lacks integrity and systematicness. In this study, the main biological processes in the intestinal tract of marine fish juvenile pearl gentian grouper in the state of soybean meal-induced enteritis (SBMIE) were analyzed. A total of 720 groupers with an approximate initial weight of 12.5 g were randomly divided into three groups: the fish meal (FM) control group, the 20% SBM group (SBM20), and the SBM40 group (n = 4). Three iso-nitrogenous and iso-lipidic diets were prepared and fed to fish for 10 weeks. Each barrel contained a water volume of about 1 m<sup>3</sup> in and was exposed to natural light and temperature. Results indicated that the growth and physiology of groupers fed with SBM were significantly negatively affected, with the gene expressions of intestinal structural protein abnormal. 16SrDNA high-throughput sequencing showed that the intestinal microflora played an important role in the pathogenesis of pearl gentian grouper SBMIE, which may activate a variety of pathogen pattern recognition receptors, such as toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors, and nod-like receptors. Transcriptome analysis revealed that changes of the SBMIE signaling pathway in pearl gentian groupers were conservative to some extent than that of terrestrial animals and freshwater fish. Moreover, the TLRs-nuclear factor kappa-B signaling pathway becomes activated, which played an important role in SBMIE. Meanwhile, the signal pathways related to nutrient absorption and metabolism were generally inhibited. Metabolomics analysis showed that isoflavones and saponins accounted for a large proportion in the potential biomarkers of pearl gentian grouper SBMIE, and most of the biomarkers had significantly positive or negative correlations with each other; 56 metabolites were exchanged between intestinal tissues and contents, which may play an important role in the development of enteritis, including unsaturated fatty acids, organic acids, amino acids, vitamins, small peptides, and nucleotides, etc. These results provide a basic theoretical reference for solving the intestinal issues of fish SBMIE and research of inflammatory bowel disease in mammals.",Zhang W; Tan B; Deng J; Haitao Z,Scientific reports,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34857775/,0,0,0,0,0,0
34830809,Transcriptional and Mutational Profiling of B-Other Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia for Improved Diagnostics.,"B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) is the most common cancer in children, and significant progress has been made in diagnostics and the treatment of this disease based on the subtypes of BCP-ALL. However, in a large proportion of cases (B-other), recurrent BCP-ALL-associated genomic alterations remain unidentifiable by current diagnostic procedures. In this study, we performed RNA sequencing and analyzed gene fusions, expression profiles, and mutations in diagnostic samples of 185 children with BCP-ALL. Gene expression clustering showed that a subset of B-other samples partially clusters with some of the known subgroups, particularly <i>DUX4</i>-positive. Mutation analysis coupled with gene expression profiling revealed the presence of distinctive BCP-ALL subgroups, characterized by the presence of mutations in known ALL driver genes, e.g., <i>PAX5</i> and <i>IKZF1</i>. Moreover, we identified novel fusion partners of lymphoid lineage transcriptional factors <i>ETV6</i>, <i>IKZF1</i> and <i>PAX5</i>. In addition, we report on low blast count detection thresholds and show that the use of EDTA tubes for sample collection does not have adverse effects on sequencing and downstream analysis. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the applicability of whole-transcriptome sequencing for personalized diagnostics in pediatric ALL, including tentative classification of the B-other cases that are difficult to diagnose using conventional methods.",Chouvarine P; Antić Ž; Lentes J; Schröder C; Alten J; Brüggemann M; Carrillo-de Santa Pau E; Illig T; Laguna T; Schewe D; Stanulla M; Tang M; Zimmermann M; Schrappe M; Schlegelberger B; Cario G; Bergmann AK,Cancers,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34830809/,0,0,0,0,0,0
34815046,"Graphene oxide nanosheet-mediated fluorescent RPA ""turn-on"" biosensor for rapid RNAi transgenic plant detection.","In this paper preliminarily verified that graphene oxide (GO) nanomaterials enhanced the recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA). GO nanosheets improved the efficiency of RPA amplification by absorbing ingredients to induce local aggregation. The recombinase initially aggregated with the primers to form nucleoprotein filaments, absorbed on the GO nanosheets, changing the structure. Therefore, an isothermal fluorescence biosensor was developed based on GO nanosheets enhanced the RPA to detect RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic plants. FAM-labeled primers were absorbed and quenched by the GO nanosheets. After amplification, the primers were extended into double-stranded DNA, detaching from the GO surface to recover the fluorescent signal. The biosensor displayed high sensitivity and selectivity and showed an excellent relationship ranging from 1.5 to 100 ng of genome DNA, with a detection limit (LOD) of 1.5 ng. Consequently, the biosensor provides an enhanced isothermal method for detecting genetically modified (GM) products and exhibits significant potential for molecular detection.",Li K; Lei Z; Zhang C; Zhu L; Huang K; Shang Y; Xu W,Analytica chimica acta,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34815046/,0,0,0,0,0,0
34753921,Diet composition influences the metabolic benefits of short cycles of very low caloric intake.,"Diet composition, calories, and fasting times contribute to the maintenance of health. However, the impact of very low-calorie intake (VLCI) achieved with either standard laboratory chow (SD) or a plant-based fasting mimicking diet (FMD) is not fully understood. Here, using middle-aged male mice we show that 5 months of short 4:10 VLCI cycles lead to decreases in both fat and lean mass, accompanied by improved physical performance and glucoregulation, and greater metabolic flexibility independent of diet composition. A long-lasting metabolomic reprograming in serum and liver is observed in mice on VLCI cycles with SD, but not FMD. Further, when challenged with an obesogenic diet, cycles of VLCI do not prevent diet-induced obesity nor do they elicit a long-lasting metabolic memory, despite achieving modest metabolic flexibility. Our results highlight the importance of diet composition in mediating the metabolic benefits of short cycles of VLCI.",Diaz-Ruiz A; Rhinesmith T; Pomatto-Watson LCD; Price NL; Eshaghi F; Ehrlich MR; Moats JM; Carpenter M; Rudderow A; Brandhorst S; Mattison JA; Aon MA; Bernier M; Longo VD; de Cabo R,Nature communications,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34753921/,0,0,0,0,0,0
34681805,Trimethylamine <i>n</i>-Oxide (TMAO) Modulates the Expression of Cardiovascular Disease-Related microRNAs and Their Targets.,"Diet is a well-known risk factor of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Some microRNAs (miRNAs) have been described to regulate molecular pathways related to CVDs. Diet can modulate miRNAs and their target genes. Choline, betaine, and l-carnitine, nutrients found in animal products, are metabolized into trimethylamine <i>n</i>-oxide (TMAO), which has been associated with CVD risk. The aim of this study was to investigate TMAO regulation of CVD-related miRNAs and their target genes in cellular models of liver and macrophages. We treated HEPG-2, THP-1, mouse liver organoids, and primary human macrophages with 6 µM TMAO at different timepoints (4, 8, and 24 h for HEPG-2 and mouse liver organoids, 12 and 24 h for THP-1, and 12 h for primary human macrophages) and analyzed the expression of a selected panel of CVD-related miRNAs and their target genes and proteins by real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. HEPG-2 cells were transfected with anti-miR-30c and syn-miR-30c. TMAO increased the expression of miR-21-5p and miR-30c-5p. <i>PER2</i>, a target gene of both, decreased its expression with TMAO in HEPG-2 and mice liver organoids but increased its mRNA expression with syn-miR-30c. We concluded that TMAO modulates the expression of miRNAs related to CVDs, and that such modulation affects their target genes.",Díez-Ricote L; Ruiz-Valderrey P; Micó V; Blanco-Rojo R; Tomé-Carneiro J; Dávalos A; Ordovás JM; Daimiel L,International journal of molecular sciences,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34681805/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Increasing evidence indicates that supplementation with probiotics could improve the symptoms of IBD. It is scientifically significant to identify novel and valid strains for treating IBD. It has been reported that the probiotic <i>Lactobacillus paracasei</i> L9 (L9), which is identified from the gut of healthy centenarians, can modulate host immunity and plays an anti-allergic role. Here, we demonstrated that L9 alleviates the pathological phenotypes of experimental colitis by expanding the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria. Oral administration of sodium butyrate in experimental colitis recapitulates the L9 anti-inflammatory phenotypes. Mechanistically, sodium butyrate ameliorated the inflammatory responses by inhibiting the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway in colitis. Overall, these findings demonstrated that L9 alleviates the DSS-induced colitis development by enhancing the abundance of butyrate-producing bacterial strains that produce butyrate to suppress the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway, providing new insight into a promising therapeutic target for the remission of IBD.",Deng M; Wu X; Duan X; Xu J; Yang X; Sheng X; Lou P; Shao C; Lv C; Yu Z,Food & function,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34605504/,0,0,0,0,0,0
34502301,The Regulatory Network of Sturgeon Chondroitin Sulfate on Colorectal Cancer Inhibition by Transcriptomic and Proteomic Analysis.,"Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is a food-derived bioactive substance with multiple biological functions, which exists in animal cartilage and/or bone. Sturgeon, a type of cartilaginous fish, is rich in CS. Our recent study demonstrated the effect of sturgeon chondroitin sulfate (SCS) on reducing colorectal cancer cell proliferation and tumor formation. However, the molecular mechanisms of its anticancer activity remain unknown. In this study, the cell proliferation assay and flow cytometric analysis were used to examine the cell viability and apoptosis of colon cancer cell HT-29 cells and normal colonic epithelial cell NCM460 cells. Transcriptomic and proteomic studies were used to identify the main targets of SCS. SCS showed little effect on the genes/proteins expression profile of NCM460 cells but more sensitive to HT-29, in which 188 genes and 10 proteins were differentially expressed after SCS treatment. Enrichment analysis of those genes/proteins showed that the majority of them are involved in DNA replication, cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot were used to determine essential genes/proteins and networks targeted by SCS to exert inhibiting the development of colorectal cancer function.

34453080,"Dietary supplementation of β-conglycinin, with or without sodium butyrate on the growth, immune response and intestinal health of hybrid grouper.","We investigated the effects of low and high doses of β-conglycinin and the ameliorative effects of sodium butyrate (based on high-dose β-conglycinin) on the growth performance, serum immunity, distal intestinal histopathology, and gene, protein expression related to intestinal health in hybrid grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus ♀ × E. lanceolatus ♂). The results revealed that the instantaneous growth rate (IGR) of grouper significantly increased, decreased, and increased in the low-dose β-conglycinin (bL), high-level β-conglycinin (bH) and high-level β-conglycinin plus sodium butyrate (bH-NaB), respectively. The feed coefficient ratio (FCR) was significantly increased in the bH and bH-NaB, serum levels of IFN-γ, IL-1β, and TNF-α were upregulated in the bH. The intestinal diameter/fold height ratio was significantly increased in the bH. Furthermore, there were increases in nitric oxide (NO), total nitric oxide synthase (total NOS), and peroxynitrite anion (ONOO<sup>-</sup>) in the bH, and decreases in total NOS and ONOO<sup>-</sup> in the bH-NaB. In the distal intestine, IL-1β and TGF-β1 mRNA levels were downregulated and upregulated, respective in the bL. The mRNA levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were upregulated in the bH, and downregulated in the bH-NaB, respectively. Occludin, claudin3 and ZO-3 mRNA levels were upregulated in the bL, downregulated in the bH and then upregulated in the bH-NaB. No significant differences were observed in the mRNA levels of IFN-γ and jam4. And the p-PI3K p85<sup>Tyr458</sup>/total PI3K p85 value was significantly increased in the bH and then decreased in the bH-NaB, and the total Akt value was significantly increased in the bH. These indicate β-conglycinin has a regulatory effect on serum immunity and affect distal intestinal development by modulating distal intestinal injury-related parameters. Within the distal intestinal tract, low- and high-dose β-conglycinin differentially affect immune responses and tight junctions in the distal intestine, which eventually manifests as a reduction in growth performance. Supplementing feed with sodium butyrate might represent an effective approach for enhancing serum immunity, and protects the intestines from damage caused by high-dose β-conglycinin.",Yin B; Liu H; Tan B; Dong X; Chi S; Yang Q; Zhang S,Scientific reports,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34453080/,0,0,0,0,0,0
34373759,Milk-derived extracellular vesicles alleviate ulcerative colitis by regulating the gut immunity and reshaping the gut microbiota.,"<b>Rationale:</b> Bovine milk constitutes an essential part of human diet, especially for children, due to its enrichment of various nutrients. We recently developed an effective protocol for the isolation of extracellular vesicles from milk (mEVs) and discovered that mEVs contained large amounts of immune-active proteins and modulated the gut immunity and microbiota in healthy mice. Here, we aimed to explore the therapeutic effects of mEVs on inflammatory bowel disease. <b>Methods:</b> MicroRNAs and protein content in mEVs were analyzed by RNA sequencing and proteomics, respectively, followed by functional annotation. Ulcerative colitis (UC) was induced by feeding mice with dextran sulfate sodium. Intestinal immune cell populations were phenotyped by flow cytometry, and the gut microbiota was analyzed <i>via</i> 16S rRNA sequencing. <b>Results:</b> We showed that abundant proteins and microRNAs in mEVs were involved in the regulation of immune and inflammatory pathways and that oral administration of mEVs prevented colon shortening, reduced intestinal epithelium disruption, inhibited infiltration of inflammatory cells and tissue fibrosis in a mouse UC model. Mechanistically, mEVs attenuated inflammatory response <i>via</i> inhibiting TLR4-NF-κB signaling pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Furthermore, mEVs were able to correct cytokine production disorder and restore the balance between T helper type 17 (Th17) cells and interleukin-10<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T (Treg) cells in the inflamed colon. The disturbed gut microbiota in UC was also partially recovered upon treatment with mEVs. The correlation between the gut microbiota and cytokines suggests that mEVs may modulate intestinal immunity <i>via</i> influencing the gut microbiota. <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings reveal that mEVs alleviate colitis by regulating intestinal immune homeostasis <i>via</i> inhibiting TLR4-NF-κB and NLRP3 signaling pathways, restoring Treg/Th17 cell balance, and reshaping the gut microbiota.",Tong L; Hao H; Zhang Z; Lv Y; Liang X; Liu Q; Liu T; Gong P; Zhang L; Cao F; Pastorin G; Lee CN; Chen X; Wang JW; Yi H,Theranostics,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34373759/,0,0,0,0,0,0
34360741,An Overview of Adipose Tissue ACE2 Modulation by Diet and Obesity. Potential Implications in COVID-19 Infection and Severity.,"The present review is aimed at analysing the current evidence concerning the potential modulation of obesity and/or diet in adipose tissue ACE2. Additionally, the potential implications of these effects on COVID-19 are also addressed. The results published show that diet and obesity are two factors that effectively influence the expression of <i>Ace2</i> gene in adipose tissue. However, the shifts in this gene do not always occur in the same direction, nor with the same intensity. Additionally, there is no consensus regarding the implications of increased adipose tissue ACE2 expression in health. Thus, while in some studies a protective role is attributed to ACE2 overexpression, other studies suggest otherwise. Similarly, there is much debate regarding the role played by ACE2 in COVID-19 in terms of degree of infection and disease outcomes. The greater risk of infection that may hypothetically derive from enhanced ACE2 expression is not clear since the functionality of the enzyme seems to be as important as the abundance. Thus, the greater abundance of ACE2 in adipose tissue of obese subjects may be counterbalanced by its lower activation. In addition, a protective role of ACE2 overexpression has also been suggested, associated with the increase in anti-inflammatory factors that it may produce.",Gómez-Zorita S; Milton-Laskibar I; García-Arellano L; González M; Portillo MP,International journal of molecular sciences,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34360741/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34360695,The Mechanism of Secretion and Metabolism of Gut-Derived 5-Hydroxytryptamine.,"Serotonin, also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), is a metabolite of tryptophan and is reported to modulate the development and neurogenesis of the enteric nervous system, gut motility, secretion, inflammation, sensation, and epithelial development. Approximately 95% of 5-HT in the body is synthesized and secreted by enterochromaffin (EC) cells, the most common type of neuroendocrine cells in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, through sensing signals from the intestinal lumen and the circulatory system. Gut microbiota, nutrients, and hormones are the main factors that play a vital role in regulating 5-HT secretion by EC cells. Apart from being an important neurotransmitter and a paracrine signaling molecule in the gut, gut-derived 5-HT was also shown to exert other biological functions (in autism and depression) far beyond the gut. Moreover, studies conducted on the regulation of 5-HT in the immune system demonstrated that 5-HT exerts anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory effects on the gut by binding to different receptors under intestinal inflammatory conditions. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms through which 5-HT participates in cell metabolism and physiology can provide potential therapeutic strategies for treating intestinal diseases. Herein, we review recent evidence to recapitulate the mechanisms of synthesis, secretion, regulation, and biofunction of 5-HT to improve the nutrition and health of humans.",Liu N; Sun S; Wang P; Sun Y; Hu Q; Wang X,International journal of molecular sciences,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34360695/,1,0,0,0,0,0

34267193,GPX4 and vitamin E cooperatively protect hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis.,"Ferroptosis, a newly defined mode of regulated cell death caused by unbalanced lipid redox metabolism, is implicated in various tissue injuries and tumorigenesis. However, the role of ferroptosis in stem cells has not yet been investigated. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) is a critical suppressor of lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Here, we study the function of GPX4 and ferroptosis in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in mice with Gpx4 deficiency in the hematopoietic system. We find that Gpx4 deletion solely in the hematopoietic system has no significant effect on the number and function of HSPCs in mice. Notably, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and hematopoietic progenitor cells lacking Gpx4 accumulated lipid peroxidation and underwent ferroptosis in vitro. α-Tocopherol, the main component of vitamin E, was shown to rescue the Gpx4-deficient HSPCs from ferroptosis in vitro. When Gpx4 knockout mice were fed a vitamin E-depleted diet, a reduced number of HSPCs and impaired function of HSCs were found. Furthermore, increased levels of lipid peroxidation and cell death indicated that HSPCs undergo ferroptosis. Collectively, we demonstrate that GPX4 and vitamin E cooperatively maintain lipid redox balance and prevent ferroptosis in HSPCs.",Hu Q; Zhang Y; Lou H; Ou Z; Liu J; Duan W; Wang H; Ge Y; Min J; Wang F; Ju Z,Cell death & disease,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34267193/,0,0,0,0,0,0
34258867,Reducing embryonic mtDNA copy number alters epigenetic profile of key hepatic lipolytic genes and causes abnormal lipid accumulation in adult mice.,"Adverse fetal environment, in particular a shortage or excess of nutrients, is associated with increased risks of metabolic diseases later in life. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this developmental origin of adult diseases remain unclear. Here, we directly tested the role of mitochondrial stress in mediating fetal programming in mice by enzymatically depleting mtDNA in zygotes. mtDNA-targeted plasmid microinjection is used to reduce embryonic mtDNA copy number directly, followed by embryo transfer. Mice with reduced zygote mtDNA copy number were born morphologically normal and showed no accelerated body weight gain. However, at 5 months of age these mice showed markedly increased hepatic lipidosis and became glucose-intolerant. Hepatic mRNA and protein expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (Pparα), a key transcriptional regulator of lipid metabolism, were significantly decreased as a result of increased DNA methylation in its proximal regulatory region. These results indicate that perturbation of mitochondrial function around the periconceptional period causes hypermethylation and thus suppressed expression of PPARα in fetal liver, leading to impaired hepatic lipid metabolism. Our findings provide the first direct evidence that mitochondrial stress mediates epigenetic changes associated with fetal programming of adult diseases in a mammalian system.",Wang Y; Wang X; Long Q; Liu Y; Yin T; Sirota I; Ren F; Gu Z; Luo J,The FEBS journal,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34258867/,0,0,0,0,0,0
34222308,Polyphenol-Rich <i>Aronia melanocarpa</i> Juice Consumption Affects <i>LINE-1</i> DNA Methylation in Peripheral Blood Leukocytes in Dyslipidemic Women.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is associated with alterations in DNA methylation and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) profile, both modulated by dietary polyphenols. The present parallel, placebo-controlled study (part of the original clinical study registered as NCT02800967 at www.clinicaltrials.gov) aimed to determine the impact of 4-week daily consumption of polyphenol-rich <i>Aronia melanocarpa</i> juice (AMJ) treatment on <i>Long Interspersed Nucleotide Element-1</i> (<i>LINE-1</i>) methylation in peripheral blood leukocytes and on plasma PUFAs, in subjects (<i>n</i> = 54, age range of 40.2 ± 6.7 years) at moderate CVD risk, including an increased body mass index, central obesity, high normal blood pressure, and/or dyslipidemia. The goal was also to examine whether factors known to affect DNA methylation (folate intake levels, <i>MTHFR</i> C677T gene variant, anthropometric and metabolic parameters) modulated the <i>LINE-1</i> methylation levels upon the consumption of polyphenol-rich aronia juice. Experimental analysis of <i>LINE-1</i> methylation was done by MethyLight method. <i>MTHFR</i> C677T genotypes were determined by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method, and folate intake was assessed by processing the data from the food frequency questionnaire. PUFAs were measured by gas-liquid chromatography, and serum lipid profile was determined by using Roche Diagnostics kits. The statistical analyses were performed using Statistica software package. In the comparison after vs. before the treatment period, in dyslipidemic women (<i>n</i> = 22), we observed significant decreases in <i>LINE-1</i> methylation levels (97.54 ± 1.50 vs. 98.39 ± 0.86%, respectively; <i>P</i> = 0.01) and arachidonic acid/eicosapentaenoic acid ratio [29.17 ± 15.21 vs. 38.42 (25.96-89.58), respectively; <i>P</i> = 0.02]. The change (after vs. before treatment) in <i>LINE-1</i> methylation directly correlated with the presence of <i>MTHFR</i> 677T allele, average daily folate intake, and the change in serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but inversely correlated with the change in serum triacylglycerols (<i>R</i> = 0.72, <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.52, adjusted <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.36, <i>P</i> = 0.03). The current results imply potential cardioprotective effects of habitual polyphenol-rich aronia juice consumption achieved through the modifications of DNA methylation pattern and PUFAs in subjects at CVD risk, which should be further confirmed. Hence, the precision nutrition-driven modulations of both DNA methylation and PUFA profile may become targets for new approaches in the prevention of CVD.",Stojković L; Zec M; Zivkovic M; Bundalo M; Bošković M; Glibetić M; Stankovic A,Frontiers in nutrition,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34222308/,0,0,0,0,0,0

34201625,Omega-3 Supplementation and Heart Disease: A Population-Based Diet by Gene Analysis of Clinical Trial Outcomes.,"Omega-3 (<i>n</i>-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and their metabolites have long been recognized to protect against inflammation-related diseases including heart disease. Recent reports present conflicting evidence on the effects of <i>n</i>-3 PUFAs on major cardiovascular events including death. While some studies document that <i>n</i>-3 PUFA supplementation reduces the risk for heart disease, others report no beneficial effects on heart disease composite primary outcomes. Much of this heterogeneity may be related to the genetic variation in different individuals/populations that alters their capacity to synthesize biologically active <i>n</i>-3 and omega 6 (<i>n</i>-6) PUFAs and metabolites from their 18 carbon dietary precursors, linoleic acid (LA, 18:2 <i>n</i>-6) and alpha-linolenic (ALA, 18:3, <i>n</i>-3). Here, we discuss the role of a <i>FADS</i> gene-by-dietary PUFA interaction model that takes into consideration dietary exposure, including the intake of LA and ALA, <i>n</i>-3 PUFAs, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in determining the efficacy of <i>n</i>-3 PUFA supplementation. We also review recent clinical trials with <i>n</i>-3 PUFA supplementation and coronary heart disease in the context of what is known about fatty acid desaturase (<i>FADS)</i> gene-by-dietary PUFA interactions. Given the dramatic differences in the frequencies of <i>FADS</i> variants that impact the efficiency of <i>n</i>-3 and <i>n</i>-6 PUFA biosynthesis, and their downstream signaling products among global and admixture populations, we conclude that large clinical trials utilizing ""one size fits all"" <i>n</i>-3 PUFA supplementation approaches are unlikely to show effectiveness. However, evidence discussed in this review suggests that <i>n</i>-3 PUFA supplementation may represent an important opportunity where precision interventions can be focused on those populations that will benefit the most from <i>n</i>-3 PUFA supplementation.",Fernandez ML; Blomquist SA; Hallmark B; Chilton FH,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34201625/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34167027,Loss of Selenov predisposes mice to extra fat accumulation and attenuated energy expenditure.,"Selenoprotein V (SELENOV) is a new and the least conserved member of the selenoprotein family. Herein we generated Selenov knockout (KO) mice to determine its in vivo function. The KO led to 16-19% increases (P < 0.05) in body weight that were largely due to 54% higher (P < 0.05) fat mass accumulation, compared with the wild-type (WT) controls. The extra fat accumulation in the KO mice was mediated by up-regulations of genes and proteins involved in lipogenesis (Acc, Fas, Dgat, and Lpl; up by 40%-1.1-fold) and down-regulations of lipolysis (Atgl, Hsl, Ces1d, and Cpt1a; down by 36-89%) in the adipose tissues. The KO also decreased (P < 0.05) VO<sub>2</sub> consumption (14-21%), VCO<sub>2</sub> production (14-16%), and energy expenditure (14-23%), compared with the WT controls. SELENOV and O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) exhibited a novel protein-protein interaction that explained the KO-induced decreases (P < 0.05) of OGT protein (15-29%), activity (33%), and function (O-GlcNAcylation, 10-21%) in the adipose tissues. A potential cascade of SELENOV-OGT-AMP-activated protein kinase might serve as a central mechanism to link the biochemical and molecular responses to the KO. Overall, our data revealed a novel in vivo function and mechanism of SELENOV as a new inhibitor of body fat accumulation, activator of energy expenditure, regulator of O-GlcNAcylation, and therapeutic target of such related disorders.",Chen LL; Huang JQ; Wu YY; Chen LB; Li SP; Zhang X; Wu S; Ren FZ; Lei XG,Redox biology,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34167027/,0,0,0,0,0,0
34155343,Msi1 promotes breast cancer metastasis by regulating invadopodia-mediated extracellular matrix degradation via the Timp3-Mmp9 pathway.,"Metastasis is the main cause of death in breast cancer patients. The initial step of metastasis is invadopodia-mediated extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, which enables local breast tumor cells to invade surrounding tissues. However, the molecular mechanism underlying invadopodia-mediated metastasis remains largely unknown. Here we found that the RNA-binding protein Musashi1 (Msi1) exhibited elevated expression in invasive breast tumors and promoted lung metastasis of mammary cancer cells. Suppression of Msi1 reduced invadopodia formation in mammary cancer cells. Furthermore, Msi1 deficiency decreased the expression and activity of Mmp9, an important enzyme in ECM degradation. Mechanistically, Msi1 directly suppressed Timp3, an endogenous inhibitor of Mmp9. In clinical breast cancer specimens, TIMP3 and MSI1 levels were significantly inversely correlated both in normal breast tissue and breast cancer tissues and associated with overall survival in breast cancer patients. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the MSI1-TIMP3-MMP9 cascade is critical for invadopodia-mediated onset of metastasis in breast cancer, providing novel insights into a promising therapeutic strategy for breast cancer metastasis.",Bi X; Lou P; Song Y; Sheng X; Liu R; Deng M; Yang X; Li G; Yuan S; Zhang H; Jiao B; Zhang B; Xue L; Liu Z; Plikus MV; Ren F; Gao S; Zhao L; Yu Z,Oncogene,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34155343/,0,0,0,0,0,0

This cross-sectional study was conducted in a sample of 236 participants with T2D (53.4% women, mean age 60 ± 10 years). DNA samples were genotyped for the rs7204609 polymorphism (C/T) in the FTO gene. Clinical, anthropometric, and metabolic data were collected. Path analysis was used to evaluate the associations. Of the sample, 78 individuals with T2D had CKD (33%). Presence of the risk allele (C) was higher among participants with CKD (21.8 vs. 10.8%; p = 0.023). This polymorphism was positively associated with higher waist circumference, which in turn was associated with higher glycated hemoglobin and higher blood pressure. A higher blood-pressure level was associated with higher urinary albumin excretion (UAE) and as expected, higher UAE was associated with CKD. Path analysis showed an indirect relationship between the FTO gene and early CKD, mediated by waist circumference, blood-pressure levels, and UAE. These findings suggest that the C allele may contribute to genetic susceptibility to CKD in individuals with T2D through the presence of central obesity, hypertension, and high albuminuria.",Marchetti J; Balbino KP; Hermsdorff HHM; Juvanhol LL; Martinez JA; Steemburgo T,Lifestyle genomics,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34134115/,0,0,0,0,0,0
34116483,Exploration of the potential roles of m6A regulators in the uterus in pregnancy and infertility.,"Infertility is a prevalent female reproductive disease worldwide. Currently, there are many unknown etiologies of infertility. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent modification of eukaryotic mRNA. This study intended to investigate the implications of m6A regulators in the uterus for pregnancy and infertility. Pregnant ICR mice on days (D) 0, 4, 6, 10, and 15 were used to monitor m6A methylation in the uterus by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and then m6A methylation regulators were detected by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC). We found that m6A levels increased and that m6A regulators were expressed differently in the uterus during pregnancy. Then, we acquired expression data from endometrial tissue from women with infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The expression of m6A regulators in infertility was significantly dysregulated according to the data mining technique. Specifically, the mRNA levels of METTL16 (p = 0.0147) and WTAP (p = 0.028) were lower and those of ALKBH5 (p = 0.0432) and IGF2BP2 (p = 0.0016) were higher in the endometrium of infertile patients. Meanwhile, many immunity-related pathways are abnormal in infertility, such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity and leukocyte transendothelial migration. In conclusion, we found that the m6A levels in the uterus increased as pregnancy progressed, and these regulators were dysregulated in the endometrium of infertility patients. These results suggest that m6A methylation may be very important in the establishment of implantation and maintenance of pregnancy and may become a new direction for research on infertility.",Zhao S; Lu J; Chen Y; Wang Z; Cao J; Dong Y,Journal of reproductive immunology,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34116483/,0,0,0,0,0,0
34102077,Genetics of Sleep and Insights into Its Relationship with Obesity.,"Considerable recent advancements in elucidating the genetic architecture of sleep traits and sleep disorders may provide insight into the relationship between sleep and obesity. Despite the involvement of the circadian clock in sleep and metabolism, few shared genes, including <i>FTO</i>, were implicated in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of sleep and obesity. Polygenic scores composed of signals from GWASs of sleep traits show largely null associations with obesity, suggesting lead variants are unique to sleep. Modest genome-wide genetic correlations are observed between many sleep traits and obesity and are largest for snoring. Notably, U-shaped positive genetic correlations with body mass index (BMI) exist for both short and long sleep durations. Findings from Mendelian randomization suggest robust causal effects of insomnia on higher BMI and, conversely, of higher BMI on snoring and daytime sleepiness. In addition, bidirectional effects between sleep duration and daytime napping with obesity may also exist. Limited gene-sleep interaction studies suggest that achieving favorable sleep, as part of a healthy lifestyle, may attenuate genetic predisposition to obesity,but whether these improvements produce clinically meaningful reductions in obesity risk remains unclear. Investigations of the genetic link between sleep and obesity for sleep disorders other than insomnia and in populations of non-European ancestry are currently limited.",Dashti HS; Ordovás JM,Annual review of nutrition,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34102077/,0,0,0,0,0,0
34063414,Oral Administration of Ginger-Derived Lipid Nanoparticles and Dmt1 siRNA Potentiates the Effect of Dietary Iron Restriction and Mitigates Pre-Existing Iron Overload in <i>Hamp</i> KO Mice.,"Intestinal iron transport requires an iron importer (Dmt1) and an iron exporter (Fpn1). The hormone hepcidin regulates iron absorption by modulating Fpn1 protein levels on the basolateral surface of duodenal enterocytes. In the genetic, iron-loading disorder hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), hepcidin production is low and Fpn1 protein expression is elevated. High Fpn1-mediated iron export depletes intracellular iron, causing a paradoxical increase in Dmt1-mediated iron import. Increased activity of both transporters causes excessive iron absorption, thus initiating body iron loading. Logically then, silencing of intestinal Dmt1 or Fpn1 could be an effective therapeutic intervention in HH. It was previously established that Dmt1 knock down prevented iron-loading in weanling <i>Hamp</i> (encoding hepcidin) KO mice (modeling type 2B HH). Here, we tested the hypothesis that Dmt1 silencing combined with dietary iron restriction (which may be recommended for HH patients) will mitigate iron loading once already established. Accordingly, adult <i>Hamp</i> KO mice were switched to a low-iron (LFe) diet and (non-toxic) folic acid-coupled, ginger nanoparticle-derived lipid vectors (FA-GDLVs) were used to deliver negative-control (NC) or Dmt1 siRNA by oral, intragastric gavage daily for 21 days. The LFe diet reduced body iron burden, and experimental interventions potentiated iron losses. For example, Dmt1 siRNA treatment suppressed duodenal Dmt1 mRNA expression (by ~50%) and reduced serum and liver non-heme iron levels (by ~60% and >85%, respectively). Interestingly, some iron-related parameters were repressed similarly by FA-GDLVs carrying either siRNA, including <sup>59</sup>Fe (as FeCl<sub>3</sub>) absorption (~20% lower), pancreatic non-heme iron (reduced by ~65%), and serum ferritin (decreased 40-50%). Ginger may thus contain bioactive lipids that also influence iron homeostasis. In conclusion, the combinatorial approach of FA-GDLV and Dmt1 siRNA treatment, with dietary iron restriction, mitigated pre-existing iron overload in a murine model of HH.",Wang X; Zhang M; Woloshun RR; Yu Y; Lee JK; Flores SRL; Merlin D; Collins JF,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34063414/,0,0,0,0,0,0
34062793,Dietary Selenium Regulates microRNAs in Metabolic Disease: Recent Progress.,"Selenium (Se) is an essential element for the maintenance of a healthy physiological state. However, due to environmental and dietary factors and the narrow safety range of Se, diseases caused by Se deficiency or excess have gained considerable traction in recent years. In particular, links have been identified between low Se status, cognitive decline, immune disorders, and increased mortality, whereas excess Se increases metabolic risk. Considerable evidence has suggested microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate interactions between the environment (including the diet) and genes, and play important roles in several diseases, including cancer. MiRNAs target messenger RNAs to induce changes in proteins including selenoprotein expression, ultimately generating disease. While a plethora of data exists on the epigenetic regulation of other dietary factors, nutrient Se epigenetics and especially miRNA regulated mechanisms remain unclear. Thus, this review mainly focuses on Se metabolism, pathogenic mechanisms, and miRNAs as key regulatory factors in Se-related diseases. Finally, we attempt to clarify the regulatory mechanisms underpinning Se, miRNAs, selenoproteins, and Se-related diseases.",Huang X; Dong YL; Li T; Xiong W; Zhang X; Wang PJ; Huang JQ,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34062793/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34039840,Recent advances in understanding the adaptive evolution of metabolic genes and traits.,"This review summarizes the recent advances in understanding the adaptive evolution of metabolic genes and traits, providing insights into gene-diet interactions in human evolution and health. The rapid accumulation of ancient DNA across time and geography illuminates unprecedented details of some well-established examples of genetic adaptation to diet, such as the LCT and FADS genes. Novel cases of thrifty genes were identified, especially a microRNA at the LCT locus that controls energy expenditure and glucose homeostasis, connecting the historical adaptation to present-day metabolic disorders. A new example of gene-diet-microbiota interactions was established among the AMY1 copy number, starchy diets, and resistant-starch-digesting Ruminococcus. The explosion of genome-wide association studies in large cohorts unravels the present-day health implications of historically adaptive genetic variants. It also enables studies into the polygenic adaptation of metabolic traits, revealing intriguing adaptive signals for increased bone mineral density, blood pressure, and risk of type 2 diabetes, but decreased body mass index and HbA1c. The rapid accumulation of ancient and modern DNA has fueled the characterization of novel and existing cases of genetic adaptation. However, transferring these evolutionary insights into genome-informed precision nutrition requires extensive mechanistic studies and genotype-aware clinical trials.",Yang S; Ye K,Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34039840/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33982113,Lactoferrin Is a Potential Activator of the Vitamin D Receptor in Its Regulation of Osteogenic Activities in C57BL/6J Mice and MC3T3-E1 Cells.,"Lactoferrin (LF) has been shown to promote bone anabolism, and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) mediates the effects of vitamin D on bone. We hypothesized that LF improves bone health by increasing VDR expression. We sought to determine the role of VDR activation in LF-induced osteogenic activity in vivo and in vitro and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Sixty male C57BL/6J mice (aged 4 wk) were randomly assigned into 6 groups and fed vitamin D-deficient (VDD; 0 IU/kg) or vitamin D-normal diet (VDN; 1000 IU cholecalciferol/kg) and administered placebo or LF (100 or 1000 mg/kg body weight) by gavage for 24 wk. Trabecular bone structure was analyzed using micro-CT, and VDR expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. In vitro, MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with 100 μg LF/mL to evaluate its effect on VDR expression. Finally, the direct recruitment of LF to the Vdr promoter was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. In addition, cells were transfected with pGL3-basic Vdr vector for monitoring Vdr promoter activation using luciferase assays. LF supplementation at 100 and 1000 mg/kg revealed an ∼6.5% (P < 0.05) increase in bone mineral density in mice on VDD diet and exhibited an enhanced expression of VDR in bone compared with control. This increased expression of VDR was also observed in the bone of mice on the VDN diet, but the effect was more pronounced in VDD diet. In vitro, compared with the control group, Vdr mRNA expression was 18 times greater (P < 0.05) and peaked at 2 h posttreatment of LF. By cotransfection of the pGL3-basic Vdr vector, LF induced luciferase activity by 30% (P < 0.05) in MC3T3-E1 cells. In vivo and in vitro, LF, a potential activator of VDR, promotes osteogenesis. This suggests that dairy products, which are rich in LF, may serve as a functional food to improve bone health.",Li Y; Huang J; Wang J; Ma M; Lu Y; Wang R; Guo H,The Journal of nutrition,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33982113/,0,0,0,0,0,0
33968075,Allyl Isothiocyanate: A TAS2R38 Receptor-Dependent Immune Modulator at the Interface Between Personalized Medicine and Nutrition.,"Understanding individual responses to nutrition and medicine is of growing interest and importance. There is evidence that differences in bitter taste receptor (TAS2R) genes which give rise to two frequent haplotypes, TAS2R38-PAV (functional) and TAS2R38-AVI (non-functional), may impact inter-individual differences in health status. We here analyzed the relevance of the TAS2R38 receptor in the regulation of the human immune response using the TAS2R38 agonist allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) from <i>Brassica</i> plants. A differential response in calcium mobilization upon AITC treatment in leucocytes from healthy humans confirmed a relevance of TAS2R38 functionality, independent from cation channel TRPV1 or TRPA1 activation. We further identified a TAS2R38-dependence of MAPK and AKT signaling activity, bactericidal (toxicity against <i>E. coli</i>) and anti-inflammatory activity (TNF-alpha inhibition upon cell stimulation). These <i>in vitro</i> results were derived at relevant human plasma levels in the low micro molar range as shown here in a human intervention trial with AITC-containing food.",Tran HTT; Stetter R; Herz C; Spöttel J; Krell M; Hanschen FS; Schreiner M; Rohn S; Behrens M; Lamy E,Frontiers in immunology,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33968075/,0,0,0,0,0,0
33953289,Mutational mechanisms shaping the coding and noncoding genome of germinal center derived B-cell lymphomas.,"B cells have the unique property to somatically alter their immunoglobulin (IG) genes by V(D)J recombination, somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class-switch recombination (CSR). Aberrant targeting of these mechanisms is implicated in lymphomagenesis, but the mutational processes are poorly understood. By performing whole genome and transcriptome sequencing of 181 germinal center derived B-cell lymphomas (gcBCL) we identified distinct mutational signatures linked to SHM and CSR. We show that not only SHM, but presumably also CSR causes off-target mutations in non-IG genes. Kataegis clusters with high mutational density mainly affected early replicating regions and were enriched for SHM- and CSR-mediated off-target mutations. Moreover, they often co-occurred in loci physically interacting in the nucleus, suggesting that mutation hotspots promote increased mutation targeting of spatially co-localized loci (termed hypermutation by proxy). Only around 1% of somatic small variants were in protein coding sequences, but in about half of the driver genes, a contribution of B-cell specific mutational processes to their mutations was found. The B-cell-specific mutational processes contribute to both lymphoma initiation and intratumoral heterogeneity. Overall, we demonstrate that mutational processes involved in the development of gcBCL are more complex than previously appreciated, and that B cell-specific mutational processes contribute via diverse mechanisms to lymphomagenesis.",Hübschmann D; Kleinheinz K; Wagener R; Bernhart SH; López C; Toprak UH; Sungalee S; Ishaque N; Kretzmer H; Kreuz M; Waszak SM; Paramasivam N; Ammerpohl O; Aukema SM; Beekman R; Bergmann AK; Bieg M; Binder H; Borkhardt A; Borst C; Brors B; Bruns P; Carrillo de Santa Pau E; Claviez A; Doose G; Haake A; Karsch D; Haas S; Hansmann ML; Hoell JI; Hovestadt V; Huang B; Hummel M; Jäger-Schmidt C; Kerssemakers JNA; Korbel JO; Kube D; Lawerenz C; Lenze D; Martens JHA; Ott G; Radlwimmer B; Reisinger E; Richter J; Rico D; Rosenstiel P; Rosenwald A; Schillhabel M; Stilgenbauer S; Stadler PF; Martín-Subero JI; Szczepanowski M; Warsow G; Weniger MA; Zapatka M; Valencia A; Stunnenberg HG; Lichter P; Möller P; Loeffler M; Eils R; Klapper W; Hoffmann S; Trümper L; Küppers R; Schlesner M; Siebert R,Leukemia,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33953289/,0,0,0,0,0,0
33921683,Precision Nutrition for Alzheimer's Prevention in <i>ApoE4</i> Carriers.,"The <i>ApoE4</i> allele is the most well-studied genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, a condition that is increasing in prevalence and remains without a cure. Precision nutrition targeting metabolic pathways altered by <i>ApoE4</i> provides a tool for the potential prevention of disease. However, no long-term human studies have been conducted to determine effective nutritional protocols for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease in <i>ApoE4</i> carriers. This may be because relatively little is yet known about the precise mechanisms by which the genetic variant confers an increased risk of dementia. Fortunately, recent research is beginning to shine a spotlight on these mechanisms. These new data open up the opportunity for speculation as to how carriers might ameliorate risk through lifestyle and nutrition. Herein, we review recent discoveries about how <i>ApoE4</i> differentially impacts microglia and inflammatory pathways, astrocytes and lipid metabolism, pericytes and blood-brain barrier integrity, and insulin resistance and glucose metabolism. We use these data as a basis to speculate a precision nutrition approach for <i>ApoE4</i> carriers, including a low-glycemic index diet with a ketogenic option, specific Mediterranean-style food choices, and a panel of seven nutritional supplements. Where possible, we integrate basic scientific mechanisms with human observational studies to create a more complete and convincing rationale for this precision nutrition approach. Until recent research discoveries can be translated into long-term human studies, a mechanism-informed practical clinical approach may be useful for clinicians and patients with <i>ApoE4</i> to adopt a lifestyle and nutrition plan geared towards Alzheimer's risk reduction.",Norwitz NG; Saif N; Ariza IE; Isaacson RS,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33921683/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33895792,RNF217 regulates iron homeostasis through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity by modulating ferroportin degradation.,"Ferroportin (FPN), the body's sole iron exporter, is essential for maintaining systemic iron homeostasis. In response to either increased iron or inflammation, hepatocyte-secreted hepcidin binds to FPN, inducing its internalization and subsequent degradation. However, the E3 ubiquitin ligase that underlies FPN degradation has not been identified. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a novel mechanism involving the RNF217-mediated degradation of FPN. A combination of 2 different E3 screens revealed that the Rnf217 gene is a target of Tet1, mediating the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of FPN. Interestingly, loss of Tet1 expression causes an accumulation of FPN and an impaired response to iron overload, manifested by increased iron accumulation in the liver together with decreased iron in the spleen and duodenum. Moreover, we found that the degradation and ubiquitination of FPN could be attenuated by mutating RNF217. Finally, using 2 conditional knockout mouse lines, we found that knocking out Rnf217 in macrophages increases splenic iron export by stabilizing FPN, whereas knocking out Rnf217 in intestinal cells appears to increase iron absorption. These findings suggest that the Tet1-RNF217-FPN axis regulates iron homeostasis, revealing new therapeutic targets for FPN-related diseases.",Jiang L; Wang J; Wang K; Wang H; Wu Q; Yang C; Yu Y; Ni P; Zhong Y; Song Z; Xie E; Hu R; Min J; Wang F,Blood,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33895792/,0,0,0,0,0,0
33876196,Polymorphisms in SLC44A1 are associated with cognitive improvement in children diagnosed with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder: an exploratory study of oral choline supplementation.,"The essential nutrient choline provides one-carbon units for metabolite synthesis and epigenetic regulation in tissues including brain. Dietary choline intake is often inadequate, and higher intakes are associated with improved cognitive function. Choline supplements confer cognitive improvement for those diagnosed with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), a common set of neurodevelopmental impairments; however, the effect sizes have been modest. In this retrospective analysis, we report that genetic polymorphisms affecting choline utilization are associated with cognitive improvement following choline intervention. Fifty-two children from the upper midwestern United States and diagnosed with FASD, ages 2-5 y, were randomly assigned to receive choline (500 mg/d; n = 26) or placebo (n = 26) for 9 mo, and were genotyped for 384 choline-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Memory and cognition were assessed at enrollment, study terminus, and at 4-y follow-up for a subset. When stratified by intervention (choline vs. placebo), 14-16 SNPs within the cellular choline transporter gene solute carrier family 44 member 1 (SLC44A1) were significantly associated with performance in an elicited imitation sequential memory task, wherein the effect alleles were associated with the greatest pre-/postintervention improvement. Of these, rs3199966 is a structural variant (S644A) and rs2771040 is a single-nucleotide variant within the 3' untranslated region of the plasma membrane isoform. An additive genetic model best explained the genotype associations. Lesser associations were observed for cognitive outcome and polymorphisms in flavin monooxygenase-3 (FMO3), methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase-1 (MTHFD1), fatty acid desaturase-2 (FADS2), and adiponectin receptor 1 (ADIPOR1). These SLC44A1 variants were previously associated with greater vulnerability to choline deficiency. Our data potentially support the use of choline supplements to improve cognitive function in individuals diagnosed with FASD who carry these effect alleles. Although these findings require replication in both retrospective and prospective confirmatory trials, they emphasize the need to incorporate similar genetic analyses of choline-related polymorphisms in other FASD-choline trials, and to test for similar associations within the general FASD population.

33864366,Genome-wide gene-diet interaction analysis in the UK Biobank identifies novel effects on hemoglobin A1c.,"Diet is a significant modifiable risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D), and its effect on disease risk is under partial genetic control. Identification of specific gene-diet interactions (GDIs) influencing risk biomarkers such as glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is a critical step towards precision nutrition for T2D prevention, but progress has been slow due to limitations in sample size and accuracy of dietary exposure measurement. We leveraged the large UK Biobank (UKB) cohort and a diverse group of dietary exposures, including 30 individual dietary traits and 8 empirical dietary patterns, to conduct genome-wide interaction studies in ~340 000 European-ancestry participants to identify novel GDIs influencing HbA1c. We identified five variant-dietary trait pairs reaching genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10-8): two involved dietary patterns (meat pattern with rs147678157 and a fruit & vegetable-based pattern with rs3010439) and three involved individual dietary traits (bread consumption with rs62218803, dried fruit consumption with rs140270534 and milk type [dairy vs. other] with 4:131148078_TAGAA_T). These were affected minimally by adjustment for geographical and lifestyle-related confounders, and four of the five variants lacked genetic main effects that would have allowed their detection in a traditional genome-wide association study for HbA1c. Notably, multiple loci near transient receptor potential subfamily M genes (TRPM2 and TRPM3) interacted with carbohydrate-containing food groups. These interactions were further characterized using non-European UKB subsets and alternative measures of glycaemia (fasting glucose and follow-up HbA1c measurements).

This information may be translated into the implementation of personalized nutrition approaches involving precision nutrigenetic and nutrigenomic strategies for obesity monitoring and weight management. The importance and influence of several nongenetic contributors to obesity onset and individual responses to weight-loss interventions have been highlighted including the role of age, sex or perinatal feeding and others related to an individual's lifestyle and modifiable. Nutrigenetic studies have analysed potential interactions between polymorphisms influencing energy homeostasis/body composition and dietary factors in relation to adiposity phenotypes and therapy responsiveness. A second approach comprises the Nutrigenomic analysis of gene expression modifications in response to the consumption of specific nutrients or dietary bioactive compounds, which may involve epigenetic mechanisms including deoxyribonucleic acid methylation and micro-ribonucleic acid expression profiles.

33849843,Leveraging Genomic Associations in Precision Digital Care for Weight Loss: Cohort Study.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgency of addressing an epidemic of obesity and associated inflammatory illnesses. Previous studies have demonstrated that interactions between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and lifestyle interventions such as food and exercise may vary metabolic outcomes, contributing to obesity. However, there is a paucity of research relating outcomes from digital therapeutics to the inclusion of genetic data in care interventions. This study aims to describe and model the weight loss of participants enrolled in a precision digital weight loss program informed by the machine learning analysis of their data, including genomic data. It was hypothesized that weight loss models would exhibit a better fit when incorporating genomic data versus demographic and engagement variables alone. A cohort of 393 participants enrolled in Digbi Health's personalized digital care program for 120 days was analyzed retrospectively. The care protocol used participant data to inform precision coaching by mobile app and personal coach. Linear regression models were fit of weight loss (pounds lost and percentage lost) as a function of demographic and behavioral engagement variables. Genomic-enhanced models were built by adding 197 SNPs from participant genomic data as predictors and refitted using Lasso regression on SNPs for variable selection. Success or failure logistic regression models were also fit with and without genomic data. Overall, 72.0% (n=283) of the 393 participants in this cohort lost weight, whereas 17.3% (n=68) maintained stable weight. A total of 142 participants lost 5% bodyweight within 120 days. Models described the impact of demographic and clinical factors, behavioral engagement, and genomic risk on weight loss. Incorporating genomic predictors improved the mean squared error of weight loss models (pounds lost and percent) from 70 to 60 and 16 to 13, respectively. The logistic model improved the pseudo R<sup>2</sup> value from 0.193 to 0.285. Gender, engagement, and specific SNPs were significantly associated with weight loss. SNPs within genes involved in metabolic pathways processing food and regulating fat storage were associated with weight loss in this cohort: rs17300539_G (insulin resistance and monounsaturated fat metabolism), rs2016520_C (BMI, waist circumference, and cholesterol metabolism), and rs4074995_A (calcium-potassium transport and serum calcium levels). The models described greater average weight loss for participants with more risk alleles. Notably, coaching for dietary modification was personalized to these genetic risks. Including genomic information when modeling outcomes of a digital precision weight loss program greatly enhanced the model accuracy. Interpretable weight loss models indicated the efficacy of coaching informed by participants' genomic risk, accompanied by active engagement of participants in their own success. Although large-scale validation is needed, our study preliminarily supports precision dietary interventions for weight loss using genetic risk, with digitally delivered recommendations alongside health coaching to improve intervention efficacy.",Sinha R; Kachru D; Ricchetti RR; Singh-Rambiritch S; Muthukumar KM; Singaravel V; Irudayanathan C; Reddy-Sinha C; Junaid I; Sharma G; Francis-Lyon PA,Journal of medical Internet research,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33849843/,0,0,0,0,0,0
33802173,Natural Extracts to Augment Energy Expenditure as a Complementary Approach to Tackle Obesity and Associated Metabolic Alterations.,"Obesity is the epidemic of the 21st century. In developing countries, the prevalence of obesity continues to rise, and obesity is occurring at younger ages. Obesity and associated metabolic stress disrupt the whole-body physiology. Adipocytes are critical components of the systemic metabolic control, functioning as an endocrine organ. The enlarged adipocytes during obesity recruit macrophages promoting chronic inflammation and insulin resistance. Together with the genetic susceptibility (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNP) and metabolic alterations at the molecular level, it has been highlighted that key modifiable risk factors, such as those related to lifestyle, contribute to the development of obesity. In this scenario, urgent therapeutic options are needed, including not only pharmacotherapy but also nutrients, bioactive compounds, and natural extracts to reverse the metabolic alterations associated with obesity. Herein, we first summarize the main targetable processes to tackle obesity, including activation of thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and in white adipose tissue (WAT-browning), and the promotion of energy expenditure and/or fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in muscles. Then, we perform a screening of 20 natural extracts (EFSA approved) to determine their potential in the activation of FAO and/or thermogenesis, as well as the increase in respiratory capacity. By means of innovative technologies, such as the study of their effects on cell bioenergetics (Seahorse bioanalyzer), we end up with the selection of four extracts with potential application to ameliorate the deleterious effects of obesity and the chronic associated inflammation.",Reguero M; Gómez de Cedrón M; Reglero G; Quintela JC; Ramírez de Molina A,Biomolecules,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33802173/,0,0,0,0,0,0
33794384,"Polyunsaturated fatty acids, specialized pro-resolving mediators, and targeting inflammation resolution in the age of precision nutrition.","Chronic inflammation contributes toward the pathogenesis of numerous diseases including, but not limited to, obesity, autoimmunity, cardiovascular diseases, and cancers. The discovery of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), which are critical for resolving inflammation, has commenced investigation into targeting pathways of inflammation resolution to improve physiological outcomes. SPMs are predominately synthesized from the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids. Therefore, one viable strategy to promote inflammation resolution would be to increase dietary intake of EPA/DHA, which are deficient in select populations. However, there are inconsistencies between the use of EPA/DHA as dietary or pharmacological supplements and improved inflammatory status. Herein, we review the literature on the relationship between the high n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio, downstream SPM biosynthesis, and inflammatory endpoints. We highlight key studies that have investigated how dietary intake of EPA/DHA increase tissue SPMs and their effects on inflammation. We also discuss the biochemical pathways by which EPA/DHA drive SPM biosynthesis and underscore mechanistic gaps in knowledge about these pathways which include a neglect for host genetics/ethnic differences in SPM metabolism, sexual dimorphism in SPM levels, and potential competition from select dietary n-6 PUFAs for enzymes of SPM synthesis. Altogether, establishing how dietary PUFAs control SPM biosynthesis in a genetic- and sex-dependent manner will drive new precision nutrition studies with EPA/DHA to prevent chronic inflammation in select populations.",Al-Shaer AE; Buddenbaum N; Shaikh SR,Biochimica et biophysica acta.

33749945,Supplementation of milk polar lipids to obese dams improves neurodevelopment and cognitive function in male offspring.,"Milk contains about 4% fat globules with its surface covered by polar lipids. Despite the abundant consumption of dairy products, the biological effects of dietary milk polar lipids on metabolic health have only been sparsely examined. Maternal obesity results in neurodevelopmental disorders and cognitive impairment in offspring. Considering the importance of maternal nutrition, the effects of polar lipids-enriched milk fat globule membrane (MFGM-PL) supplementation to dams during pregnancy and lactation on neurodevelopment and its long-term programming effects on offspring cognition were examined. Female Sprague-Dawley rats consumed 8-week control diet (CON) or high-fat diet (HFD) to induce obesity before mating. Then, female rats were fed CON or HFD with or without the supplementation of 400 mg/kg body weight MFGM-PL during pregnancy and lactation. The offspring were fed 11-week HFD after weaning. MFGM-PL supplementation to obese dams suppressed body weight gain and hyperinsulinemia in both dams and offspring. Offspring born to obese dams displayed delayed neurological reflexes development, impaired neurogenesis before weaning, and cognitive impairment in adulthood, which were recovered by maternal MFGM-PL supplementation. Insulin resistance and aberrant brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling were induced in the hippocampus of neonatal and adult offspring due to maternal and progeny HFD, but recovered by maternal MFGM-PL administration. This study demonstrates that maternal MFGM-PL supplementation can promote neurodevelopment and exert long-term effects against HFD-induced cognitive impairment in offspring via alleviating hippocampal insulin resistance. Hence, MFGM-PL is a promising ingredient for exerting beneficial programming effects on the brain health of offspring.",Yuan QC; Gong H; Du M; Mao XY,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33749945/,0,0,0,0,0,0
33737614,Optimum protein requirement of juvenile orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides).,"The purpose of subject was to explore the optimum protein requirement of juvenile grouper (Epinephelus coioides). In the test, 450 juveniles with an average weight (10.02 ± 0.22) g were randomly divided into six groups with triplicate, and were fed with 350, 400, 450, 500, 550 and 600 g/kg iso-lipid test diet twice 1 day for 8 weeks, respectively. The results showed that: (1) With the increase of protein level, the body weight gain rate and specific growth rate first increased and then reduced, while the feed coefficient rate first decreased and then increased, while the protein efficiency significantly decreased (P < 0.05). (2) With the increase of protein level, the condition factor, hepaticsomatic index and visceralsomatic index significantly reduced (P < 0.05). (3) With the increase of protein level, the crude protein content of whole fish and muscle gradually increased, while the crude lipid content gradually decreased. (4) High-protein diet (550-600 g/kg) significantly increased the plasma total protein content and decreased the triglyceride content of orange-spotted grouper (P < 0.05). (5) Compared with the 350 g/kg group, 500, 550, 600 g/kg groups significantly increased the activities of glutamic-pyruvic transaminase and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase in liver (P < 0.05). (6) With the increase of protein level, the protease activity of intestine first increased and then decreased, and reached the maximum at the protein level of 500 g/kg, while lipase and amylase decreased significantly (P < 0.05). (7) The activities of acid phosphatase, superoxide dismutase and lysozyme in liver increased first and then decreased with the increase of protein level, and reached the maximum in the 400 g/kg protein group. According to the analysis specific growth rate, the optimum protein level of juvenile orange-spotted grouper is 521.84 g/kg.",Yan X; Yang J; Dong X; Tan B; Zhang S; Chi S; Liu H; Yang Y,Scientific reports,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33737614/,0,0,0,0,0,0
33723359,Sex-specific genetic architecture in response to American and ketogenic diets.,"There is a growing appreciation for individual responses to diet. In a previous study, mouse strain-specific responses to American and ketogenic diets were observed. In this study, we searched for genetic variants underlying differences in the responses to American and ketogenic diets between C57BL/6J (B6) and FVB/NJ (FVB) mouse strains. Genetic mapping of fat and lean mass gain revealed QTLs on Chromosome (Chr) 1 at 191.6 Mb (Fmgq1) (P < 0.001, CI = 180.2-194.4 Mb), Chr5 at 73.7 Mb (Fmgq2, Lmgq1) (P < 0.001, CI = 66.1-76.6 Mb), and Chr7 at 40.5 Mb (Fmgq3) (P < 0.01, CI = 36.6-44.5 Mb). Analysis of serum HDL cholesterol concentration identified a significant (P < 0.001, CI = 160.6-176.1 Mb) QTL on Chr1 at 168.6 Mb (Hdlq1). Causal network inference suggests that HDL cholesterol and fat mass gain are both linked to Fmgq1. Strong sex effects were identified at both Fmgq2 and Lmgq1, which are also diet-dependent. Interestingly, Fmgq2 and Fmgq3 affect fat gain directly, while Fmgq1 influences fat gain directly and via an intermediate change in serum cholesterol. These results demonstrate how precision nutrition will be advanced through the integration of genetic variation and sex in physiological responses to diets varied in carbohydrate composition.",Salvador AC; Arends D; Barrington WT; Elsaadi AM; Brockmann GA; Threadgill DW,International journal of obesity (2005),2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33723359/,0,0,0,0,0,0

The abundance and metabolite concentration of Propionibacterium increased rapidly in the early stage of fermentation. In the middle stage, the abundance of Lactobacillus began to increase, while the pH decreased rapidly. In the late stage, the concentration of PA began to decrease, but it remained at a high level at the end of fermentation. Correlation analysis showed that Lactobacillus and Bacillus had a strong negative correlation with PA and its precursor. The results showed that Fusobacterium, Providencia, Lactobacillus and Bacillus could be the key factors to reduce the PA content.

33712219,Evaluation of physiological and molecular responses to acute heat stress in two chicken breeds.,"High environmental temperatures are a foremost concern affecting poultry production; thus, understanding and controlling such conditions are vital to successful production and welfare of poultry. In view of this, a completely randomized design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement involving two local strains (Kirin chicken (KC) and Three-yellow chicken (TYC)) and two temperature groups (normal/control = 30 ± 2 °C and acute heat stress (AHS) = 35 ± 1 °C for 8-h with 70% humidity) was used to assess the main regulatory factors such as heat shock protein (HSP70) gene, cytokine genes (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10), muscle development gene (IGF-1) and tissue histopathological changes. At 56 days old, the temperatures of the comb (CT), feet (FT), eyelid (ET) and rectal (RT) from each group were taken thrice at 0, 2, 4 and 8-h during AHS, and 1 and 3-h recovery period after AHS. At 80 days old, the slaughter weight was also analyzed. The CT and ET of the AHS groups increased during the 8-h trial, while the RT of both strains decreased significantly at 4 h but increased at 8 h in the TYC group. All temperature recordings dropped in the AHS groups of both strains during the recovery period. The results revealed that the mRNA expression of HSP70 in the liver was higher in the heat-stressed group of both strains compared to the control. The expression of HSP70 was shown in the AHS-KC group to be significantly high compared to the control (P < 0.05). Moreover, the IGF1 gene in the liver, breast muscle and leg muscle was downregulated in the AHS-TYC group compared to the control (P < 0.05), although that in the AHS-KC was downregulated in the breast muscle. The mRNA expression of spleen IL-1β significantly decreased in the AHS-TYC group (P < 0.01), whereas that of the AHS-KC had no significant difference (P > 0.05). The mRNA expression of spleen IL-6 and IL-10 was increased in the AHS-KC group but did not exhibit obvious changes in the AHS-TYC. Correspondingly, the histopathological examinations revealed tissue injury in the AHS groups of both strains, with the TYC strain experiencing more severe changes. The final live and carcass weights showed a significant enhancement in the treatments (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively) and treatment×strain interaction (P < 0.05) with breast muscle rate significantly reducing among the treatments (P < 0.01) at 80 days. In conclusion, the differential response to AHS after physiological, molecular and immune response portrays KC to have better thermal tolerance than the TYC.",Adu-Asiamah P; Zhang Y; Amoah K; Leng QY; Zheng JH; Yang H; Zhang WL; Zhang L,Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33712219/,0,0,0,0,0,0
33693782,Anthropometric Variables as Mediators of the Association of Changes in Diet and Physical Activity With Inflammatory Profile.,"Mechanisms underlying the associations of high levels of physical activity (PA) and adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) with a better inflammatory profile remain unclear. Our objective was to assess the mediating role of changes in body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC), as markers of body fat in the association of changes in PA and adherence to the MedDiet, with changes in the inflammatory profile. This study included 489 adults, aged 55-75 years, from the PREDIMED-Plus multicenter lifestyle intervention trial. An inflammatory score was calculated, based on 8 blood biomarkers: high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, interleukin 18, monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1, C-peptide, leptin, and regulated on activation, normal T-cell-expressed and secreted chemokine. Biomarkers, levels of PA, score of MedDiet adherence, BMI, and WC were measured at baseline and at 1-year follow-up. Linear regression models were fitted according to the Baron and Kenny framework for mediation analysis. Changes in BMI and WC mediated the association of both changes in PA and changes in the MedDiet adherence with the inflammatory score. Body mass index mediated 26% of the association of changes in total PA with the inflammatory profile, and 27% of the association of changes in the MedDiet, while WC mediated 13% and 12% of these associations, respectively. In older adults at high cardiovascular risk, increasing PA levels and adherence to a MedDiet during 1 year were associated with a lower inflammatory score, which was partly mediated by a reduction in body fat.

Current microbiome studies generate high-throughput omics data across different body sites, populations, and life stages. Many of the challenges in microbiome research are similar to other high-throughput studies, the quantitative analyses need to address the heterogeneity of data, specific statistical properties, and the remarkable variation in microbiome composition across individuals and body sites. This has led to a broad spectrum of statistical and machine learning challenges that range from study design, data processing, and standardization to analysis, modeling, cross-study comparison, prediction, data science ecosystems, and reproducible reporting. Nevertheless, although many statistics and machine learning approaches and tools have been developed, new techniques are needed to deal with emerging applications and the vast heterogeneity of microbiome data. We review and discuss emerging applications of statistical and machine learning techniques in human microbiome studies and introduce the COST Action CA18131 ""ML4Microbiome"" that brings together microbiome researchers and machine learning experts to address current challenges such as standardization of analysis pipelines for reproducibility of data analysis results, benchmarking, improvement, or development of existing and new tools and ontologies.",Moreno-Indias I; Lahti L; Nedyalkova M; Elbere I; Roshchupkin G; Adilovic M; Aydemir O; Bakir-Gungor B; Santa Pau EC; D'Elia D; Desai MS; Falquet L; Gundogdu A; Hron K; Klammsteiner T; Lopes MB; Marcos-Zambrano LJ; Marques C; Mason M; May P; Pašić L; Pio G; Pongor S; Promponas VJ; Przymus P; Saez-Rodriguez J; Sampri A; Shigdel R; Stres B; Suharoschi R; Truu J; Truică CO; Vilne B; Vlachakis D; Yilmaz E; Zeller G; Zomer AL; Gómez-Cabrero D; Claesson MJ,Frontiers in microbiology,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33692771/,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, the regulatory mechanism underlying miRNA-mediated energy metabolism in BAT is not fully understood. Here, we explored the roles of miR-22 in BAT thermogenesis and energy metabolism. <b>Methods:</b> Using global and conditional knockout mice as <i>in vivo</i> models and primary brown adipocytes as an <i>in vitro</i> system, we investigated the function of miR-22 in BAT thermogenesis <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. <b>Results:</b> miR-22 expression was upregulated in BAT in response to cold exposure and during brown preadipocyte differentiation. Both global and conditional knockout mice displayed BAT whitening, impaired cold tolerance, and decreased BAT thermogenesis. Moreover, we found that miR-22 deficiency impaired BAT glycolytic capacity, which is critical for thermogenesis. The mechanistic results revealed that miR-22 activated the mTORC1 signaling pathway by directly suppressing Tsc1 and concomitantly directly suppressing Hif1an, an inhibitor of Hif1α, which promotes glycolysis and maintains thermogenesis. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our findings identify miR-22 as a critical regulator in the control of thermogenesis in BAT and as a potential therapeutic target for human metabolic disorders.",Lou P; Bi X; Tian Y; Li G; Kang Q; Lv C; Song Y; Xu J; Sheng X; Yang X; Liu R; Meng Q; Ren F; Plikus MV; Liang B; Zhang B; Guo H; Yu Z,Theranostics,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33664851/,0,0,0,0,0,0
33577842,"The T cell factor, pangolin, from Litopenaeus vannamei play a positive role in the immune responses against white spot syndrome virus infection.","As a downstream interactor of β-catenin, Pangolin which is the homologous protein of the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) in vertebrates is less understood in the research field of immunity. In this study, two isoforms of Litopenaeus vannamei Pangolin (LvPangolin1 and LvPangolin2) were identified. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that all of the Pangolin proteins from invertebrates were represented the same lineage. The mRNA expression profiles of the LvPangolin1 and LvPangolin2 genes differed across different tissues. The expression of LvPangolin1 and the amount of LvPangolin1and LvPangolin2 combined (LvPangolinComb) were significantly increased in the haemocyte, intestine and gill but reduced in the hepatopancreas after white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) challenge. The inhibition of LvPangolin1 but not LvPangolinComb significantly reduced the survival rates of L. vannamei after WSSV infection, while significantly higher WSSV viral loads in both LvPangolin1-inhibited and LvPangolinComb-inhibited L. vannamei were observed. Knockdown of LvPangolin by RNAi could distinctly decrease the expression of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes and their related transcription factors. All of these results indicate that LvPangolin plays a positive role in the response to WSSV infection and that this may be mediated through regulating the immune signalling pathways which control the expression of AMPs with antiviral abilities.",Zhu L; Zhang S; Hou C; Liang X; Saif Dehwah MA; Tan B; Shi L,Developmental and comparative immunology,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33577842/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Here, we demonstrate that a healthy Mediterranean-style dietary pattern is associated with specific functional and taxonomic components of the gut microbiome, and that its protective associations with cardiometabolic health vary depending on microbial composition. In particular, the protective association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and cardiometabolic disease risk was significantly stronger among participants with decreased abundance of Prevotella copri.

33551236,"The need for precision nutrition, genetic variation and resolution in Covid-19 patients.","The health of the individual and the population in general is the result of interaction between genetics and various environmental factors, of which diet/nutrition is the most important. The focus of this paper is on the association of high n-6 PUFA or low n-3 PUFA due to genetic variation and/or dietary intake, with changes in specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), cytokine storm, inflammation-resolution and Covid-19. Human beings evolved on a diet that was balanced in the n-6 and n-3 essential fatty acids with a ratio of n-6/n-3 of 1-2/1 whereas today this ratio is 16/1. Such a high ratio due to high amounts of n-6 fatty acids leads to a prothrombotic and proinflammatory state and is associated with obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some forms of cancer. In addition to the high intake of n-6 fatty acids that increases inflammation there is genetic variation in the biosynthesis of n-6 linoleic acid (LA) to arachidonic acid (ARA) and of linolenic (ALA) to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Present day humans have two common FADS haplotypes that differ dramatically in their ability to generate long-chain fatty acids. The more efficient, evolutionary derived haplotype increases the efficiency of synthesizing essential long-chain fatty acids from precursors and could have provided an advantage in environments with limited access to dietary long-chain fatty acids ARA, EPA and DHA. In the modern world this haplotype has been associated with lifestyle-related diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, all of which are characterized by increased levels of inflammation. African Americans and Latino populations have increased susceptibility and higher death rates from SARS-CoV-2 than whites. These populations are characterized by increased numbers of persons (about 80%) that are fast metabolizers, leading to increased production of ARA, as well as poor intake of fruits and vegetables. The combinations of fast metabolism and high n-6 intake increases their inflammatory status and possibly susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2. In vitro and human studies indicate that the specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPM) produced from the n-3, EPA and DHA influence the resolution of inflammation, allowing the tissues to return to function and homeostasis. The SPMs each counter-regulate cytokine storms, as well as proinflammatory lipid mediators via NFκB and inflammasome down regulation and reduce the proinflammatory eicosanoids produced from ARA. The nutritional availability of dietary n-3 fatty acids from marine oils enriched with SPM intermediate precursors, along with increasing local biosynthesis of SPMs to functional concentrations may be an approach of value during SARS-CoV2 infections, as well as in prevention, and shortening their recovery from infections. It is evident that populations differ in their genetic variants and their frequencies and their interactions with the food they eat. Gene-nutrient interactions is a very important area of study that provides specific dietary advice for individuals and subgroups within a population in the form of Precision Nutrition. Nutritional science needs to focus on Precision Nutrition, genetic variants in the population and a food supply composed of Nutrients that have been part of our diet throughout evolution, which is the diet that our genes are programmed to respond.",Simopoulos AP; Serhan CN; Bazinet RP,Molecular aspects of medicine,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33551236/,0,0,0,0,0,0
33530084,"Genetic Variation, Diet, Inflammation, and the Risk for COVID-19.","COVID-19, which is caused by SARS-CoV-2, is characterized by various symptoms, ranging from mild fatigue to life-threatening pneumonia, ""cytokine storm,"" and multiorgan failure. The manifestation of COVID-19 may lead to a cytokine storm, i.e., it facilitates viral replication that triggers a strong release of cytokines, which then modulates the immune system and results in hyperinflammation. Today's diet is high in omega-6 fatty acids and deficient in omega-3 fatty acids; this, along with a high fructose intake, leads to obesity, which is a chronic state of low-grade inflammation. Omega-6 fatty acids are proinflammatory and prothrombotic whereas omega-3 fatty acids are less proinflammatory and thrombotic. Furthermore, omega-3 fatty acids make specialized lipid mediators, namely resolvins, protectins, and maresins, that are potent anti-inflammatory agents. Throughout evolution there was a balance between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids with a ratio of 1-2/1 omega-6/omega-3, but today this ratio is 16-20/1 omega-6/omega-3, leading to a proinflammatory state. In addition, genetic variants in FADS1, FADS2, ELOV-2, and ELOV-5 lead to a more efficient biosynthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), e.g., of linoleic acid (LA) to arachidonic acid (ARA), and (alpha-linolenic acid) (ALA) to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), leading to higher ARA levels. Because the US diet is already high in omega-6 fatty acids, the increased biosynthesis of ARA in people with the derived FADS haplotype (haplotype D) leads to an increased production of leukotrienes, thromboxanes, C-reactive protein (CRP), and eventually elevated levels of cytokines, like interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which may increase susceptibility to COVID-19. About 80% of African Americans, 50% of Hispanics, and 45% of European Americans have the FADS haplotype D and are thus efficient metabolizers, which could account for the higher vulnerability of these populations to COVID-19. Therefore, another reason that African Americans and Hispanics are more susceptible to COVID-19 is that they have a higher frequency of haplotype D, which is no longer beneficial in today's environment and diet. Genetic variation must be considered in all studies of disease development and therapy because it is important to the practice of precision nutrition by physicians and other health professionals. The objective of this commentary is to emphasize the importance of genetic variation within populations and its interaction with diet in the development of disease. Differences in the frequency of genes and their interactions with nutrients in various population groups must be considered among the factors contributing to health disparities in the development of COVID-19. A balanced omega-6/omega-3 ratio is essential to health. Physicians should measure their patients' fatty acids and recommend decreasing the intake of foods rich in omega-6 fatty acids and increasing the intake of omega-3 fatty acids along with fruits and vegetables.",Simopoulos AP,Lifestyle genomics,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33530084/,0,0,0,0,0,0
33461193,Gene-Centric Database Reveals Environmental and Lifestyle Relationships for Potential Risk Modification and Prevention.,"The database at Nutrigenetics.net has been under development since 2007 to facilitate the identification and classification of PubMed articles relevant to human genetics. A controlled vocabulary (i.e., standardized terminology) is used to index these records, with links back to PubMed for every article title. This enables the display of indexes (alphabetical subtopic listings) for any given topic, or for any given combination of topics, including for genes and specific genetic variants. Stepwise use of such indexes (first for one topic, then for combinations of topics) can reveal relationships that are otherwise easily overlooked. These relationships include environmental and lifestyle variables with potential relevance to risk modification (both beneficial and detrimental), and to prevention, or at least to the potential delay of symptom onset for health conditions like Alzheimer disease among many others. Thirty-four specific genetic variants have each been mentioned in at least ≥1,000 PubMed titles/abstracts, and these numbers are steadily increasing. The benefits of indexing with standardized terminology are illustrated for genetic variants like MTHFR 677C-T and its various synonyms (e.g., rs1801133 or Ala222Val). Such use of a controlled vocabulary is also helpful for numerous health conditions, and for potential risk modifiers (i.e., potential risk/effect modifiers).",Martin RL,Lifestyle genomics,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33461193/,1,0,0,0,0,0

This identified the most promising drug candidates that can be potentially ""repurposed"" against COVID-19 including common drugs used to combat cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, such as simvastatin, atorvastatin and metformin.

33378763,Lentinan Inhibited the Activation of Th2 Cells in Allergic Mice by Reducing the Amplitude of Changes in Biological Rhythm.,"Biological rhythm is inextricably linked to the physiological mechanisms of allergic diseases, but the exact mechanisms are still poorly understood. Clinical studies have reported rhythmic fluctuations in allergic diseases. The search for natural and harmless active ingredients based on biological rhythm with which to regulate allergic diseases is essential for the control of food allergy. In this study, mice were treated at different time points to determine the link between the severity of allergic reactions and the circadian clock genes. The mice were treated with lentinan, either continuously or discontinuously, to assess their clinical symptoms, vascular permeability, immune cells, cytokines, and clock genes. Specifically, rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells were treated with lentinan and the rhythmic changes of cell degranulation were measured. The results in different models showed that the allergic reactions in mice treated at different time points were significantly different and thus related to fluctuations in biological rhythm. Treatment with lentinan was found to reduce the amplitude of changes in the clock genes, such as the activation of Per and Cry proteins in allergic mice, as well as to regulate biological rhythm in cells, inhibit the activation of Th2 cells, and alleviate allergic reactions. Furthermore, lentinan changed the rhythm of degranulation in RBL-2H3 cells. Lentinan was, therefore, determined to successfully alleviate allergic reactions by reducing the amplitude of changes in the body's biological rhythm, inhibiting the activation of Th2 cells, and affecting the immune microenvironment.",Yang S; Chew H; Jiang Y; Cheng L; Guo X; Che H; Sun N,International archives of allergy and immunology,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33378763/,0,0,0,0,0,0

We aimed to validate the association of rs67839313 with T2DM and explore interactive associations of INAFM2 rs67839313 and egg consumption with T2DM and fasting blood glucose (FBG) in a Chinese population. In total, 7175 participants (4202 T2DM cases) from 3980 families were included and categorized into two groups (<4 and ≥4 eggs/week) according to the median egg consumption. Multilevel logistic regression and linear regression models were performed to estimate the genetic associations of rs67839313 with T2DM and FBG, respectively. The crossproduct term between the variant and egg was included in the models for interaction analysis. We found that rs67839313_T was associated with an increased risk of T2DM (1.22 [95% CI: 1.17-1.27], P < 0.001). Among individuals with the rs67839313_T genotype, those with egg consumption <4/week (1.37 [1.25-1.51]) had a higher T2DM risk than those with egg consumption ≥4/week (1.17 [1.11-1.23]). A significant interactive effect between rs67839313_T and egg consumption on T2DM risk was identified (P = 0.008). Moreover, among participants without T2DM, rs67839313_T was associated with FBG, with a 0.188 mmol/l increase and a 0.152 mmol/l decrease among those consuming <4 eggs/week and ≥4 eggs/week, respectively. The interaction between rs67839313_T and egg consumption was observed to be significantly associated with FBG (P = 0.003). INAFM2 rs67839313_T was associated with increased T2DM risk and FBG levels in Chinese individuals, and consuming more eggs may eliminate the associated genetic risk.

33324423,GSK3β Plays a Negative Role During White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV) Infection by Regulating NF-κB Activity in Shrimp <i>Litopenaeus vannamei</i>.,"Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), a cytoplasmic serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in a large number of key cellular processes, is a little-known signaling molecule in virus study. In this study, a GSK3 protein which was highly similar to GSK3β homologs from other species in <i>Litopenaeus vannamei</i> (designated as LvGSK3β) was obtained. LvGSK3β was expressed constitutively in the healthy <i>L. vannamei</i>, at the highest level in the intestine and the lowest level in the eyestalk. White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) reduced LvGSK3β expression was in immune tissues including the hemocyte, intestine, gill and hepatopancreas. The inhibition of LvGSK3β resulted in significantly higher survival rates of <i>L. vannamei</i> during WSSV infection than the control group, and significantly lower WSSV viral loads in LvGSK3β-inhibited <i>L. vannamei</i> were observed. Knockdown of LvGSK3β by RNAi resulted in increases in the expression of LvDorsal and several NF-κB driven antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes (including ALF, PEN and crustin), but a decrease in LvCactus expression. Accordingly, overexpression of LvGSK3β could reduce the promoter activity of LvDorsal and several AMPs, while the promoter activity of LvCactus was increased. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) showed that LvDorsal could bind to the promoter of LvGSK3β. The interaction between LvGSK3β and LvDorsal or LvCactus was confirmed using co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays. In addition, the expression of LvGSK3β was dramatically reduced by knockdown of LvDorsal. In summary, the results presented in this study indicated that LvGSK3β had a negative effect on <i>L. vannamei</i> by mediating a feedback regulation of the NF-κB pathway when it is infected by WSSV.",Zhang S; Zhu L; Hou C; Yuan H; Yang S; Dehwah MAS; Shi L,Frontiers in immunology,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33324423/,0,0,0,0,0,0
33298924,NQO1 protects obese mice through improvements in glucose and lipid metabolism.,"Chronic nutrient excess leads to metabolic disorders and insulin resistance. Activation of stress-responsive pathways via Nrf2 activation contributes to energy metabolism regulation. Here, inducible activation of Nrf2 in mice and transgenesis of the Nrf2 target, NQO1, conferred protection from diet-induced metabolic defects through preservation of glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, and lipid handling with improved physiological outcomes. NQO1-RNA interaction mediated the association with and inhibition of the translational machinery in skeletal muscle of NQO1 transgenic mice. NQO1-Tg mice on high-fat diet had lower adipose tissue macrophages and enhanced expression of lipogenic enzymes coincident with reduction in circulating and hepatic lipids. Metabolomics data revealed a systemic metabolic signature of improved glucose handling, cellular redox, and NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism while label-free quantitative mass spectrometry in skeletal muscle uncovered a distinct diet- and genotype-dependent acetylation pattern of SIRT3 targets across the core of intermediary metabolism.

In the world, one in four people worldwide suffer from mental illness, especially pregnant women. β-Adrenergic receptor (β-AR) is an important regulator that converts environmental stimuli into intracellular signals in mice uterus. CD-1 (ICR) mice undergone restraint stress, which was a case in model to simulate the psychological stress. The plasma and implantation sites in uterus were obtained and examined. PCR analysis demonstrated that β<sub>2</sub>-AR expression levels in embryo day (E) 3, 5 and 7 were kept at a significantly higher level (<i>p</i> < 0.05) under restraint stress and higher than β<sub>1</sub>-AR and β<sub>3</sub>-AR in different gestation ages. The β<sub>2</sub>-AR protein levels were obviously increased (<i>p</i> < 0.05) due to the markedly elevated norepinephrine (NE) concentration (<i>p</i> < 0.05). In our previous study, restraint stress can induce the apoptosis and inflammation. Also, the matrix metalloprotein-9 (MMP-9) was decreased significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) under restraint stress. Meanwhile, Caspase3, p-NF-κB p65 and p-ERK1/2 were obviously increased (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in the work. <i>In vitro</i> studies showed that the p-ERK1/2 and Caspase-3 levels were raised (<i>p</i> < 0.05) after β<sub>2</sub>-AR was activated. However, they were decreased when PKA was blocked. The protein levels of Caspase-3 were reduced when ERK and NF-κB were blocked (<i>p</i> < 0.05). In conclusion, the β<sub>2</sub>-AR/cAMP/PKA pathway promoted apoptosis and affected the development of the uterus through the ERK and NF-κB signaling pathway.

This review summarizes the current knowledge about the harmful effects of high-fat/high-sugar diets, micronutrient deficiencies (folate, manganese, and carotenoids), obesity and associated complications, bacterial/viral infections, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, sleep deprivation, chronic stress, air pollution, and chemical exposure on inflammation through epigenetic mechanisms. Additionally, the epigenetic phenomena underlying the anti-inflammatory potential of caloric restriction, n-3 PUFA, Mediterranean diet, vitamin D, zinc, polyphenols (i.e., resveratrol, gallic acid, epicatechin, luteolin, curcumin), and the role of systematic exercise are discussed. Original and review articles encompassing epigenetics and inflammation were screened from major databases (including PubMed, Medline, Science Direct, Scopus, etc.) and analyzed for the writing of the review paper.

We hypothesized that polygenetic risk scores (PRS) of the selected genetic variants among the ARC-related genes might reveal significant genetic impacts on ARC risk, and the PRS might have gene-gene and gene-lifestyle interactions. We examined the hypothesis in 1972 and 39,095 subjects aged ≥50 years with and without ARC, respectively, in a large-scale hospital-based cohort study conducted from 2004 to 2013. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the genes related to ARC risk were identified, and polygenetic risk scores (PRS) were generated based on the results of a generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis. Lifestyle interactions with PRS were evaluated. The PRS derived from the best model included the following six SNPs related to crystallin metabolism: <i>ULK4</i>_rs1417380362, <i>CRYAB</i>_rs2070894, <i>ACCN1</i>_rs55785344, <i>SSTR2</i>_rs879419608, <i>PTN</i>_rs322348, and <i>ICA1</i>_rs200053781. The risk of ARC in the high-PRS group was 2.47-fold higher than in the low-PRS group after adjusting for confounders. Age, blood pressure, and glycemia interacted with PRS to influence the risk of ARC: the incidence of ARC was much higher in the elderly (≥65 years) and individuals with hypertension or hyperglycemia. The impact of PRS on ARC risk was greatest in middle-aged individuals with hypertension or hyperglycemia. Na, coffee, and a Western-style diet intake also interacted with PRS to influence ARC risk. ARC risk was higher in the high-PRS group than in the low-PRS group, and high Na intake, Western-style diet, and low coffee intake elevated its risk. In conclusion, ARC risk had a positive association with PRS related to crystallin metabolism. The genetic impact was greatest among those with high Na intake or hypertension.

33167264,Universal linker Polymerase Chain Reaction-triggered Strand Displacement Amplification visual biosensor for ultra-sensitive detection of Salmonella.,"Salmonella is a principal causal agent of pathogenic outbreaks via food. A universal, highly sensitive and visual Salmonella detection method was proposed in this paper, based on a universal linker PCR (UL-PCR)-triggered Strand Displacement Amplification (SDA). In this research, the UL-PCR achieved the primary amplification. The universal linker primer was ingeniously designed and composed of two parts, one of which was the binding sequence of the target, and the other was the universal linker. Complementary sequences of the G-quadruplex and the nicking endonuclease recognition sequence were included in the universal linker. Therefore, the G-quadruplexes and nicking sites were successfully introduced into the UL-PCR products, providing a basis for further SDA triggering. SDA achieved the secondary signal amplification and generated a large amount of label-free DNAzymes. Following SDA, DNAzymes catalyzed 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylaniline (TMB) into colored compounds visible to the naked eye. We obtained the best experimental conditions by univariate analysis. Under optimal conditions, this proposed universal label-free method could detect Salmonella genome at level as low as 22 copies mL<sup>-1</sup>, with an excellent linear range between 10<sup>2</sup> copies mL<sup>-1</sup> and 10<sup>7</sup> copies mL<sup>-1</sup>.

Additional Analyses on Type-2 Diabetes Risk.","Gene-age interactions have not been systematically investigated on metabolic phenotypes and this modulation will be key for a better understanding of the temporal regulation in nutrigenomics. Taking into account that aging is typically associated with both impairment of the circadian system and a decrease in melatonin secretion, we focused on the melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B)-rs10830963 C>G variant that has been associated with fasting glucose concentrations, gestational diabetes, and type-2 diabetes. Therefore, our main aim was to investigate whether the association between the MTNR1B-rs10830963 polymorphism and fasting glucose is age dependent. Our secondary aims were to analyze the polymorphism association with type-2 diabetes and explore the gene-pregnancies interactions on the later type-2 diabetes risk. Three Mediterranean cohorts (<i>n</i> = 2823) were analyzed. First, a cross-sectional study in the discovery cohort consisting of 1378 participants (aged 18 to 80 years; mean age 41 years) from the general population was carried out. To validate and extend the results, two replication cohorts consisting of elderly individuals were studied. In the discovery cohort, we observed a strong gene-age interaction (<i>p</i> = 0.001), determining fasting glucose in such a way that the increasing effect of the risk G-allele was much greater in young (<i>p</i> = 5.9 × 10<sup>-10</sup>) than in elderly participants (<i>p</i> = 0.805). Consistently, the association of the MTNR1B-rs10830963 polymorphism with fasting glucose concentrations in the two replication cohorts (mean age over 65 years) did not reach statistical significance (<i>p</i> > 0.05 for both). However, in the elderly cohorts, significant associations between the polymorphism and type-2 diabetes at baseline were found. Moreover, in one of the cohorts, we obtained a statistically significant interaction between the MTNR1B polymorphism and the number of pregnancies, retrospectively assessed, on the type-2 diabetes risk. In conclusion, the association of the MTNR1B-rs10830963 polymorphism with fasting glucose is age-dependent, having a greater effect in younger people. However, in elderly subjects, associations of the polymorphism with type-2 diabetes were observed and our exploratory analysis suggested a modulatory effect of the number of past pregnancies on the future type-2 diabetes genetic risk.",Sorlí JV; Barragán R; Coltell O; Portolés O; Pascual EC; Ortega-Azorín C; González JI; Estruch R; Saiz C; Pérez-Fidalgo A; Ordovas JM; Corella D,Nutrients,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33138317/,0,0,0,0,0,0
33122069,Rod-shaped polypeptide nanoparticles for siRNA delivery.,"Rod-shaped nanoparticles have been reported to exhibit improved cellular uptake, intracellular processing and transport through tissues and organs, as compared to spherical nanoparticles. We use C-S-B triblock polypeptides composed of a collagen-like block (C), a silk-like block (S) and an oligolysine domain (B) for one-dimensional co-assembly with siRNA into rod-shaped nanoparticles. Here we investigate these siRNA encapsulating rod-shaped nanoparticles as a gene delivery system. Uptake experiments for C-S-B and C-S-B/siPlk1 particles indicate that these rod-shaped nanoparticles can efficiently deliver siPlk1 into HeLa cells. Moreover, C-S-B/siPlk1 complexes display significant mPlk1 gene knockdown in a dose-dependent manner, causing apoptosis as intended. The lower effectiveness of C-S-B/siPlk1 in inducing cell death as compared to cationic lipid-based formulations is explained by the high lysosome-C-S-B/siPlk1 co-localization ratio, which will need to be addressed in a future redesign of polypeptide sequence. Overall, the non-toxic and unique rod-shaped C-S-B nanoparticles deserve further optimization as a new siRNA delivery system for cancer therapy.",Li D; Li X; Bai J; Liu Y; de Vries R; Li Y,International journal of biological macromolecules,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33122069/,0,0,0,0,0,0

The present study included 377 subjects with glaucoma and 47,820 subjects without glaucoma in a large-scale hospital-based cohort study from 2004 to 2013. The presence of glaucoma was evaluated by a diagnostic questionnaire evaluated by a doctor. The genome-wide association study was performed to identify genetic variants associated with glaucoma risk. Food intake was assessed using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. We performed generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis to construct polygenetic-risk score (PRS) and explored gene × nutrient interaction.

We hypothesized that the FADS2 gene variants will be associated with lower product-to-precursor ratio in the fatty acid metabolic pathways. Thus, we explored FADS2 rs174593, rs174616, and rs174576 effects on plasma phospholipid fatty acid profile, markers of desaturase activities, and risk factors in a sample of apparently healthy Serbian adults. Food and nutrient intake data were compiled through 24 h recalls. Plasma phospholipid fatty acid content was assessed by gas-chromatography. Estimated desaturase activities were calculated as conversion rates towards LC-PUFA in omega-6 pathway. During the selection of FADS2 polymorphisms, we accounted for their positional and functional aspect. Genotyping was performed by Real-Time PCR. Multivariable-adjusted general linear and hierarchical regression models were applied. Study subjects (mean age = 40 ± 7 years, 70% who were overweight) had a median dietary omega-6/omega-3 ratio of 16.29.

However, its exact mode of action and effect remain ambiguous. In this study, we established a BALB/c mouse cholera toxin/ovalbumin-induced food allergy model to determine the molecular basis and signaling mechanisms of the immune regulation of cholera toxin during food allergy. The adjuvant activity of cholera toxin was analyzed by establishing mouse allergy model, and the allergic reaction of each group of mice was evaluated. The effect of cholera toxin on Th1/Th2 cell differentiation was analyzed to further explore the role of cholera toxin in allergen immune response. We stimulated bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) with cholera toxin in vitro to investigate the effect of cholera toxin on Notch ligand expression. BMDCs and naive CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells were co-cultured in vitro, and their cytokine levels were examined to investigate whether cholera toxin regulates Th cell differentiation via the Jagged2 Notch signaling pathway. The results showed that in the presence of allergens, cholera toxin promotes Th2 cell differentiation and enhances the body's immune response. Cholera toxin induces expression of the Notch ligand Jagged2, but Jagged2 Notch signaling pathway is not required to promote BMDCs-mediated differentiation of Th2 cells.

However, little is known about the physiological effect of DIV1 infection on the host. In this study, we found that the lethal dose 50 of DIV1-infected <i>Litopenaeus vannamei</i> after 48, 72, 96, and 156 h were 4.86 × 10<sup>6</sup>, 5.07 × 10<sup>5</sup>, 2.13 × 10<sup>5</sup>, and 2.38 × 10<sup>4</sup> copies/μg DNA, respectively. In order to investigate the mechanisms of DIV1 infection, a comparative transcriptome analysis of hemocytes from <i>L. vannamei</i>, infected or not with DIV1, was conducted. The BUSCO analysis showed that the transcriptome was with high completeness (complete single-copy BUSCOs: 57.3%, complete duplicated BUSCOs: 41.1%, fragmentation: 0.8%, missing: 0.8%). A total of 168,854 unigenes were assembled, with an average length of 601 bp. Based on homology searches, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), gene ontology (GO), and cluster of orthologous groups of proteins (KOG) analysis, 62,270 (36.88%) unigenes were annotated. Among them, 1,112 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, of which 889 genes were up-regulated and 223 genes were down-regulated after DIV1 infection. These genes were mainly annotated to the major metabolic processes such as fructose and mannose metabolism, carbon metabolism, and inositol phosphate metabolism. Among these metabolic pathways, the triosephosphate isomerase (<i>TPI</i>) family was the most eye-catching DEG as it participates in several metabolic processes. Three types of <i>TPI, LvTPI-like, LvTPI-Blike</i>, and <i>LvTPI-Blike1</i>, were obtained for gene silencing by RNA interference.

32973753,Requisite Omega-3 HUFA Biomarker Thresholds for Preventing Murine Lupus Flaring.,"Lupus is a systemic autoimmune disease typified by uncontrolled inflammation, disruption of immune tolerance, and intermittent flaring - events triggerable by environmental factors. Preclinical and clinical studies reveal that consumption of the marine ω-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) might be used as a precision nutrition intervention to lessen lupus symptoms. The anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving effects of ω-3 HUFAs are inextricably linked to their presence in membrane phospholipids. The ω-3 HUFA score, calculated as [100 × (ω-3 HUFAs/(ω-3 HUFAs + ω-6 HUFAs))] in red blood cells (RBCs), and the Omega-3 Index (O3I), calculated as [100 × ((DHA+EPA)/total fatty acids)] in RBCs, are two biomarkers potentially amenable to relating tissue HUFA balance to clinical outcomes in individuals with lupus. Using data from three prior preclinical DHA supplementation studies, we tested the hypothesis that the ω-3 HUFA score and the O3I inversely correlate with indicators of autoimmune pathogenesis in the cSiO<sub>2</sub>-triggered lupus flaring model. The three studies employed both low and high fat rodent diets, as well as more complex diets emulating the U.S. dietary pattern. The ω-3 HUFA scores in RBCs were comparatively more robust than the O3I at predicting HUFA balances in the kidney, liver, spleen, and lung. Importantly, increases in both the ω-3 HUFA score (>40%) and the O3I (>10%) were strongly associated with suppression of cSiO<sub>2</sub>-triggered (1) expression of interferon-regulated genes, proinflammatory cytokine production, leukocyte infiltration, and ectopic lymphoid structure development in the lung, (2) pulmonary and systemic autoantibody production, and (3) glomerulonephritis. Collectively, these findings identify achievable ω-3 HUFA scores and O3I thresholds that could be targeted in future human intervention studies querying how ω-3 HUFA consumption influences lupus and other autoimmune diseases.",Wierenga KA; Strakovsky RS; Benninghoff AD; Rajasinghe LD; Lock AL; Harkema JR; Pestka JJ,Frontiers in immunology,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32973753/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Four isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets were formulated by replacing 0, 10, 30, and 50% fish meal protein with soybean meal (namely FM, SBM10, SBM30, and SBM50, respectively). The weight gain rate of the SBM50 group was significantly lower than those of the other groups. Plica height, muscular layer thickness, and goblet cells of the distal intestine in the SBM50 group were much lower than those in the FM group. The intestinal transcriptomic data, including the transcriptome and miRNAome, showed that a total of 6,390 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 92 DEmiRNAs were identified in the SBM50 and FM groups. DEmiRNAs (10 known and 1 novel miRNAs) and their DE target genes were involved in immune-related phagosome, natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, and the intestinal immune network for IgA production pathways.

Animal and cell studies have shown benefits of vitamin A (VA) on BF% and lipid metabolism, but it is still controversial in humans. Furthermore, although some genetic variants may explain heterogeneity in VA plasma levels, their role in VA metabolic response is still scarcely characterized. This study was designed as a combination of an observational study involving 158 male subjects followed by a study with a well-balanced genotype-phenotype protocol, including in the design an ex vivo intervention study performed on isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of the 41 former males. This is a strategy to accurately identify the delivery of Precision Nutrition recommendations to targeted subjects. The study assesses the influence of rs5888 (<i>SCARB1</i>), rs659366 (<i>UCP2</i>), and rs1800629 (<i>UCP1</i>) variants on higher BF% associated with suboptimal VA consumption and underlines the cellular mechanisms involved by analyzing basal and retinoic acid (RA) response on PBMC gene expression. Data show that male carriers with the major allele combinations and following suboptimal-VA diet show higher BF% (adjusted ANOVA test <i>p</i>-value = 0.006). Genotype-BF% interaction is observed on oxidative/inflammatory gene expression and also influences lipid related gene expression in response to RA. Data indicate that under suboptimal consumption of VA, carriers of VA responsive variants and with high-BF% show a gene expression profile consistent with an impaired basal metabolic state. The results show the relevance of consuming VA within the required amounts, its impact on metabolism and energy balance, and consequently, on men's adiposity with a clear influence of genetic variants <i>SCARB1</i>, <i>UCP2</i> and <i>UCP1</i>.",Galmés S; Palou A; Serra F,Nutrients,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32858880/,0,0,0,0,0,0
32846216,Selenoprotein V protects against endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative injury induced by pro-oxidants.,"Selenoprotein V (SELENOV) contains a thioredoxin-like fold and a conserved CxxU motif with a potential redox function. This study was to assess its in vivo and in vitro roles and mechanisms in coping with different oxidant insults. In Experiment (Expt.)1, SELENOV knockout (KO) and wild type (WT) mice (male, 8-wk old) were given an ip injection of saline, diquat (DQ, 12.5 mg/kg), or N-acetyl-para-aminophenol (APAP, 300 mg/kg) (n = 10), and killed 5 h after the injection. In Expt. 2, primary hepatocytes of WT and KO were treated with DQ (0-0.75 mM) or APAP (0-6 mM) for 12 h. In Expt. 3, 293 T cells overexpressing Selenov gene (OE) were treated with APAP (0-4 mM) for 24 h or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (0-0.4 mM) for 12 h. Compared with the WT, the DQ- and APAP-injected KO mice had higher (P < 0.05) serum alanine aminotransferase activities and hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related proteins (BIP and CHOP), apoptosis-related proteins (FAK and caspase-9), and 3-nitrotyrosine, along with lower total anti-oxidizing-capability (T-AOC) and severer hepatic necrosis. Likewise, the DQ and APAP-treated KO hepatocytes had elevated (P < 0.05) cell death (10-40%), decreased (P < 0.05) T-AOC (63-83%), glutathione (26-87%), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity (28-36%), mRNA levels of redox enzymes (Cat, Gcs, Gpx3, and Sod) and (or) sharper declines (P < 0.05) in cellular respiration and ATP production than that of the WT cells. In contrast, the OE cells had greater viability and T-AOC and lower MDA, and carbonyl contents after the APAP and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposures (all at P < 0.05) than the controls. Moreover, the OE cells had greater (P < 0.05) redox enzyme activities (GPX, TrxR, and SOD), and lower (P < 0.05) expressions of ER stress-related genes (Atf4, Atf6, Bip, Xbp1t, Xbp1s, and Chop) and proteins (BIP, CHOP, FAK, and caspase-9) than the control cells after the treatment of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (0.4 mM).

32814209,Ultrasensitive magnetic DNAzyme-copper nanoclusters fluorescent biosensor with triple amplification for the visual detection of E. coli O157:H7.,"A relatively-simple and high-efficient fluorescent magnetic biosensor based on DNAzyme was established for the detection of E. coli O157:H7. In order to solve the problem of weak signal and low sensitivity in the detection of foodborne pathogenic bacteria, we ingeniously designed a fluorescent sensor based on triple signal amplification of magnetic beads, DNAzyme and photoluminescence. In the detection process, the E. coli-specific RNA-cleaving DNAzyme can specifically identify the target protein in crude intracellular mixture (CIM), which caused its conformation changes and induced rolling circle amplification (RCA) to the generation and luminescence of copper nanoclusters (CuNCs). This cascade amplification design can capture weak signals in the sample. The biosensor also indicated a good linear range from 10 CFU mL<sup>-1</sup> to 1000 CFU mL<sup>-1</sup> and obtained a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.57 CFU mL<sup>-1</sup>, which showed a relatively high sensitivity compared with other studies. Furthermore, the biosensor displayed high-efficient detection capability in 1.5 h and good reproducibility (relative standard deviations < 2%). It has been proved that this sensor is feasible to the detection of E. coli O157:H7 in drinking water and apple juice. Moreover, we found that the final detection product can effectively wrap the magnetic beads and can be driven by the magnetic field.

In pre-amplification stage, the event-specific primers contain a universal sequence at the 5' end, with a biotin-labeled deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) deoxynucleotide providing additional amplification, which improves their amplification ability and ensures consistent multiplex amplification efficiency. In the signal recognition strategy, the SUP-RPA products are identified visually using the lateral flow biosensor (LFB) through dual hybridization. The accumulation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) produces a characteristic red band. Through this biosensor, a limit of detection of at least 50 copies was achieved, which is sensitive enough to detect MON810, MON863 and MON89034 simultaneously. The entire process of analysis was completed within 30 min and without any large-scale instrumentation. This biosensor, therefore, provides a novel rapid and portable multiple detection method for point-of-care applications, especially genetically modified organism (GMO) event-specific detection.",Li K; Luo Y; Huang K; Yang Z; Wan Y; Xu W,Analytica chimica acta,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32800127/,0,0,0,0,0,0
32732975,Auranofin mitigates systemic iron overload and induces ferroptosis via distinct mechanisms.,"Iron homeostasis is essential for health; moreover, hepcidin-deficiency results in iron overload in both hereditary hemochromatosis and iron-loading anemia. Here, we identified iron modulators by functionally screening hepcidin agonists using a library of 640 FDA-approved drugs in human hepatic Huh7 cells. We validated the results in C57BL/6J mice and a mouse model of hemochromatosis (Hfe<sup>-/-</sup> mice). Our screen revealed that the anti-rheumatoid arthritis drug auranofin (AUR) potently upregulates hepcidin expression. Interestingly, we found that canonical signaling pathways that regulate iron, including the Bmp/Smad and IL-6/Jak2/Stat3 pathways, play indispensable roles in mediating AUR's effects. In addition, AUR induces IL-6 via the NF-κB pathway. In C57BL/6J mice, acute treatment with 5 mg/kg AUR activated hepatic IL-6/hepcidin signaling and decreased serum iron and transferrin saturation. Whereas chronically treating male Hfe<sup>-/-</sup> mice with 5 mg/kg AUR activated hepatic IL-6/hepcidin signaling, decreasing systemic iron overload, but less effective in females. Further analyses revealed that estrogen reduced the ability of AUR to induce IL-6/hepcidin signaling in Huh7 cells, providing a mechanistic explanation for ineffectiveness of AUR in female Hfe<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Notably, high-dose AUR (25 mg/kg) induces ferroptosis and causes lipid peroxidation through inhibition of thioredoxin reductase (TXNRD) activity. We demonstrate the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin significantly protects liver toxicity induced by high-dose AUR without comprising its beneficial effect on iron metabolism. In conclusion, our findings provide compelling evidence that TXNRD is a key regulator of ferroptosis, and AUR is a novel activator of hepcidin and ferroptosis via distinct mechanisms, suggesting a promising approach for treating hemochromatosis and hepcidin-deficiency related disorders.",Yang L; Wang H; Yang X; Wu Q; An P; Jin X; Liu W; Huang X; Li Y; Yan S; Shen S; Liang T; Min J; Wang F,Signal transduction and targeted therapy,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32732975/,0,0,0,0,0,0
32726617,Cycling Stem Cells Are Radioresistant and Regenerate the Intestine.,"A certain number of epithelial cells in intestinal crypts are DNA damage resistant and contribute to regeneration. However, the cellular mechanism underlying intestinal regeneration remains unclear. Using lineage tracing, we show that cells marked by an Msi1 reporter (Msi1<sup>+</sup>) are right above Lgr5<sup>high</sup> cells in intestinal crypts and exhibit DNA damage resistance. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that the Msi1<sup>+</sup> cells are heterogeneous with the majority being intestinal stem cells (ISCs). The DNA damage-resistant subpopulation of Msi1<sup>+</sup> cells is characterized by low-to-negative Lgr5 expression and is more rapidly cycling than Lgr5<sup>high</sup> radiosensitive crypt base columnar stem cells (CBCs). This enables an efficient repopulation of the intestinal epithelium at early stage when Lgr5<sup>high</sup> cells are not emerging. Furthermore, relative to CBCs, Msi1<sup>+</sup> cells preferentially produce Paneth cells during homeostasis and upon radiation repair. Together, we demonstrate that the DNA damage-resistant Msi1<sup>+</sup> cells are cycling ISCs that maintain and regenerate the intestinal epithelium.",Sheng X; Lin Z; Lv C; Shao C; Bi X; Deng M; Xu J; Guerrero-Juarez CF; Li M; Wu X; Zhao R; Yang X; Li G; Liu X; Wang Q; Nie Q; Cui W; Gao S; Zhang H; Liu Z; Cong Y; Plikus MV; Lengner CJ; Andersen B; Ren F; Yu Z,Cell reports,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32726617/,0,0,0,0,0,0

In principle, these personalized nutrition products are formulated based on the genetics, epigenetics, metabolism, microbiome, phenotype, lifestyle, age, gender, and health status of a person. A challenge in this area is to create customized functional food and beverage products that contain the required combination of bioactive agents, such as lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, nutraceuticals, prebiotics and probiotics. Nanotechnology may facilitate the development of these kind of products since it can be used to encapsulate one or more bioactive agent in a single colloidal delivery system. This delivery system may contain one or more different kinds of colloidal particle, specifically designed to protect each nutrient in the food, but then deliver it in a bioavailable form after ingestion. This review article provides an overview of the different kinds of bioactives that need to be delivered, as well as some of the challenges associated with incorporating them into functional foods and beverages.

32649903,Arachidonic Acid Promotes Intestinal Regeneration by Activating WNT Signaling.,"Intestinal regeneration is crucial for functional restoration after injury, and nutritional molecules can play an important role in this process. Here, we found that arachidonic acid (AA) serves as a direct proliferation promoter of intestinal epithelial cells that facilitates small intestinal regeneration in both three-dimensional cultured organoids and mouse models. As shown in the study, during post-irradiation regeneration, AA positively regulates intestinal epithelial cell proliferation by upregulating the expression of Ascl2 and activating WNT signaling, but negatively regulates intestinal epithelial cell differentiation. AA acts as a delicate regulator that efficiently facilitates epithelial tissue repair by activating radiation-resistant Msi1<sup>+</sup> cells rather than Lgr5<sup>+</sup> cells, which are extensively considered WNT-activated crypt base stem cells. Additionally, short-term AA treatment maintains optimal intestinal epithelial homeostasis under physiological conditions. As a result, AA treatment can be considered a potential therapy for irradiation injury repair and tissue regeneration.",Wang Q; Lin Y; Sheng X; Xu J; Hou X; Li Y; Zhang H; Guo H; Yu Z; Ren F,Stem cell reports,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32649903/,0,0,0,0,0,0
32607778,Single-cell sequencing reveals novel mechanisms of Aflatoxin B1-induced hepatotoxicity in S phase-arrested L02 cells.,"Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is widely distributed in nature and is confirmed to be the most toxic of all the aflatoxins, whose predominant metabolism site is the liver. As a well-studied and vital mode of epigenetic modifications, aberrant methylation of the promoters in eukaryotic cells may cause the silence of essential genes, affecting their related transcriptional pathways and ultimately leading to the development of disease and cancers. This study investigated the mechanisms of AFB1-induced hepatotoxicity in S phase-arrested L02 cells using single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). AFB1 induced apoptosis and cell cycle S phase arrest, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, as well as the DNA methylation level. Hepatotoxicity mechanism patterns induced by AFB1 in S phase-arrested L02 cells were revealed by combining single-cell RNA-seq with single-cell RRBS analysis, in which DNA methylation played a role via regulating the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor pathway, the Wnt signaling pathway, and the TGF-beta signaling pathway. Moreover, a novel strategy for precision toxicology exploration was obtained, including the selection of target cells, multi-group non-directional sequencing, and pathway analysis.",Zhang B; Dai Y; Zhu L; He X; Huang K; Xu W,Cell biology and toxicology,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32607778/,0,0,0,0,0,0
32580458,Sex-Specific Associations between Gut Prevotellaceae and Host Genetics on Adiposity.,"The gut microbiome has been recognized as a tool for understanding adiposity accumulation and for providing personalized nutrition advice for the management of obesity and accompanying metabolic complications. The genetic background is also involved in human energy homeostasis. In order to increase the value of nutrigenetic dietary advice, the interplay between genetics and microbiota must be investigated. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate interactive associations between gut microbiota composition and 95 obesity-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) searched in the literature. Oral mucosa and fecal samples from 360 normal weight, overweight and obese subjects were collected. Next generation genotyping of these 95 SNPs and fecal 16S rRNA sequencing were performed. A genetic risk score (GRS) was constructed with 10 SNPs statistically or marginally associated with body mass index (BMI). Several microbiome statistical analyses at family taxonomic level were applied (LEfSe, Canonical Correspondence Analysis, MetagenomeSeq and Random Forest), and Prevotellaceae family was found in all of them as one of the most important bacterial families associated with BMI and GRS. Thus, in this family it was further analyzed the interactive association between BMI and GRS with linear regression models. Interestingly, women with higher abundance of Prevotellaceae and higher GRS were more obese, compared to women with higher GRS and lower abundance of Prevotellaceae. These findings suggest relevant interrelationships between Prevotellaceae and the genetic background that may determine interindividual BMI differences in women, which opens the way to new precision nutrition-based treatments for obesity.",Cuevas-Sierra A; Riezu-Boj JI; Guruceaga E; Milagro FI; Martínez JA,Microorganisms,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32580458/,0,0,0,0,0,0

To mitigate these challenges, a 'turn-on' ultra-sensitive multiplex real-time fluorescent quantitative biosensor is developed. In this system, the multiplex ligation-dependent amplification (MLPA), universal primer and universal probe are innovatively combined, which can enhanced the amplification specificity, overcome asymmetric amplification and guarantee the homogeneity of amplification efficiency simultaneously. Furthermore, both single and multiplex detection results can be output by the fluorescent group labeled on universal TaqMan probes for different targets in real-time. After optimization, the quantitative detection limit was 5 pg. In conclusion, this strategy could serve as an important tool for GMO detection in processed and commercially available products, even in the fields that require reliable and sensitive detection of DNA targets.",Xiao B; Niu C; Shang Y; Xu Y; Huang K; Zhang X; Xu W,Food chemistry,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32535319/,0,0,0,0,0,0

We investigated associations of <i>AMY1</i> genetic variations with general and central adiposity changes considering dietary carbohydrate intake among 32,054 adults from four prospective cohort studies. A genetic risk score (GRS) was calculated based on nine <i>AMY1</i> single-nucleotide polymorphisms, with higher AMY1-GRS indicating higher activity of salivary amylase. We meta-analyzed interactions between AMY1-GRS and dietary intake for changes in general and central adiposity over 5.5-10 years. We found that carbohydrate food intake significantly altered associations of AMY1-GRS with changes in BMI (<i>P</i> <sub>interaction</sub> = 0.001) and waist circumference (<i>P</i> <sub>interaction</sub> < 0.001). Results were consistent and significant in female cohorts rather than in male cohorts. Among women, higher AMY1-GRS was associated with more increases in adiposity if dietary carbohydrate food intake was high, while higher AMY1-GRS was associated with less gains in adiposity when the dietary intake was low. Also, in a 2-year randomized dietary intervention trial, associations of AMY1-GRS with changes in weight (<i>P</i> <sub>interaction</sub> = 0.023) and waist circumference (<i>P</i> <sub>interaction</sub> = 0.037) were significantly modified by carbohydrate intake.

32488386,Duplex-specific nuclease-resistant triple-helix DNA nanoswitch for single-base differentiation of miRNA in lung cancer cells.,"In this work, a duplex-specific nuclease (DSN)-resistant triplex-helix DNA nanoswitch was designed for assays of single-base differentiation of the let-7a family in lung cancer cells. Initially, although a 10-bp duplex stem in the nanoswitch was cleaved to pieces, a 10-bp triplex stem was resistant to DSN. Consequently, a triple-stranded DNA structure resistant to DSN was obtained. The pH-dependent formation of the triplex structure then produced the pH-related nanoswitch/miRNA hybrid, and the metastable nanoswitch generated an obvious signal increase at pH 6.8. Surprisingly, the pH condition at 6.8 for the best nanoswitch/miRNA hybrid is consistent with the optimal DSN catalysis, which paves the way for a first-rank DSN signal amplification (DSNSA) strategy for the single-base selective capacity of the homologous let-7a family with a limit of detection of 0.26 pM. The cyclic strategy based on the DSN-mediated triplex-helix DNA nanoswitch was verified in lung cancer cell samples and exhibited better discriminatory ability without user-unfriendly nucleotide modification or extra probe-mediated assistance, showing excellent potential for application in biomedical sensing and clinical diagnosis. Graphical abstract Based on the discovery that a triple-helix DNA nanoswitch is resistant to DSN and that the nanoswitch/miRNA hybridization was pH-related, pH at 6.8, which is suitable for the optimal nanoswitch/miRNA hybrid and DSN catalysis, reinforced the DSNSA strategy for the single-base selective capacity of the homologous let-7a family with a limit of detection of 0.26 pM.",Tian J; Chu H; Zhu L; Xu W,Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32488386/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Here, we generated hepatocyte-specific Trf knockout mice (Trf-LKO), which are viable and fertile but have impaired erythropoiesis and altered iron metabolism. Moreover, feeding Trf-LKO mice a high-iron diet increased their susceptibility to developing ferroptosis-induced liver fibrosis. Importantly, we found that treating Trf-LKO mice with the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 potently rescued liver fibrosis induced by either high dietary iron or carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) injections. In addition, deleting hepatic Slc39a14 expression in Trf-LKO mice significantly reduced hepatic iron accumulation, thereby reducing ferroptosis-mediated liver fibrosis induced by either a high-iron diet or CCl4 injections. Finally, we found that patients with liver cirrhosis have significantly lower levels of serum transferrin and hepatic transferrin, as well as higher levels of hepatic iron and lipid peroxidation, compared with healthy control subjects. Taken together, these data indicate that hepatic transferrin plays a protective role in maintaining liver function, providing a possible therapeutic target for preventing ferroptosis-induced liver fibrosis.",Yu Y; Jiang L; Wang H; Shen Z; Cheng Q; Zhang P; Wang J; Wu Q; Fang X; Duan L; Wang S; Wang K; An P; Shao T; Chung RT; Zheng S; Min J; Wang F,Blood,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32374849/,0,0,0,0,0,0
32353602,Proteomics reveals the alleviation of zinc towards aflatoxin B1-induced cytotoxicity in human hepatocyes (HepG2 cells).,"Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a known carcinogen found in contaminated food and designated by the World Health Organization as a class I carcinogenic substance. AFB1 presents with carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and mutagenicity, and the liver is the human organ most susceptible to AFB1. Zinc (Zn), which is one of the essential nutrient elements that could protect the cells from biological toxins, heavy metals, hydrogen peroxide, metal chelators and radiation, is assessed in this study for its potential to alleviate AFB1-induced cytotoxicity. Samples were divided into three groups, namely CK, AFB1, and AFB1+Zn. Protein expressions were analyzed by two-way electrophoresis combined with flight mass spectrometry, with 41 differentially expressed proteins identified in the results, mainly related to oxidative stress, cell apoptosis, DNA damage, and energy metabolism. Zn was found to regulate the expression of peroxidases (peroxiredoxin-1, peroxiredoxin-5, peroxiredoxin-6) to relieve AFB1-induced oxidative stress. Moreover, Zn could decrease the expression of pro-apoptotic genes (cleaved-caspase-3, caspase-9, and Bax) and increase the expression of anti-apoptotic genes (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl) to alleviate the cell apoptosis induced by AFB1. In addition, AFB1 reduced intracellular ATP levels, whereas Zn supplementation boosted ATP levels and maintained homeostasis and a steady state of cellular energy metabolism by modulating AMPK-ACC phosphorylation levels, while many zinc finger proteins changed after AFB1 treatment. These results, therefore, indicate that Zn could alleviate AFB1-induced cytotoxicity by changing the expressions of zinc finger proteins in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2 cells).",Zhu L; Huang C; Yang X; Zhang B; He X; Xu W; Huang K,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32353602/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Both iron deficiency and iron overload are associated with cardiomyopathy and heart failure via complex mechanisms. Although ferritin plays a central role in iron metabolism by storing excess cellular iron, the molecular function of ferritin in cardiomyocytes remains unknown. To characterize the functional role of Fth (ferritin H) in mediating cardiac iron homeostasis and heart disease. Mice expressing a conditional Fth knockout allele were crossed with 2 distinct Cre recombinase-expressing mouse lines, resulting in offspring that lack <i>Fth</i> expression specifically in myocytes (MCK-Cre) or cardiomyocytes (Myh6-Cre). Mice lacking Fth in cardiomyocytes had decreased cardiac iron levels and increased oxidative stress, resulting in mild cardiac injury upon aging. However, feeding these mice a high-iron diet caused severe cardiac injury and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with molecular features typical of ferroptosis, including reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and increased lipid peroxidation. Ferrostatin-1, a specific inhibitor of ferroptosis, rescued this phenotype, supporting the notion that ferroptosis plays a pathophysiological role in the heart. Finally, we found that Fth-deficient cardiomyocytes have reduced expression of the ferroptosis regulator Slc7a11, and overexpressing Slc7a11 selectively in cardiomyocytes increased GSH levels and prevented cardiac ferroptosis. Our findings provide compelling evidence that ferritin plays a major role in protecting against cardiac ferroptosis and subsequent heart failure, thereby providing a possible new therapeutic target for patients at risk of developing cardiomyopathy.",Fang X; Cai Z; Wang H; Han D; Cheng Q; Zhang P; Gao F; Yu Y; Song Z; Wu Q; An P; Huang S; Pan J; Chen HZ; Chen J; Linkermann A; Min J; Wang F,Circulation research,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32349646/,0,0,0,0,0,0
32344343,Luminescent DNAzyme and universal blocking linker Super Polymerase Chain Reaction visual biosensor for the detection of Salmonella.,"Here, we constructed a fast, universal, ""turn-on"" biosensor for the highly sensitive visual detection of Salmonella based on luminescent DNAzyme and a universal blocking linker Super Polymerase Chain Reaction (S-PCR). The primer in this biosensor was specially designed. The G-quadruplex sequence is attached to the 5' end of the primer by a blocking linker and is blocked in the stem part. The S-PCR amplification releases the G-quadruplex, which is incubated with hemin to form DNAzyme to exert peroxide-like activity. The visible colored products are generated by the addition of 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine. Detection sensitivity is high and, even when the concentration of the Salmonella genome in a sample is as low as 1.5 copies/µL, this color change can be seen with the naked eyes. Moreover, this method is simple and fast, as the S-PCR can be completed in less than 10 min using the newly built equipment and without the need for large instruments.",Li S; Zhang Y; Tian J; Xu W,Food chemistry,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32344343/,0,0,0,0,0,0
32235875,Contribution of macronutrients to obesity: implications for precision nutrition.,"The specific metabolic contribution of consuming different energy-yielding macronutrients (namely, carbohydrates, protein and lipids) to obesity is a matter of active debate. In this Review, we summarize the current research concerning associations between the intake of different macronutrients and weight gain and adiposity. We discuss insights into possible differential mechanistic pathways where macronutrients might act on either appetite or adipogenesis to cause weight gain. We also explore the role of dietary macronutrient distribution on thermogenesis or energy expenditure for weight loss and maintenance. On the basis of the data discussed, we describe a novel way to manage excessive body weight; namely, prescribing personalized diets with different macronutrient compositions according to the individual's genotype and/or enterotype. In this context, the interplay of macronutrient consumption with obesity incidence involves mechanisms that affect appetite, thermogenesis and metabolism, and the outcomes of these mechanisms are altered by an individual's genotype and microbiota. Indeed, the interactions of the genetic make-up and/or microbiota features of a person with specific macronutrient intakes or dietary pattern consumption help to explain individualized responses to macronutrients and food patterns, which might represent key factors for comprehensive precision nutrition recommendations and personalized obesity management.",San-Cristobal R; Navas-Carretero S; Martínez-González MÁ; Ordovas JM; Martínez JA,Nature reviews.

32167131,Prospective clinical trial examining the impact of genetic variation in FADS1 on the metabolism of linoleic acid- and ɣ-linolenic acid-containing botanical oils.,"Unexplained heterogeneity in clinical trials has resulted in questions regarding the effectiveness of ɣ-linolenic acid (GLA)-containing botanical oil supplements. This heterogeneity may be explained by genetic variation within the fatty acid desaturase (FADS) gene cluster that is associated with circulating and tissue concentrations of arachidonic acid (ARA) and dihomo-ɣ-linolenic acid (DGLA), both of which may be synthesized from GLA and result in proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory metabolites, respectively. The objective of this study was to prospectively compare the capacity of a non-Hispanic white cohort, stratified by FADS genotype at the key single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs174537, to metabolize 18-carbon omega-6 (n-6) PUFAs in borage oil (BO) and soybean oil (SO) to GLA, DGLA, and ARA. Healthy adults (n = 64) participated in a randomized, double-blind, crossover intervention. Individuals received encapsulated BO (Borago officinalis L.; 37% LA and 23% GLA) or SO [Glycine max (L.) Merr.; 50% LA and 0% GLA] for 4 wk, followed by an 8-wk washout period, before consuming the opposite oil for 4 wk. Serum lipids and markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein) were assessed for both oil types at baseline and during weeks 2 and 4 of the intervention. SO supplementation failed to alter circulating concentrations of any n-6 long-chain PUFAs. In contrast, a modest daily dose of BO elevated serum concentrations of GLA and DGLA in an rs174537 genotype-dependent manner. In particular, DGLA increased by 57% (95% CI: 0.38, 0.79) in GG genotype individuals, but by 141% (95% CI: 1.03, 2.85) in TT individuals. For ARA, baseline concentrations varied substantially by genotype and increased modestly with BO supplementation, suggesting a key role for FADS variation in the balance of DGLA and ARA. The results of this study clearly suggest that personalized and population-based approaches considering FADS genetic variation may be necessary to optimize the design of future clinical studies with GLA-containing oils.

32124713,dl-Methionine supplementation in a low-fishmeal diet affects the TOR/S6K pathway by stimulating ASCT2 amino acid transporter and insulin-like growth factor-I in the dorsal muscle of juvenile cobia (<i>Rachycentron canadum</i>).,"An 8-week feeding experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of dl-methionine (Met) supplementation in a low-fishmeal diet on growth, key gene expressions of amino acid transporters and target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway in juvenile cobia, Rachycentron canadum. Seven isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets were formulated, containing 0·72, 0·90, 1·00, 1·24, 1·41, 1·63 and 1·86 % Met. Weight gain and specific growth rates increased gradually with Met levels of up to 1·24 % and then decreased gradually. In dorsal muscle, mRNA levels of ASCT2 in the 1·00 % Met group were significantly up-regulated compared with 0·72, 1·63, and 1·86 %. The insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) mRNA levels in the dorsal muscle of fish fed 1·00 and 1·24 % Met were higher than those in fish fed other Met levels. In addition, fish fed 1·24 % Met showed the highest mRNA levels of TOR and phosphorylation of TOR on Ser2448. The phosphorylation of ribosomal p70-S6 kinase (S6K) on Ser371 in the dorsal muscle of fish fed 1·86 % Met was higher than those in the 0·72 % group. In conclusion, straight broken-line analysis of weight gain rate against dietary Met level indicates that the optimal Met requirement for juvenile cobia is 1·24 % (of DM, or 2·71 % dietary protein). Met supplementation in a low-fishmeal diet increased cobia growth via a mechanism that can partly be attributed to Met's ability to affect the TOR/S6K signalling pathway by enhancing ASCT2 and IGF-I transcription in cobia dorsal muscle.",He Y; Chi S; Tan B; Dong X; Yang Q; Liu H; Zhang S; Han F; Liu D,The British journal of nutrition,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32124713/,0,0,0,0,0,0
32108988,Gnpat does not play an essential role in systemic iron homeostasis in murine model.,"The GNPAT variant rs11558492 (p.D519G) was identified as a novel genetic factor that modifies the iron-overload phenotype in homozygous carriers of the HFE p.C282Y variant. However, the reported effects of the GNPAT p.D519G variant vary among study populations. Here, we investigated the role of GNPAT in iron metabolism using Gnpat-knockout (Gnpat<sup>-/-</sup> ), Gnpat/Hfe double-knockout (Gnpat<sup>-/-</sup> Hfe<sup>-/-</sup> or DKO) mice and hepatocyte-specific Gnpat-knockout mice (Gnpat<sup>fl/fl</sup> ;Alb-Cre). Our analysis revealed no significant difference between wild-type (Gnpat<sup>+/+</sup> ) and Gnpat<sup>-/-</sup> mice, between Hfe<sup>-/-</sup> and DKO mice, or between Gnpat<sup>fl/fl</sup> and Gnpat<sup>fl/fl</sup> ;Alb-Cre with respect to serum iron and tissue iron. In addition, the expression of hepcidin was not affected by deleting Gnpat expression in the presence or absence of Hfe. Feeding Gnpat<sup>-/-</sup> and DKO mice a high-iron diet had no effect on tissue iron levels compared with wild-type and Hfe<sup>-/-</sup> mice, respectively. Gnpat knockdown in primary hepatocytes from wild-type or Hfe<sup>-/-</sup> mice did not alter hepcidin expression, but it repressed BMP6-induced hepcidin expression. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that deleting Gnpat expression has no effect on either systemic iron metabolism or the iron-overload phenotype that develops in Hfe<sup>-/-</sup> mice, suggesting that GNPAT does not directly mediate iron homeostasis under normal or high-iron dietary conditions.",An P; Wang J; Wang H; Jiang L; Wang J; Min J; Wang F,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32108988/,0,0,0,0,0,0
32070783,"Influence of different oil sources on growth, disease resistance, immune response and immune-related gene expression on the hybrid grouper (♀ Epinephelus fuscoguttatus × ♂ E. lanceolatu), to Vibrio parahaemolyticus challenge.","The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of feeding alternative dietary oils to hybrid grouper fish (♀Epinephelus fuscoguttatus × ♂E. lanceolatu) on their growth, histological morphology of hepatocytes, disease resistance, immune response, and expression of immune-related genes. Seven experimental fish meal-based isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets were formulated containing 5% fish oil (FO; acting as controls) and various vegetable oils (VOs): corn oil (CO), sunflower oil (SO), tea oil (TO), olive oil (OO), rice oil (RO), and mixed oil (MO); comprising equal amounts of these oils). Each diet was fed to triplicate groups of 40 fish (initial mean body weight ± standard error = 15.09 ± 0.01 g) for eight weeks. The results show that 1) alternative dietary oils had no significant effects on weight gain rate, specific growth rate, protein efficiency ratio, and survival rate compared with controls (P > 0.05). The weight gain rate (WGR) and specific growth rate (SGR) of the SO group were lower than in the CO and OO groups. 2) These were no differences in morphological indexes among groups; except for the CO group, in which the condition factor and hepatosomatic index were lower than those in other groups. 3) Compared with controls, the whole-body moisture and crude protein contents in the VO groups were higher, while their crude lipid contents were lower. 4) The fatty acid contents in liver and muscle were affected by lipid type, and the contents of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in liver and muscle in the VO groups were markedly lower than in controls. 5) Compared with control group, VO groups damaged the histological morphology of hepatocytes. 6) After a challenge with the Vibrio parahaemolyticus bacterium, there were no differences in mortality among groups. However, VO enhanced the activity of non-specific immune enzymes while down-regulating the expression of Nrf2 and inducing the expression of pro-inflammatory factors (IL1β, TNFα, TLR22, and MyD88) in the kidney. It can be concluded that dietary VO substitution does not affect the growth of fish but damaged the histological morphology of hepatocytes and induced the expression of pro-inflammatory factors in tissues. Finally, OO and CO were recommended as the appropriate lipid replacement for FO.",Yan XB; Dong XH; Tan BP; Zhang S; Chi SY; Liu HY; Yang YZ,Fish & shellfish immunology,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32070783/,0,0,0,0,0,0
31968396,Circulating adiposity-related microRNAs as predictors of the response to a low-fat diet in subjects with obesity.,"Recent studies have revealed the critical role of several microRNAs (miRNAs) in energy homeostasis and metabolic processes and suggest that circulating miRNAs can be used as early predictors of weight loss in the design of precision nutrition. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate circulating adiposity-related miRNAs as biomarkers of the response to two specific weight loss dietary treatments. The expression of 86 miRNAs was investigated in plasma of 78 subjects with obesity randomized to two different diets [moderately high-protein diet (n = 38) and low-fat diet (n = 40)] and in 25 eutrophic controls (BMI ≤ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ). Bioinformatic analyses were performed to explore the target genes and biological pathways regulated by the dysregulated miRNAs. As results, 26 miRNAs were found differently expressed in eutrophic and volunteers with obesity. Moreover, 7 miRNAs (miR-130a-3p, miR-142-5p, miR-144-5p, miR-15a-5p, miR-22-3p, miR-221-3p and miR-29c-3p) were differentially expressed between responders and non-responders to a low-fat diet. Furthermore, after adjustment for basal glucose levels, 1-SD increase in miR-22-3p expression was associated with reduction in the risk of non-response to low-fat diet [OR = 0.181, 95% CI (0.084-0.947), P = .043]. Bioinformatic analyses evidenced that these 7 miRNAs regulate the expression of genes participating in important metabolic pathways. Conclusively, 7 circulating miRNAs related to adiposity could be used for predicting the response to a low-fat diet intervention prescribed to lose weight.",Assmann TS; Riezu-Boj JI; Milagro FI; Martínez JA,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31968396/,0,0,0,0,0,0
31928426,Precision (Personalized) Nutrition: Understanding Metabolic Heterogeneity.,"People differ in their requirements for and responses to nutrients and bioactive molecules in the diet. Many inputs contribute to metabolic heterogeneity (including variations in genetics, epigenetics, microbiome, lifestyle, diet intake, and environmental exposure). Precision nutrition is not about developing unique prescriptions for individual people but rather about stratifying people into different subgroups of the population on the basis of biomarkers of the above-listed sources of metabolic variation and then using this stratification to better estimate the different subgroups' dietary requirements, thereby enabling better dietary recommendations and interventions. The hope is that we will be able to subcategorize people into ever-smaller groups that can be targeted in terms of recommendations, but we will never achieve this at the individual level, thus, the choice of precision nutrition rather than personalized nutrition to designate this new field. This review focuses mainly on genetically related sources of metabolic heterogeneity and identifies challenges that need to be overcome to achieve a full understanding of the complex interactions between the many sources of metabolic heterogeneity that make people differ from one another in their requirements for and responses to foods.

31911549,Combined MEK and PI3K/p110β Inhibition as a Novel Targeted Therapy for Malignant Mesothelioma Displaying Sarcomatoid Features.,"Among malignant mesotheliomas (MM), the sarcomatoid subtype is associated with higher chemoresistance and worst survival. Due to its low incidence, there has been little progress in the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms associated with sarcomatoid MM, which might help to define novel therapeutic targets. In this work, we show that loss of PTEN expression is frequent in human sarcomatoid MM and PTEN expression levels are lower in sarcomatoid MM than in the biphasic and epithelioid subtypes. Combined <i>Pten</i> and <i>Trp53</i> deletion in mouse mesothelium led to nonepithelioid MM development. In <i>Pten;Trp53</i>-null mice developing MM, the Gαi2-coupled receptor subunit activated MEK/ERK and PI3K, resulting in aggressive, immune-suppressed tumors. Combined inhibition of MEK and p110β/PI3K reduced mouse tumor cell growth <i>in vitro</i>. Therapeutic inhibition of MEK and p110β/PI3K using selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) and AZD8186, two drugs that are currently in clinical trials, increased the survival of <i>Pten</i>;<i>Trp53</i>-null mice without major toxicity. This drug combination effectively reduced the proliferation of primary cultures of human pleural (Pl) MM, implicating nonepithelioid histology and high vimentin, AKT1/2, and Gαi2 expression levels as predictive markers of response to combined MEK and p110β/PI3K inhibition. Our findings provide a rationale for the use of selumetinib and AZD8186 in patients with MM with sarcomatoid features. This constitutes a novel targeted therapy for a poor prognosis and frequently chemoresistant group of patients with MM, for whom therapeutic options are currently lacking. SIGNIFICANCE: Mesothelioma is highly aggressive; its sarcomatoid variants have worse prognosis.

Six isoproteic and isolipidic experimental diets were formulated with graded levels of n-3 HUFA (0.65, 1.00, 1.35, 1.70, 2.05 and 2.40% of dry matter, respectively), and the 0.65% group was used as control group. Each diet was randomly allocated to triplicate groups of fish in 1000 L fiberglass tank, and each tank was stocked with 40 fish (initial weight 12.06 ± 0.01 g) for 8 weeks. Results showed that feed conversion ratio (FCR), survival rate (SR), hepatosomatic index (HSI) and condition factor (CF) were all not significantly affected by dietary n-3 HUFA levels (P > 0.05). Weight gain (WG) and specific growth rate (SGR) in 1.35% group were significantly higher than those in 2.40% group (P < 0.05). Crude lipid of body in 1.00% group was significantly lower than that in 1.70% and 2.40% groups (P < 0.05). Liver and muscle fatty acid profiles reflected that of diets.

After challenge with Vibrio harveyi, serum CAT, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), lysozyme (LZM) and C3 all increased sharply, while SOD showed the opposite trend. Before challenge with Vibrio harveyi, the expression levels of intestine toll-like receptor 22 (TLR22) and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) mRNA in 2.40% group were significantly increased, and the expression levels of tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) mRNA in 2.05% group were significantly higher than those in 1.00% and 1.35% groups (P < 0.05).

Eight isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets (48.61% protein and 11.17% lipid) were formulated by replacing 0% (the control), 11%, 22%, 33%, 44%, 55%, 66%, and 77% of fish meal (FM) with SPC, respectively (the eight dietary be named FM, S11, S22, S33, S44, S55, S66, and S77, respectively). With the replacement level increased, the final body weight, weight gain ratio (WGR), specific growth rate (SGR), and survival rate of fish were significantly decreased (P < 0.05) compared with the group FM. By contrast, the feed conversion ratio (FCR) of fish was significantly increased (P < 0.05) when the replacement level up to 44%. Partial FM replacement by SPC (ranging from 11% to 77%) substantially reduced (P < 0.05) the serum total protein, albumin, and total cholesterol contents compared with the group FM. Liver total superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase activities, and total antioxidant capacity showed the same trend of gradual increase first and then decrease. Their highest values were found in the replacement levels of 55%, 33%, 22%, and 55% and were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than the control group. The lowest malondialdehyde content was observed in group S77 and was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that of the control group. The complements C3 and C4 contents of fish fed with experimental diets (replacement level ranged from 11% to 66%) were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than the group FM.

To study the role of Tfr1 in hematopoiesis, we generated hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) specific Tfr1 knockout mice. We found that <i>Tfr1</i> conditional knockout mice reached full term but died within one week of birth. Further analyses revealed that <i>Tfr1</i>-deficient HSC had impaired development of all hematopoietic progenitors except thrombocytes and B lymphocytes. In addition, <i>Tfr1</i>-deficient cells had cellular iron deficiency, which blocked the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cells, attenuated the commitment of hematopoietic lineages, and reduced the regeneration potential of HSC. Notably, hemin rescued the colony-forming capacity of <i>Tfr1</i>-deficient HSC, whereas expressing a mutant Tfr1 that lacks the protein's iron-transporting capacity failed to rescue hematopoiesis. These findings provide direct evidence that Tfr1 is essential for hematopoiesis through binding diferric transferrin to supply iron to cells.",Wang S; He X; Wu Q; Jiang L; Chen L; Yu Y; Zhang P; Huang X; Wang J; Ju Z; Min J; Wang F,Haematologica,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31601687/,0,0,0,0,0,0

The full length of LvPIAS was 3065 bp, including a 2361 bp open reading frame (ORF) coding for a protein of 786 aa. LvPIAS expression was most abundant in muscle and could respond to the challenge of LPS, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphhylococcus aureus, Poly I: C and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). LvPIAS could be induced by the transcription factor LvSTAT, but LvPIAS could inhibit the transcriptional activity of LvSTAT to the LvPIAS promoter conversely, which indicated that there was a negative feedback loop between LvSTAT and LvPIAS. Furthermore, RNAi-mediated knockdown of LvPIAS shrimps showed higher survival rate to WSSV infection than those in the control group (dsGFP injection), suggesting that LvPIAS may play a negatively role against WSSV infection.",Zhang S; Li C; Wang W; Wang C; Sun C; Chan S; Shi L,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31491531/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Here, we show that inulin increases beneficial microbiota and decreases harmful microbiota in the feces of young, asymptomatic APOE4 transgenic (E4FAD) mice and enhances metabolism in the cecum, periphery and brain, as demonstrated by increases in the levels of SCFAs, tryptophan-derived metabolites, bile acids, glycolytic metabolites and scyllo-inositol. We show that inulin also reduces inflammatory gene expression in the hippocampus. This knowledge can be utilized to design early precision nutrition intervention strategies that use a prebiotic diet to enhance systemic metabolism and may be useful for reducing AD risk in asymptomatic APOE4 carriers.",Hoffman JD; Yanckello LM; Chlipala G; Hammond TC; McCulloch SD; Parikh I; Sun S; Morganti JM; Green SJ; Lin AL,PloS one,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31461505/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Studies on variations in the <i>FADS</i> genecluster provided some of the first examples for marked gene-diet interactions in modulating complex phenotypes, such as eczema, asthma, and cognition. Genotype distribution differs markedly among ethnicities, apparently reflecting an evolutionary advantage of genotypes enabling active long-chain PUFA synthesis when the introduction of agriculture provided diets rich in linoleic acid but with little arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids.

31417605,Models Integrating Genetic and Lifestyle Interactions on Two Adiposity Phenotypes for Personalized Prescription of Energy-Restricted Diets With Different Macronutrient Distribution.,"<b>Aim:</b> To analyze the influence of genetics and interactions with environmental factors on adiposity outcomes [waist circumference reduction (WCR) and total body fat loss (TFATL)] in response to energy-restricted diets in subjects with excessive body weight. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> Two hypocaloric diets (30% energy restriction) were prescribed to overweight/obese subjects during 16 weeks, which had different targeted macronutrient distribution: a low-fat (LF) diet (22% energy from lipids) and a moderately high-protein (MHP) diet (30% energy from proteins). At the end of the trial, a total of 201 participants (LF diet = 105; MHP diet = 96) who presented good/regular dietary adherence were genotyped for 95 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with weight loss through next-generation sequencing from oral samples. Four unweighted (uGRS) and four weighted (wGRS) genetic risk scores were computed using statistically relevant SNPs for each outcome by diet. Predictions of WCR and TFATL by diet were modeled through recognized multiple linear regression models including genetic (single SNPs, uGRS, and wGRS), phenotypic (age, sex, and WC, or TFAT at baseline), and environment variables (physical activity level and energy intake at baselines) as well as eventual interactions between genes and environmental factors. <b>Results:</b> Overall, 26 different SNPs were associated with differential adiposity outcomes, 9 with WCR and 17 with TFATL, most of which were specific for each dietary intervention. In addition to conventional predictors (age, sex, lifestyle, and adiposity status at baseline), the calculated uGRS/wGRS and interactions with environmental factors were major contributors of adiposity responses. Thus, variances in TFATL-LF diet, TFATL-MHP diet, WCR-LF diet, and WCR-MHP diet were predicted by approximately 38% (optimism-corrected adj. <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.3792), 32% (optimism-corrected adj. <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.3208), 22% (optimism-corrected adj. <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.2208), and 21% (optimism-corrected adj. <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.2081), respectively. <b>Conclusions:</b> Different genetic variants and interactions with environmental factors modulate the differential individual responses to MHP and LF dietary interventions. These insights and models may help to optimize personalized nutritional strategies for modeling the prevention and management of excessive adiposity through precision nutrition approaches taking into account not only genetic information but also the lifestyle/clinical factors that interplay in addition to age and sex.",Ramos-Lopez O; Riezu-Boj JI; Milagro FI; Cuervo M; Goni L; Martinez JA,Frontiers in genetics,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31417605/,0,0,0,0,0,0
31379754,"Interaction Among Sex, Aging, and Epigenetic Processes Concerning Visceral Fat, Insulin Resistance, and Dyslipidaemia.","The distribution of adipose tissue is influenced by gender and by age, shifting from subcutaneous to visceral depots with longevity, increasing the development of several aging-related diseases and manifestations such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, and insulin resistance. Epigenetics might have an important role in aging processes. The aim of this research was to investigate the interactions between aging and epigenetic processes and the role of visceral adipose tissue, insulin resistance, and dyslipidaemia. Two different study samples of 366 and 269 adult participants were analyzed. Anthropometric, biochemical (including the triglycerides-glucose (TyG) index), and blood pressure measurements were assessed following standardized methods. Body composition measurements by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were also performed for the second sample. Methylation data were assessed by Infinium Human Methylation BeadChip (Illumina) in peripheral white blood cells. Epigenetic age acceleration was calculated using the methods DNAmAge (AgeAcc) and GrimAge (AgeAccGrim). Age acceleration (AgeAccGrim) showed better correlations than AgeAcc with most of the measured variables (waist circumference, glucose, HOMA-IR, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and TyG index) for the first sample. In the second sample, all the previous correlations were confirmed, except for HOMA-IR. In addition, many of the anthropometrical measurements assessed by DXA and C-reactive protein (CRP) were also statistically associated with AgeAccGrim. Associations separated by sex showed statistically significant correlations between AgeAccGrim and HDL-cholesterol or CRP in women, whereas, in men, the association was with visceral adipose tissue mass DXA, triglycerides and TyG index. Linear regression models (model 1 included visceral adipose tissue mass DXA and TyG index and model 2 included HDL-cholesterol and CRP) showed a significant association for men concerning visceral adipose tissue mass DXA and TyG index, while HDL-cholesterol and CRP were associated in women. Moreover, structural equation modeling showed that the TyG index was mediating the majority of the visceral adipose tissue mass action on age acceleration. Collectively, these findings showed that there are different mechanisms affecting epigenetic age acceleration depending on sex. The identified relationships between epigenetic age acceleration and disease markers will contribute to the understanding of the development of age-related diseases.",Arpón A; Milagro FI; Santos JL; García-Granero M; Riezu-Boj JI; Martínez JA,Frontiers in endocrinology,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31379754/,0,0,0,0,0,0
31362796,A critical evaluation of results from genome-wide association studies of micronutrient status and their utility in the practice of precision nutrition.,"Rapid advances in 'omics' technologies have paved the way forward to an era where more 'precise' approaches - 'precision' nutrition - which leverage data on genetic variability alongside the traditional indices, have been put forth as the state-of-the-art solution to redress the effects of malnutrition across the life course. We purport that this inference is premature and that it is imperative to first review and critique the existing evidence from large-scale epidemiological findings. We set out to provide a critical evaluation of findings from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in the roadmap to precision nutrition, focusing on GWAS of micronutrient disposition. We found that a large number of loci associated with biomarkers of micronutrient status have been identified. Mean estimates of heritability of micronutrient status ranged between 20 and 35 % for minerals, 56-59 % for water-soluble and 30-70 % for fat-soluble vitamins. With some exceptions, the majority of the identified genetic variants explained little of the overall variance in status for each micronutrient, ranging between 1·3 and 8 % (minerals), <0·1-12 % (water-soluble) and 1·7-2·3 % for (fat-soluble) vitamins. However, GWAS have provided some novel insight into mechanisms that underpin variability in micronutrient status. Our findings highlight obvious gaps that need to be addressed if the full scope of precision nutrition is ever to be realised, including research aimed at (i) dissecting the genetic basis of micronutrient deficiencies or 'response' to intake/supplementation (ii) identifying trans-ethnic and ethnic-specific effects (iii) identifying gene-nutrient interactions for the purpose of unravelling molecular 'behaviour' in a range of environmental contexts.",Dib MJ; Elliott R; Ahmadi KR,The British journal of nutrition,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31362796/,0,0,0,0,0,0
31307412,A randomized controlled trial for overweight and obesity in preschoolers: the More and Less Europe study - an intervention within the STOP project.,"Childhood overweight and obesity is a serious public health issue with an increase being observed in preschool-aged children. Treating childhood obesity is difficult and few countries use standardized treatments. Therefore, there is a need to find effective approaches that are feasible for both health care providers and families. Thus, the overall aim of this study is to assess the acceptance and effectiveness of a parent support program (the More and Less, ML) for the management of overweight and obesity followed by a mobile health (mHealth) program (the MINISTOP application) in a socially diverse population of families. A two-arm, parallel design randomized controlled trial in 300 2-to 6-year-old children with overweight and obesity from Romania, Spain and Sweden (n = 100 from each). Following baseline assessments children are randomized into the intervention or control group in a 1:1 ratio. The intervention, the ML program, consists of 10-weekly group sessions which focus on evidence-based parenting practices, followed by the previously validated MINISTOP application for 6-months to support healthy eating and physical activity behaviors. The primary outcome is change in body mass index (BMI) z-score after 9-months and secondary outcomes include: waist circumference, eating behavior (Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire), parenting behavior (Comprehensive Feeding Practices Questionnaire), physical activity (ActiGraph wGT3x-BT), dietary patterns (based on metabolic markers from urine and 24 h dietary recalls), epigenetic and gut hormones (fasting blood samples), and the overall acceptance of the overweight and obesity management in young children (semi-structured interviews). Outcomes are measured at baseline and after: 10-weeks (only BMI z-score, waist circumference), 9-months (all outcomes), 15- and 21-months (all outcomes except physical activity, dietary patterns, epigenetics and gut hormones) post-baseline. This study will evaluate a parent support program for weight management in young children in three European countries. To boost the effect of the ML program the families will be supported by an app for 6-months. If the program is found to be effective, it has the potential to be implemented into routine care to reduce overweight and obesity in young children and the app could prove to be a viable option for sustained effects of the care provided.

Here, we show an important role for iron in inducing cyclin E and B cell proliferation. We find that iron-deficient individuals exhibit a significantly reduced antibody response to the measles vaccine when compared to iron-normal controls. Mice with iron deficiency also exhibit attenuated T-dependent or T-independent antigen-specific antibody responses. We show that iron is essential for B cell proliferation; both iron deficiency and α-ketoglutarate inhibition could suppress cyclin E1 induction and S phase entry of B cells upon activation. Finally, we demonstrate that three demethylases, KDM2B, KDM3B and KDM4C, are responsible for histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) demethylation at the cyclin E1 promoter, cyclin E1 induction and B cell proliferation. Thus, our data reveal a crucial role of H3K9 demethylation in B cell proliferation, and the importance of iron in humoral immunity.",Jiang Y; Li C; Wu Q; An P; Huang L; Wang J; Chen C; Chen X; Zhang F; Ma L; Liu S; He H; Xie S; Sun Y; Liu H; Zhan Y; Tao Y; Liu Z; Sun X; Hu Y; Wang Q; Ye D; Zhang J; Zou S; Wang Y; Wei G; Liu Y; Shi Y; Eugene Chin Y; Hao Y; Wang F; Zhang X,Nature communications,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31270335/,0,0,0,0,0,0
31252674,Precision Nutrition and the Microbiome Part II: Potential Opportunities and Pathways to Commercialisation.,"Modulation of the human gut microbiota through probiotics, prebiotics and dietary fibre are recognised strategies to improve health and prevent disease. Yet we are only beginning to understand the impact of these interventions on the gut microbiota and the physiological consequences for the human host, thus forging the way towards evidence-based scientific validation. However, in many studies a percentage of participants can be defined as 'non-responders' and scientists are beginning to unravel what differentiates these from 'responders;' and it is now clear that an individual's baseline microbiota can influence an individual's response. Thus, microbiome composition can potentially serve as a biomarker to predict responsiveness to interventions, diets and dietary components enabling greater opportunities for its use towards disease prevention and health promotion. In Part I of this two-part review, we reviewed the current state of the science in terms of the gut microbiota and the role of diet and dietary components in shaping it and subsequent consequences for human health. In Part II, we examine the efficacy of gut-microbiota modulating therapies at different life stages and their potential to aid in the management of undernutrition and overnutrition. Given the significance of an individual's gut microbiota, we investigate the feasibility of microbiome testing and we discuss guidelines for evaluating the scientific validity of evidence for providing personalised microbiome-based dietary advice.

31225587,The Role of the Gut Microbiome in Predicting Response to Diet and the Development of Precision Nutrition Models. Part II: Results.,"The gut microbiota is increasingly implicated in the health and metabolism of its human host. The host's diet is a major component influencing the composition and function of the gut microbiota, and mounting evidence suggests that the composition and function of the gut microbiota influence the host's metabolic response to diet. This effect of the gut microbiota on personalized dietary response is a growing focus of precision nutrition research and may inform the effort to tailor dietary advice to the individual. Because the gut microbiota has been shown to be malleable to some extent, it may also allow for therapeutic alterations of the gut microbiota in order to alter response to certain dietary components. This article is the second in a 2-part review of the current research in the field of precision nutrition incorporating the gut microbiota into studies investigating interindividual variability in response to diet.

31212707,Methylome-Wide Association Study in Peripheral White Blood Cells Focusing on Central Obesity and Inflammation.,"Epigenetic signatures such as DNA methylation may be associated with specific obesity traits in different tissues. The onset and development of some obesity-related complications are often linked to visceral fat accumulation. The aim of this study was to explore DNA methylation levels in peripheral white blood cells to identify epigenetic methylation marks associated with waist circumference (WC). DNA methylation levels were assessed using Infinium Human Methylation 450K and MethylationEPIC beadchip (Illumina) to search for putative associations with WC values of 473 participants from the Methyl Epigenome Network Association (MENA) project. Statistical analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) were employed for assessing the relationship between methylation and WC. A total of 669 CpGs were statistically associated with WC (FDR < 0.05, slope ≥ |0.1|). From these CpGs, 375 CpGs evidenced a differential methylation pattern between females with WC ≤ 88 and > 88 cm, and 95 CpGs between males with WC ≤ 102 and > 102 cm. These differentially methylated CpGs are located in genes related to inflammation and obesity according to IPA. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of the top four significant differentially methylated CpGs separated by sex discriminated individuals with presence or absence of abdominal fat. ROC curves of all the CpGs from females and one CpG from males were validated in an independent sample (<i>n =</i> 161).

31208038,Insulin Sensitivity Is Associated with Lipoprotein Lipase (<i>LPL</i>) and Catenin Delta 2 (<i>CTNND2</i>) DNA Methylation in Peripheral White Blood Cells in Non-Diabetic Young Women.,"Hyperglycaemia and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are associated with impaired insulin secretion and/or insulin action. Since few studies have addressed the relation between DNA methylation patterns with elaborated surrogates of insulin secretion/sensitivity based on the intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT), the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between DNA methylation and an insulin sensitivity index based on IVGTT (calculated insulin sensitivity index (CSi)) in peripheral white blood cells from 57 non-diabetic female volunteers. The CSi and acute insulin response (AIR) indexes, as well as the disposition index (DI = CSi × AIR), were estimated from abbreviated IVGTT in 49 apparently healthy Chilean women. Methylation levels were assessed using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450k BeadChip. After a statistical probe filtering, the two top CpGs whose methylation was associated with CSi were cg04615668 and cg07263235, located in the catenin delta 2 (<i>CTNND2</i>) and lipoprotein lipase (<i>LPL</i>) genes, respectively. Both CpGs conjointly predicted insulin sensitivity status with an area under the curve of 0.90. Additionally, cg04615668 correlated with homeostasis model assessment insulin-sensitivity (HOMA-S) and AIR, whereas cg07263235 was associated with plasma creatinine and DI. These results add further insights into the epigenetic regulation of insulin sensitivity and associated complications, pointing the <i>CTNND2</i> and <i>LPL</i> genes as potential underlying epigenetic biomarkers for future risk of insulin-related diseases.",Arpón A; Santos JL; Milagro FI; Cataldo LR; Bravo C; Riezu-Boj JI; Martínez JA,International journal of molecular sciences,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31208038/,0,0,0,0,0,0
31022973,"Precision Nutrition and the Microbiome, Part I: Current State of the Science.","The gut microbiota is a highly complex community which evolves and adapts to its host over a lifetime. It has been described as a virtual organ owing to the myriad of functions it performs, including the production of bioactive metabolites, regulation of immunity, energy homeostasis and protection against pathogens. These activities are dependent on the quantity and quality of the microbiota alongside its metabolic potential, which are dictated by a number of factors, including diet and host genetics. In this regard, the gut microbiome is malleable and varies significantly from host to host. These two features render the gut microbiome a candidate 'organ' for the possibility of precision microbiomics - the use of the gut microbiome as a biomarker to predict responsiveness to specific dietary constituents to generate precision diets and interventions for optimal health. With this in mind, this two-part review investigates the current state of the science in terms of the influence of diet and specific dietary components on the gut microbiota and subsequent consequences for health status, along with opportunities to modulate the microbiota for improved health and the potential of the microbiome as a biomarker to predict responsiveness to dietary components. In particular, in Part I, we examine the development of the microbiota from birth and its role in health.

There is suggestive evidence that environmental stimuli, such as dietary pattern, particularly during pregnancy and early life, but also in adult life, can induce changes in DNA methylation predisposing to obesity and related comorbidities. In this context, the DNA methylation marks of each individual have emerged not only as a promising tool for the prediction, screening, diagnosis, and prognosis of obesity and metabolic syndrome features, but also for the improvement of weight loss therapies in the context of precision nutrition. The main objectives in this field are to understand the mechanisms involved in transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, and featuring the nutritional and lifestyle factors implicated in the epigenetic modifications.

30878492,Primers on nutrigenetics and nutri(epi)genomics: Origins and development of precision nutrition.,"Understanding the relationship between genotype and phenotype is a central goal not just for genetics but also for medicine and biological sciences. Despite outstanding technological progresses, genetics alone is not able to completely explain phenotypes, in particular for complex diseases. Given the existence of a ""missing heritability"", growing attention has been given to non-mendelian mechanisms of inheritance and to the role of the environment. The study of interaction between gene and environment represents a challenging but also a promising field with high potential for health prevention, and epigenetics has been suggested as one of the best candidate to mediate environmental effects on the genome. Among environmental factors able to interact with both genome and epigenome, nutrition is one of the most impacting. Not just our genome influences the responsiveness to food and nutrients, but vice versa, nutrition can also modify gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms. In this complex picture, nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics represent appealing disciplines aimed to define new prospectives of personalized nutrition.

30788696,Nutritional regulation of pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase at the enzymatic and molecular levels in cobia Rachycentron canadum.,"Despite being a carnivorous fish species, cobia (Rachycentron canadum) can utilize high levels of dietary carbohydrate (up to 360 g kg<sup>-1</sup>). By contrast, rainbow trout (also carnivorous) cannot, due to the absence of molecular induction of glycolytic enzyme and inhibition of gluconeogenic enzyme gene expressions such as pyruvate kinase (PK) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). We hypothesized that this phenomenon is species-specific and will not be observed in cobia. Our results show that, at the molecular level, the mRNA abundance of the important glycolytic (PK) and gluconeogenic (PEPCK) enzymes in cobia liver are regulated by dietary carbohydrate-to-lipid (CHO:L) ratios and nutritional status (fed, unfed, and refed). Significantly upregulated hepatic PK and depressed PEPCK gene expressions were observed when the fish were fed with an increasing CHO/L-ratio diet or were refed. However, in contrast to gene expression, there was no significant effect of dietary CHO/L ratios on PK enzyme activity. The decrease in PEPCK activity was significantly found between low CHO/L ratio and high CHO/L ratio diets, whereas the moderate CHO/L ratio group showed intermediate values. But PEPCK activity appeared to be independent of nutritional status. These results suggest that nutritional regulation is obvious, at least at the molecular level, in the key hepatic enzymes (PK and PEPCK) of the glucose metabolism pathway, in response to different dietary CHO/L ratios and to the transition from being starved to fed. Determining whether other key enzymes involved in hepatic glucose metabolism contribute to glucose tolerance in cobia is necessary for further investigation of this phenomenon at the enzymatic and molecular levels.",Li R; Liu H; Li S; Tan B; Dong X; Chi S; Yang Q; Zhang S; Chen L,Fish physiology and biochemistry,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30788696/,0,0,0,0,0,0
30692261,Ferroptosis as a target for protection against cardiomyopathy.,"Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. A key pathogenic factor in the development of lethal heart failure is loss of terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes. However, mechanisms of cardiomyocyte death remain unclear. Here, we discovered and demonstrated that ferroptosis, a programmed iron-dependent cell death, as a mechanism in murine models of doxorubicin (DOX)- and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced cardiomyopathy. In canonical apoptosis and/or necroptosis-defective <i>Ripk3</i><sup>-/-</sup>, <i>Mlkl</i><sup>-/-</sup>, or <i>Fadd</i><sup>-/-</sup><i>Mlkl</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice, DOX-treated cardiomyocytes showed features of typical ferroptotic cell death. Consistently, compared with dexrazoxane, the only FDA-approved drug for treating DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, inhibition of ferroptosis by ferrostatin-1 significantly reduced DOX cardiomyopathy. RNA-sequencing results revealed that heme oxygenase-1 (<i>Hmox1</i>) was significantly up-regulated in DOX-treated murine hearts. Administering DOX to mice induced cardiomyopathy with a rapid, systemic accumulation of nonheme iron via heme degradation by Nrf2-mediated up-regulation of Hmox1, which effect was abolished in <i>Nrf2</i>-deficent mice. Conversely, zinc protoporphyrin IX, an Hmox1 antagonist, protected the DOX-treated mice, suggesting free iron released on heme degradation is necessary and sufficient to induce cardiac injury. Given that ferroptosis is driven by damage to lipid membranes, we further investigated and found that excess free iron accumulated in mitochondria and caused lipid peroxidation on its membrane. Mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoTEMPO significantly rescued DOX cardiomyopathy, supporting oxidative damage of mitochondria as a major mechanism in ferroptosis-induced heart damage. Importantly, ferrostatin-1 and iron chelation also ameliorated heart failure induced by both acute and chronic I/R in mice. These findings highlight that targeting ferroptosis serves as a cardioprotective strategy for cardiomyopathy prevention.",Fang X; Wang H; Han D; Xie E; Yang X; Wei J; Gu S; Gao F; Zhu N; Yin X; Cheng Q; Zhang P; Dai W; Chen J; Yang F; Yang HT; Linkermann A; Gu W; Min J; Wang F,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30692261/,0,0,0,0,0,0
30581653,Nutritional Genomics of Cardiovascular Disease.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States and globally. There is significant evidence implicating genetic and dietary factors in the development and progression of CVD and its risk factors. Nutritional genomics is a comparatively new field of science that focuses on the relationship of individual genetic variation with response to nutrition. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent progress, in the field of nutritional genomics as it relates to cardiovascular disease. Evidence from recent studies has shown significant effects of gene-diet interactions on CVD biomarkers and the development and progression of CVD. The cardiovascular effects of gene-nutrient interactions with respect to macronutrients and genes such as <i>FTO, ACE, PPARs, TCF7L2, BDNF</i>, <i>MC4R, APOAs</i>, <i>FADS</i>, etc. have shown consistent results across age groups and populations whereas gene-nutrient interaction effects of other genes have only been limited to specific ages, genders or populations and need to validated and confirmed. The identification of individual genetic variation influencing diet-related CVD risk is important and may inform future nutritional intervention studies. Although there is ample scientific evidence indicating that the genetic susceptibility to CVD can be modified by diet, we are still not at a stage where this information is easily translated into dietary plans. Thus, there is a need for better approaches to achieve precision in dietary data collection and streamline computational approaches for meaningful and effective nutritional interventions.",Voruganti VS,Current genetic medicine reports,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30581653/,0,0,0,0,0,0
30577445,A Guide to Applying the Sex-Gender Perspective to Nutritional Genomics.,"Precision nutrition aims to make dietary recommendations of a more personalized nature possible, to optimize the prevention or delay of a disease and to improve health. Therefore, the characteristics (including sex) of an individual have to be taken into account as well as a series of omics markers. The results of nutritional genomics studies are crucial to generate the evidence needed so that precision nutrition can be applied. Although sex is one of the fundamental variables for making recommendations, at present, the nutritional genomics studies undertaken have not analyzed, systematically and with a gender perspective, the heterogeneity/homogeneity in gene-diet interactions on the different phenotypes studied, thus there is little information available on this issue and needs to be improved. Here we argue for the need to incorporate the gender perspective in nutritional genomics studies, present the general context, analyze the differences between sex and gender, as well as the limitations to measuring them and to detecting specific sex-gene or sex-phenotype associations, both at the specific gene level or in genome-wide-association studies. We analyzed the main sex-specific gene-diet interactions published to date and their main limitations and present guidelines with recommendations to be followed when undertaking new nutritional genomics studies incorporating the gender perspective.",Corella D; Coltell O; Portolés O; Sotos-Prieto M; Fernández-Carrión R; Ramirez-Sabio JB; Zanón-Moreno V; Mattei J; Sorlí JV; Ordovas JM,Nutrients,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30577445/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30553801,Addressing the Nutritional Phenotype Through Personalized Nutrition for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management.,"The primary focus of public health recommendations related to the prevention of food-related chronic disease has been on the adoption of healthy dietary patterns; however, implementation has been challenging. There has been increasing recognition that an individual's diet and environment may impact disease susceptibility by affecting the expression of genes involved in critical metabolic pathways. Precision nutrition (PN) has emerged to translate discoveries about diversity in nutrient metabolism between subgroups and the inter-individual variability in the responses to dietary interventions. The overarching goals of PN are to deliver individualized, actionable dietary therapy based on an individual's nutritional phenotype, created from the integration of genetics, metabolic profile, and environmental factors in order to prevent and treat chronic disease. This review addresses the developments of genome- and omic-driven PN and how they have been used to prevent and treat disease, as well as how they might be integrated into broader clinical practice.",Laddu D; Hauser M,Progress in cardiovascular diseases,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30553801/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30537927,Survival marker genes of colorectal cancer derived from consistent transcriptomic profiling.,"Identification of biomarkers associated with the prognosis of different cancer subtypes is critical to achieve better therapeutic assistance. In colorectal cancer (CRC) the discovery of stable and consistent survival markers remains a challenge due to the high heterogeneity of this class of tumors. In this work, we identified a new set of gene markers for CRC associated to prognosis and risk using a large unified cohort of patients with transcriptomic profiles and survival information. We built an integrated dataset with 1273 human colorectal samples, which provides a homogeneous robust framework to analyse genome-wide expression and survival data. Using this dataset we identified two sets of genes that are candidate prognostic markers for CRC in stages III and IV, showing either up-regulation correlated with poor prognosis or up-regulation correlated with good prognosis. The top 10 up-regulated genes found as survival markers of poor prognosis (i.e. low survival) were: DCBLD2, PTPN14, LAMP5, TM4SF1, NPR3, LEMD1, LCA5, CSGALNACT2, SLC2A3 and GADD45B. The stability and robustness of the gene survival markers was assessed by cross-validation, and the best-ranked genes were also validated with two external independent cohorts: one of microarrays with 482 samples; another of RNA-seq with 269 samples. Up-regulation of the top genes was also proved in a comparison with normal colorectal tissue samples. Finally, the set of top 100 genes that showed overexpression correlated with low survival was used to build a CRC risk predictor applying a multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. This risk predictor yielded an optimal separation of the individual patients of the cohort according to their survival, with a p-value of 8.25e-14 and Hazard Ratio 2.14 (95% CI: 1.75-2.61). The results presented in this work provide a solid rationale for the prognostic utility of a new set of genes in CRC, demonstrating their potential to predict colorectal tumor progression and evolution towards poor survival stages. Our study does not provide a fixed gene signature for prognosis and risk prediction, but instead proposes a robust set of genes ranked according to their predictive power that can be selected for additional tests with other CRC clinical cohorts.",Martinez-Romero J; Bueno-Fortes S; Martín-Merino M; Ramirez de Molina A; De Las Rivas J,BMC genomics,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30537927/,0,0,0,0,0,0
30518135,Vitamin E Metabolic Effects and Genetic Variants: A Challenge for Precision Nutrition in Obesity and Associated Disturbances.,"Vitamin E (VE) has a recognized leading role as a contributor to the protection of cell constituents from oxidative damage. However, evidence suggests that the health benefits of VE go far beyond that of an antioxidant acting in lipophilic environments. In humans, VE is channeled toward pathways dealing with lipoproteins and cholesterol, underlining its relevance in lipid handling and metabolism. In this context, both VE intake and status may be relevant in physiopathological conditions associated with disturbances in lipid metabolism or concomitant with oxidative stress, such as obesity. However, dietary reference values for VE in obese populations have not yet been defined, and VE supplementation trials show contradictory results. Therefore, a better understanding of the role of genetic variants in genes involved in VE metabolism may be crucial to exert dietary recommendations with a higher degree of precision. In particular, genetic variability should be taken into account in targets concerning VE bioavailability per se or concomitant with impaired lipoprotein transport. Genetic variants associated with impaired VE liver balance, and the handling/resolution of oxidative stress might also be relevant, but the core information that exists at present is insufficient to deliver precise recommendations.",Galmés S; Serra F; Palou A,Nutrients,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30518135/,1,0,0,0,0,0
30428511,The Intracellular Free Zinc Level Is Vital for Treg Function and a Feasible Tool to Discriminate between Treg and Activated Th Cells.,"The intracellular free zinc level and zinc distribution are important for cellular function. Both are highly variable and are altered due to intrinsic zinc pool fluctuation via buffering and muffling reactions. Multiple autoimmune diseases are associated with pathologically changed zinc levels, which provoke altered signal transduction leading to changed immune responses, cell differentiation, and function. For instance, immunological tolerance can be impaired, causing autoimmune diseases because of a malfunction of regulatory T cells (Tregs). We investigated the intracellular free zinc concentration of resting and activated T helper (Th) cells and Tregs in an allogeneic graft versus host disease model using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis and enlightened cell function under nontoxic zinc concentrations and zinc deficiency by detecting cytokine secretion via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We exhibited for the first time that Tregs could be explicitly discriminated from other Th cell subsets using significantly increased intracellular free zinc levels. Moreover, the intracellular free zinc level was essential in maintaining the Treg phenotype and function, since zinc deficiency favored the pro-inflammatory immune response. Therefore, we hypothesize that the intracellular free zinc level in Th cells is essential in guaranteeing proper cellular function and can be used to discriminate Tregs from other Th cell subsets.",Maywald M; Wang F; Rink L,International journal of molecular sciences,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30428511/,0,0,0,0,0,0
30340375,"Bitter, Sweet, Salty, Sour and Umami Taste Perception Decreases with Age: Sex-Specific Analysis, Modulation by Genetic Variants and Taste-Preference Associations in 18 to 80 Year-Old Subjects.","There is growing interest in relating taste perception to diet and healthy aging. However, there is still limited information on the influence of age, sex and genetics on taste acuity as well as on the relationship between taste perception and taste preferences. We have analysed the influence of age on the intensity rating of the five basic tastes: sweet, salty, bitter, sour and umami (separately and jointly in a ""total taste score"") and their modulation by sex and genetics in a relatively healthy population (men and women) aged 18⁻80 years (<i>n</i> = 1020 Caucasian European participants). Taste perception was determined by challenging subjects with solutions of the five basic tastes using standard prototypical tastants (6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP), NaCl, sucrose, monopotassium glutamate and citric acid) at 5 increasing concentrations (I to V). We also measured taste preferences and determined the polymorphisms of the genes taste 2 receptor member 38 (TAS2R38), taste 1 receptor member 2 (TAS2R38) and sodium channel epithelial 1 beta subunit (SCNN1B), as TAS2R38-rs713598, TAS1R2-rs35874116 and SCNN1B-rs239345 respectively. We found a statistically significant decrease in taste perception (""total taste score"") with increasing age for all the concentrations analysed. This association was stronger for the higher concentrations (<i>p</i> = 0.028; <i>p</i> = 0.012; <i>p</i> = 0.005; <i>p</i> = 4.20 × 10<sup>-5</sup> and <i>p</i> = 1.48 × 10<sup>-7</sup>, for I to V in the multivariable-adjusted models). When we analysed taste qualities (using concentration V), the intensity rating of all the 5 tastes was diminished with age (<i>p <</i> 0.05 for all). This inverse association differed depending on the test quality, being higher for bitter (PROP) and sour. Women perceived taste significantly more intense than men (<i>p</i> = 1.4 × 10<sup>-8</sup> for total taste score). However, there were differences depending on the taste, umami being the lowest (<i>p</i> = 0.069). There was a complex association between the ability to perceive a taste and the preference for the same. Significant associations were, nevertheless, found between a higher perception of sour taste and a higher preference for it in women. In contrast, the higher perception of sweet was significantly associated with a higher preference for bitter in both, men and women. The TAS2R38-rs713598 was strongly associated with bitter (PROP) taste (<i>p</i> = 1.38 × 10<sup>-50</sup>), having a significant interaction with sex (<i>p</i> = 0.030). The TAS1R2-rs35874116 was not significantly associated with sweet, whereas the SCNN1B-rs239345 was associated (<i>p</i> = 0.040) with salty taste. In conclusion, the inverse association between age and perceived taste intensity as well as the additional influence of sex and some genetic polymorphisms give rise to large inter-individual differences in taste perception and taste preferences that should be taken into account in future studies and for applications in precision nutrition for healthy aging.",Barragán R; Coltell O; Portolés O; Asensio EM; Sorlí JV; Ortega-Azorín C; González JI; Sáiz C; Fernández-Carrión R; Ordovas JM; Corella D,Nutrients,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30340375/,0,0,0,0,0,0

30295789,"Adult-Onset Hepatocyte GH Resistance Promotes NASH in Male Mice, Without Severe Systemic Metabolic Dysfunction.","Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which includes nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is associated with reduced GH input/signaling, and GH therapy is effective in the reduction/resolution of NAFLD/NASH in selected patient populations. Our laboratory has focused on isolating the direct vs indirect effects of GH in preventing NAFLD/NASH. We reported that chow-fed, adult-onset, hepatocyte-specific, GH receptor knockdown (aHepGHRkd) mice rapidly (within 7 days) develop steatosis associated with increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL), independent of changes in systemic metabolic function. In this study, we report that 6 months after induction of aHepGHRkd early signs of NASH develop, which include hepatocyte ballooning, inflammation, signs of mild fibrosis, and elevated plasma alanine aminotransferase. These changes occur in the presence of enhanced systemic lipid utilization, without evidence of white adipose tissue lipolysis, indicating that the liver injury that develops after aHepGHRkd is due to hepatocyte-specific loss of GH signaling and not due to secondary defects in systemic metabolic function. Specifically, enhanced hepatic DNL is sustained with age in aHepGHRkd mice, associated with increased hepatic markers of lipid uptake/re-esterification. Because hepatic DNL is a hallmark of NAFLD/NASH, these studies suggest that enhancing hepatocyte GH signaling could represent an effective therapeutic target to reduce DNL and treat NASH.",Cordoba-Chacon J; Sarmento-Cabral A; Del Rio-Moreno M; Diaz-Ruiz A; Subbaiah PV; Kineman RD,Endocrinology,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30295789/,0,0,0,0,0,0
30122198,Zinc transporter SLC39A11 polymorphisms are associated with chronic gastritis in the Korean population: the possible effect on spicy food intake.,"Herein, we hypothesized that ZIP11 variants would be important risk factors for chronic gastritis and that there would be an interaction effect of the relationship between their variants and spicy food intake on the development of chronic gastritis. Participants in this cross-sectional study (n = 3882 + 252) were recruited from a cohort of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study in 2001. Age, sex, education, smoking and drinking status, exercise, stress, and income level of all participants were determined by a questionnaire. Demographic and anthropometric data were collected. Fasting blood samples were collected to determine the serum levels of glucose, insulin, total bilirubin, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. The presence of chronic gastritis was defined as a confirmed diagnosis by a physician. Food consumption was determined using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. We found 8 different single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are significantly different between subjects without gastritis and those with gastritis. Of these 8 SNPs, 3 SNP (rs17183225 [C/T], rs17780814 [A/C], and rs17780820 [A/G]) are closely located in the intronic region of zinc transporter SLC39A11, commonly known as ZIP11, and show linkage disequilibrium (D' = 1.0). We also found that participants with (TCA + TCG) haplotype of ZIP11 at high levels of dietary intake of spicy foods show a significantly increasing tendency in the odds of having chronic gastritis when compared with those with CAA haplotype (odds ratio, 2.620; 95% confidence interval, 1.207-5.689). The data indicate positive associations between higher meal frequency and lower spicy food preference and gastritis. In conclusion, we found that zinc transporter gene ZIP11 is associated with chronic gastritis in the Korean population and it may interact with spicy food, which suggests ZIP11 as a therapeutic target for precision nutrition.",Ha E; Bae JH,"Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)",2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30122198/,0,0,0,0,0,0
30021836,Sirt1 protects from K-Ras-driven lung carcinogenesis.,"The NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 can be oncogenic or tumor suppressive depending on the tissue. Little is known about the role of SIRT1 in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), one of the deadliest cancers, that is frequently associated with mutated K-RAS Therefore, we investigated the effect of SIRT1 on K-RAS-driven lung carcinogenesis. We report that SIRT1 protein levels are downregulated by oncogenic K-RAS in a MEK and PI3K-dependent manner in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), and in human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. Furthermore, Sirt1 overexpression in mice delays the appearance of K-Ras<sup>G12V</sup>-driven lung adenocarcinomas, reducing the number and size of carcinomas at the time of death and extending survival. Consistently, lower levels of SIRT1 are associated with worse prognosis in human NSCLCs. Mechanistically, analysis of mouse Sirt1-Tg pneumocytes, isolated shortly after K-Ras<sup>G12V</sup> activation, reveals that Sirt1 overexpression alters pathways involved in tumor development: proliferation, apoptosis, or extracellular matrix organization. Our work demonstrates a tumor suppressive role of SIRT1 in the development of K-RAS-driven lung adenocarcinomas in mice and humans, suggesting that the SIRT1-K-RAS axis could be a therapeutic target for NSCLCs.",Costa-Machado LF; Martín-Hernández R; Sanchez-Luengo MÁ; Hess K; Vales-Villamarin C; Barradas M; Lynch C; de la Nava D; Diaz-Ruiz A; de Cabo R; Cañamero M; Martinez L; Sanchez-Carbayo M; Herranz D; Serrano M; Fernandez-Marcos PJ,EMBO reports,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30021836/,0,0,0,0,0,0
29954131,Intake of Dietary One-Carbon Metabolism-Related B Vitamins and the Risk of Esophageal Cancer: A Dose-Response Meta-Analysis.,"Several B vitamins are essential in the one-carbon metabolism pathway, which is central to DNA methylation, synthesis, and repair. Moreover, an imbalance in this pathway has been linked to certain types of cancers. Here, we performed a meta-analysis in order to investigate the relationship between the intake of four dietary one-carbon metabolism-related B vitamins (B2, B6, folate, and B12) and the risk of esophageal cancer (EC). We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase for relevant studies published through 1 March 2018. The odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the highest versus the lowest level of each dietary B vitamin was then calculated. From 21 articles reporting 26 studies including 6404 EC cases and 504,550 controls, we found an inverse correlation between the consumption of vitamin B6 and folate and the risk of EC; this association was specific to the US, Europe, and Australia, but was not found in Asia. A dose-response analysis revealed that each 100 &mu;g/day increase in folate intake reduced the risk of EC by 12%. Moreover, each 1 mg/day increase in vitamin B6 intake decreased the risk of EC by 16%. Surprisingly, we found that each 1 &mu;g/day increase in vitamin B12 intake increased the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma by 2%, particularly in the US and Europe, suggesting both geographic and histological differences. Together, our results suggest that an increased intake of one-carbon metabolism-related B vitamins may protect against EC, with the exception of vitamin B12, which should be consumed in moderation.",Qiang Y; Li Q; Xin Y; Fang X; Tian Y; Ma J; Wang J; Wang Q; Zhang R; Wang J; Wang F,Nutrients,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29954131/,1,0,0,1,0,0
29925515,Change in Inflammatory Biomarkers and Adipose Tissue in <i>BRCA1/2</i><sup>+</sup> Breast Cancer Survivors Following a Yearlong Lifestyle Modification Program.,"Breast cancer survivors who carry a genetic mutation for one of the <i>BRCA</i> genes often undergo surgically induced menopause a decade or more before the usual age of natural menopause. These women are at elevated risk for multiple negative health outcomes, including metabolic diseases, heart disease, and cancer recurrence. Effects of a 12-month commercially available web-based lifestyle program (Precision Nutrition) were tested on body composition and markers of inflammation in a randomized controlled trial. Participants (<i>N</i> = 35) were <i>BRCA1/2</i><sup>+</sup>, breast cancer survivors, and had completed surgically induced menopause at age <45 years. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to quantify body composition. Fasting blood samples were used to assay insulin, IL1β, IL6, IL8, and TNFα. At baseline, we observed relationships between insulin, TNFα, and IL6, and between biomarkers and adiposity. Insulin and subcutaneous adipose tissue levels significantly decreased following the intervention compared with the change in the control group. Compared with baseline, TNFα and total adipose tissue levels decreased significantly in the intervention group. The percent change in insulin levels was moderately correlated with the percent change in subcutaneous adipose tissue (<i>r</i> = 0.33). Change in adiposity was not related to change in TNFα or IL6. Women in the intervention group decreased levels of subcutaneous, but not visceral, adipose tissue. The change in subcutaneous adipose tissue was the main driver of change in insulin levels for the women in the intervention group. However, the change in body composition achieved by the Precision Nutrition program was not sufficient to alter biomarker levels of inflammation. <i>Cancer Prev Res; 11(9); 545-50. ©2018 AACR</i>.",Sturgeon KM; Foo W; Heroux M; Schmitz K,"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29925515/,0,0,0,0,1,0
29706024,"Overexpression of CYB5R3 and NQO1, two NAD<sup>+</sup> -producing enzymes, mimics aspects of caloric restriction.","Calorie restriction (CR) is one of the most robust means to improve health and survival in model organisms. CR imposes a metabolic program that leads to increased stress resistance and delayed onset of chronic diseases, including cancer. In rodents, CR induces the upregulation of two NADH-dehydrogenases, namely NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (Nqo1) and cytochrome b<sub>5</sub> reductase 3 (Cyb5r3), which provide electrons for energy metabolism. It has been proposed that this upregulation may be responsible for some of the beneficial effects of CR, and defects in their activity are linked to aging and several age-associated diseases. However, it is unclear whether changes in metabolic homeostasis solely through upregulation of these NADH-dehydrogenases have a positive impact on health and survival. We generated a mouse that overexpresses both metabolic enzymes leading to phenotypes that resemble aspects of CR including a modest increase in lifespan, greater physical performance, a decrease in chronic inflammation, and, importantly, protection against carcinogenesis, one of the main hallmarks of CR. Furthermore, these animals showed an enhancement of metabolic flexibility and a significant upregulation of the NAD<sup>+</sup> /sirtuin pathway.

29575577,Smad7 deficiency decreases iron and haemoglobin through hepcidin up-regulation by multilayer compensatory mechanisms.,"To maintain iron homoeostasis, the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin is tightly controlled by BMP-Smad signalling pathway, but the physiological role of Smad7 in hepcidin regulation remains elusive. We generated and characterized hepatocyte-specific Smad7 knockout mice (Smad7<sup>Alb/Alb</sup> ), which showed decreased serum iron, tissue iron, haemoglobin concentration, up-regulated hepcidin and increased phosphor-Smad1/5/8 levels in both isolated primary hepatocytes and liver tissues. Increased levels of hepcidin lead to reduced expression of intestinal ferroportin and mild iron deficiency anaemia. Interestingly, we found no difference in hepcidin expression or phosphor-Smad1/5/8 levels between iron-challenged Smad7<sup>Alb/Alb</sup> and Smad7<sup>flox/flox</sup> , suggesting other factors assume the role of iron-induced hepcidin regulation in Smad7 deletion. We performed RNA-seq to identify differentially expressed genes in the liver. Significantly up-regulated genes were then mapped to pathways, revealing TGF-β signalling as one of the most relevant pathways, including the up-regulated genes Smad6, Bambi and Fst (Follistatin). We found that Smad6 and Bambi-but not Follistatin-are controlled by the iron-BMP-Smad pathway. Overexpressing Smad6, Bambi or Follistatin in cells significantly reduced hepcidin expression. Smad7 functions as a key regulator of iron homoeostasis by negatively controlling hepcidin expression, and Smad6 and Smad7 have non-redundant roles.

29433995,Precision nutrition for prevention and management of type 2 diabetes.,"Precision nutrition aims to prevent and manage chronic diseases by tailoring dietary interventions or recommendations to one or a combination of an individual's genetic background, metabolic profile, and environmental exposures. Recent advances in genomics, metabolomics, and gut microbiome technologies have offered opportunities as well as challenges in the use of precision nutrition to prevent and manage type 2 diabetes. Nutrigenomics studies have identified genetic variants that influence intake and metabolism of specific nutrients and predict individuals' variability in response to dietary interventions. Metabolomics has revealed metabolomic fingerprints of food and nutrient consumption and uncovered new metabolic pathways that are potentially modified by diet. Dietary interventions have been successful in altering abundance, composition, and activity of gut microbiota that are relevant for food metabolism and glycaemic control. In addition, mobile apps and wearable devices facilitate real-time assessment of dietary intake and provide feedback which can improve glycaemic control and diabetes management. By integrating these technologies with big data analytics, precision nutrition has the potential to provide personalised nutrition guidance for more effective prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. Despite these technological advances, much research is needed before precision nutrition can be widely used in clinical and public health settings. Currently, the field of precision nutrition faces challenges including a lack of robust and reproducible results, the high cost of omics technologies, and methodological issues in study design as well as high-dimensional data analyses and interpretation. Evidence is needed to support the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and additional benefits of precision nutrition beyond traditional nutrition intervention approaches.

These <i>n</i>-6 and <i>n</i>-3 LC-PUFAs and their metabolites (ex, eicosanoids and endocannabinoids) play critical signaling and structural roles in almost all physiologic and pathophysiologic processes. This review summarizes: (1) the biosynthesis, metabolism and roles of LC-PUFAs; (2) the potential impact of rapidly altering the intake of dietary LA and ALA; (3) the genetics and evolution of LC-PUFA biosynthesis; (4) Gene-diet interactions that may lead to excess levels of <i>n</i>-6 LC-PUFAs and deficiencies of <i>n</i>-3 LC-PUFAs; and (5) opportunities for precision nutrition approaches to personalize <i>n</i>-3 LC-PUFA supplementation for individuals and populations.

28981199,MicroRNA-661 modulates redox and metabolic homeostasis in colon cancer.,"Cancer cell survival and metastasis are dependent on metabolic reprogramming that is capable of increasing resistance to oxidative and energetic stress. Targeting these two processes can be crucial for cancer progression. Herein, we describe the role of microRNA-661 (miR661) as epigenetic regulator of colon cancer (CC) cell metabolism. MicroR661 induces a global increase in reactive oxygen species, specifically in mitochondrial superoxide anions, which appears to be mediated by decreased carbohydrate metabolism and pentose phosphate pathway, and by a higher dependency on mitochondrial respiration. MicroR661 overexpression in non-metastatic human CC cells induces an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype, and a reduced tolerance to metabolic stress. This seems to be a general effect of miR661 in CC, since metastatic CC cell metabolism is also compromised upon miR661 overexpression. We propose hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase M2 as two key players related to the observed metabolic reprogramming. Finally, the clinical relevance of miR661 expression levels in stage-II and III CC patients is discussed. In conclusion, we propose miR661 as a potential modulator of redox and metabolic homeostasis in CC.",Gómez de Cedrón M; Acín Pérez R; Sánchez-Martínez R; Molina S; Herranz J; Feliu J; Reglero G; Enríquez JA; Ramírez de Molina A,Molecular oncology,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28981199/,0,0,0,0,0,0
28956850,Precision Nutrition for Targeting Lipid Metabolism in Colorectal Cancer.,"Cancer is a multistage and multifactorial condition with genetic and environmental factors modulating tumorogenesis and disease progression. Nevertheless, cancer is preventable, as one third of cancer deaths could be avoided by modifying key risk factors. Nutrients can directly affect fundamental cellular processes and are considered among the most important risk factors in colorectal cancer (CRC). Red and processed meat, poultry consumption, fiber, and folate are the best-known diet components that interact with colorectal cancer susceptibility. In addition, the direct association of an unhealthy diet with obesity and dysbiosis opens new routes in the understanding of how daily diet nutrients could influence cancer prognosis. In the ""omics"" era, traditional nutrition has been naturally evolved to precision nutrition where technical developments have contributed to a more accurate discipline. In this sense, genomic and transcriptomic studies have been extensively used in precision nutrition approaches. However, the relation between CRC carcinogenesis and nutrition factors is more complex than originally expected. Together with classical diet-nutrition-related genes, nowadays, lipid-metabolism-related genes have acquired relevant interest in precision nutrition studies. Lipids regulate very diverse cellular processes from ATP synthesis and the activation of essential cell-signaling pathways to membrane organization and plasticity. Therefore, a wide range of tumorogenic steps can be influenced by lipid metabolism, both in primary tumours and distal metastasis. The extent to which genetic variants, together with the intake of specific dietary components, affect the risk of CRC is currently under investigation, and new therapeutic or preventive applications must be explored in CRC models. In this review, we will go in depth into the study of co-occurring events, which orchestrate CRC tumorogenesis and are essential for the evolution of precision nutrition paradigms.

It also describes the importance of nutritional genomics concepts in personalized bariatric management. It includes a discussion of the potential role bariatric surgery plays in altering the three pillars of nutritional genomics: nutrigenetics, nutrigenomics, and epigenetics. We present studies that show the effect of each patient's genetic and epigenetic variables on the response to surgical weight loss treatment. We include investigations that demonstrate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms with obesity phenotypes and their influence on weight loss after bariatric surgery. We also present reports on how significant weight loss induced by bariatric surgery impacts telomere length, and we discuss studies on the existence of an epigenetic signature associated with surgery outcomes and specific gene methylation profile, which may help to predict weight loss after a surgical procedure. Finally, we show articles which evidence that bariatric surgery may affect expression of numerous genes involved in different metabolic pathways and consequently induce functional and taxonomic changes in gut microbial communities. The role nutritional genomics plays in responses to weight loss after bariatric surgery is evident. Better understanding of the molecular pathways involved in this process is necessary for successful weight management and maintenance.",Nicoletti CF; Cortes-Oliveira C; Pinhel MAS; Nonino CB,Nutrients,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28878180/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28829397,Precision Nutrition: A Review of Personalized Nutritional Approaches for the Prevention and Management of Metabolic Syndrome.,"The translation of the growing increase of findings emerging from basic nutritional science into meaningful and clinically relevant dietary advices represents nowadays one of the main challenges of clinical nutrition. From nutrigenomics to deep phenotyping, many factors need to be taken into account in designing personalized and unbiased nutritional solutions for individuals or population sub-groups. Likewise, a concerted effort among basic, clinical scientists and health professionals will be needed to establish a comprehensive framework allowing the implementation of these new findings at the population level. In a world characterized by an overwhelming increase in the prevalence of obesity and associated metabolic disturbances, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, tailored nutrition prescription represents a promising approach for both the prevention and management of metabolic syndrome. This review aims to discuss recent works in the field of precision nutrition analyzing most relevant aspects affecting an individual response to lifestyle/nutritional interventions. Latest advances in the analysis and monitoring of dietary habits, food behaviors, physical activity/exercise and deep phenotyping will be discussed, as well as the relevance of novel applications of nutrigenomics, metabolomics and microbiota profiling. Recent findings in the development of precision nutrition are highlighted. Finally, results from published studies providing examples of new avenues to successfully implement innovative precision nutrition approaches will be reviewed.",de Toro-Martín J; Arsenault BJ; Després JP; Vohl MC,Nutrients,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28829397/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28692648,Zebrafish slc30a10 deficiency revealed a novel compensatory mechanism of Atp2c1 in maintaining manganese homeostasis.,"Recent studies found that mutations in the human SLC30A10 gene, which encodes a manganese (Mn) efflux transporter, are associated with hypermanganesemia with dystonia, polycythemia, and cirrhosis (HMDPC). However, the relationship between Mn metabolism and HMDPC is poorly understood, and no specific treatments are available for this disorder. Here, we generated two zebrafish slc30a10 mutant lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Compared to wild-type animals, mutant adult animals developed significantly higher systemic Mn levels, and Mn accumulated in the brain and liver of mutant embryos in response to exogenous Mn. Interestingly, slc30a10 mutants developed neurological deficits in adulthood, as well as environmental Mn-induced manganism in the embryonic stage; moreover, mutant animals had impaired dopaminergic and GABAergic signaling. Finally, mutant animals developed steatosis, liver fibrosis, and polycythemia accompanied by increased epo expression. This phenotype was rescued partially by EDTA- CaNa2 chelation therapy and iron supplementation. Interestingly, prior to the onset of slc30a10 expression, expressing ATP2C1 (ATPase secretory pathway Ca2+ transporting 1) protected mutant embryos from Mn exposure, suggesting a compensatory role for Atp2c1 in the absence of Slc30a10. Notably, expressing either wild-type or mutant forms of SLC30A10 was sufficient to inhibit the effect of ATP2C1 in response to Mn challenge in both zebrafish embryos and HeLa cells. These findings suggest that either activating ATP2C1 or restoring the Mn-induced trafficking of ATP2C1 can reduce Mn accumulation, providing a possible target for treating HMDPC.",Xia Z; Wei J; Li Y; Wang J; Li W; Wang K; Hong X; Zhao L; Chen C; Min J; Wang F,PLoS genetics,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28692648/,0,0,0,0,0,0
28689206,"Guide for Current Nutrigenetic, Nutrigenomic, and Nutriepigenetic Approaches for Precision Nutrition Involving the Prevention and Management of Chronic Diseases Associated with Obesity.","Chronic diseases, including obesity, are major causes of morbidity and mortality in most countries. The adverse impacts of obesity and associated comorbidities on health remain a major concern due to the lack of effective interventions for prevention and management. Precision nutrition is an emerging therapeutic approach that takes into account an individual's genetic and epigenetic information, as well as age, gender, or particular physiopathological status. Advances in genomic sciences are contributing to a better understanding of the role of genetic variants and epigenetic signatures as well as gene expression patterns in the development of diverse chronic conditions, and how they may modify therapeutic responses. This knowledge has led to the search for genetic and epigenetic biomarkers to predict the risk of developing chronic diseases and personalizing their prevention and treatment. Additionally, original nutritional interventions based on nutrients and bioactive dietary compounds that can modify epigenetic marks and gene expression have been implemented. Although caution must be exercised, these scientific insights are paving the way for the design of innovative strategies for the control of chronic diseases accompanying obesity. This document provides a number of examples of the huge potential of understanding nutrigenetic, nutrigenomic, and nutriepigenetic roles in precision nutrition.",Ramos-Lopez O; Milagro FI; Allayee H; Chmurzynska A; Choi MS; Curi R; De Caterina R; Ferguson LR; Goni L; Kang JX; Kohlmeier M; Marti A; Moreno LA; Pérusse L; Prasad C; Qi L; Reifen R; Riezu-Boj JI; San-Cristobal R; Santos JL; Martínez JA,Journal of nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28689206/,0,0,0,0,0,0
28684688,Gene-Dairy Food Interactions and Health Outcomes: A Review of Nutrigenetic Studies.,"Each person differs from the next by an average of over 3 million genetic variations in their DNA. This genetic diversity is responsible for many of the interindividual differences in food preferences, nutritional needs, and dietary responses between humans. The field of nutrigenetics aims to utilize this type of genetic information in order to personalize diets for optimal health. One of the most well-studied genetic variants affecting human dietary patterns and health is the lactase persistence mutation, which enables an individual to digest milk sugar into adulthood. Lactase persistence is one of the most influential Mendelian factors affecting human dietary patterns to occur since the beginning of the Neolithic Revolution. However, the lactase persistence mutation is only one of many mutations that can influence the relationship between dairy intake and disease risk. The purpose of this review is to summarize the available nutrigenetic literature investigating the relationships between genetics, dairy intake, and health outcomes. Nonetheless, the understanding of an individual's nutrigenetic responses is just one component of personalized nutrition. In addition to nutrigenetic responses, future studies should also take into account nutrigenomic responses (epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic), and phenotypic/characteristic traits (age, gender, activity level, disease status, etc.), as these factors all interact with diet to influence health.",Comerford KB; Pasin G,Nutrients,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28684688/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28387720,Gene-Diet Interaction and Precision Nutrition in Obesity.,"The rapid rise of obesity during the past decades has coincided with a profound shift of our living environment, including unhealthy dietary patterns, a sedentary lifestyle, and physical inactivity. Genetic predisposition to obesity may have interacted with such an obesogenic environment in determining the obesity epidemic. Growing studies have found that changes in adiposity and metabolic response to low-calorie weight loss diets might be modified by genetic variants related to obesity, metabolic status and preference to nutrients. This review summarized data from recent studies of gene-diet interactions, and discussed integration of research of metabolomics and gut microbiome, as well as potential application of the findings in precision nutrition.",Heianza Y; Qi L,International journal of molecular sciences,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28387720/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28337931,Utilizing nutritional genomics to tailor diets for the prevention of cardiovascular disease: a guide for upcoming studies and implementations.,"Personalized diets based on an individual's genome to optimize the success of dietary intervention and reduce genetic cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, is one of the challenges most frequently discussed in the scientific community. Areas covered: The authors gathered literature-based evidence on nutritional genomics and CVD phenotypes, our own results and research experience to provide a critical overview of the current situation of using nutritional genomics to tailor diets for CVD prevention and to propose guidelines for future studies and implementations. Expert commentary: Hundreds of studies on gene-diet interactions determining CVD intermediate (plasma lipids, hypertension, etc.) and final phenotypes (stroke, etc.) have furnished top-level scientific evidence for claiming that the genetic effect in cardiovascular risk is not deterministic, but can be modified by diet. However, despite the many results obtained, there are still gaps in practically applying a personalized diet design to specific genotypes. Hence, a better systemization and methodological improvement of new studies is required to obtain top-level evidence that will allow their application in the future precision nutrition/medicine. The authors propose several recommendations for tackling new approaches and applications.",Corella D; Coltell O; Mattingley G; Sorlí JV; Ordovas JM,Expert review of molecular diagnostics,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28337931/,1,0,0,0,0,0

28066828,THE BENEFITS OF CUSTOMIZED DNA DIRECTED NUTRITION TO BALANCE THE BRAIN REWARD CIRCUITRY AND REDUCE ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS.,"DNA Customization of nutraceutical products is here. In the truest sense, ""Gene Guided Precision Nutrition<sup>™</sup>"" and KB220 variants (a complex mixture of amino-acids, trace metals, and herbals) are the pioneers and standard-bearers for a state of the art DNA customization. Findings by both, Kenneth Blum, Ph.D. and Ernest Noble, Ph.D. concerning the role of genes in shaping cravings and pleasure- seeking, opened the doors to comprehension of how genetics control our actions and effect our mental and physical health. Moreover, technology that is related to KB220 variants in order to reduce or eradicate excessive cravings by influencing gene expression is a cornerstone in the pioneering of the practical applications of nutrigenomics. Continuing discoveries have been an important catalyst for the evolution, expansion, and scientific recognition of the significance of nutrigenomics and its remarkable contributions to human health. Neuro-Nutrigenomics is now a very important field of scientific investigation that offers great promise to improving the human condition. In the forefront is the development of the Genetic Addiction Risk Score (GARS<sup>™</sup>), which unlike 23andMe, has predictive value for the severity of drug and alcohol abuse as well as other non-substance related addictive behaviors. While customization of neuronutrients has not yet been commercialized, there is emerging evidence that in the future, the concept will be developed and could have a significant impact in addiction medicine.",Blum K; Downs BW; Dushaj K; Li M; Braverman ER; Fried L; Waite R; Demotrovics Z; Badgaiyan RD,Precision medicine,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28066828/,0,0,0,0,0,0
28065180,Phenotypic factors influencing the variation in response of circulating cholesterol level to personalised dietary advice in the Food4Me study.,"Individual response to dietary interventions can be highly variable. The phenotypic characteristics of those who will respond positively to personalised dietary advice are largely unknown. The objective of this study was to compare the phenotypic profiles of differential responders to personalised dietary intervention, with a focus on total circulating cholesterol. Subjects from the Food4Me multi-centre study were classified as responders or non-responders to dietary advice on the basis of the change in cholesterol level from baseline to month 6, with lower and upper quartiles defined as responder and non-responder groups, respectively. There were no significant differences between demographic and anthropometric profiles of the groups. Furthermore, with the exception of alcohol, there was no significant difference in reported dietary intake, at baseline. However, there were marked differences in baseline fatty acid profiles. The responder group had significantly higher levels of stearic acid (18 : 0, P=0·034) and lower levels of palmitic acid (16 : 0, P=0·009). Total MUFA (P=0·016) and total PUFA (P=0·008) also differed between the groups. In a step-wise logistic regression model, age, baseline total cholesterol, glucose, five fatty acids and alcohol intakes were selected as factors that successfully discriminated responders from non-responders, with sensitivity of 82 % and specificity of 83 %. The successful delivery of personalised dietary advice may depend on our ability to identify phenotypes that are responsive. The results demonstrate the potential use of metabolic profiles in identifying response to an intervention and could play an important role in the development of precision nutrition.",Kirwan L; Walsh MC; Celis-Morales C; Marsaux CF; Livingstone KM; Navas-Carretero S; Fallaize R; O'Donovan CB; Woolhead C; Forster H; Kolossa S; Daniel H; Moschonis G; Manios Y; Surwillo A; Godlewska M; Traczyk I; Drevon CA; Gibney MJ; Lovegrove JA; Martinez JA; Saris WH; Mathers JC; Gibney ER; Brennan L,The British journal of nutrition,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28065180/,0,0,0,0,1,0
28057105,[Precision nutrition in the era of precision medicine].,"Precision medicine has been increasingly incorporated into clinical practice and is enabling a new era for disease prevention and treatment. As an important constituent of precision medicine, precision nutrition has also been drawing more attention during physical examinations. The main aim of precision nutrition is to provide safe and efficient intervention methods for disease treatment and management, through fully considering the genetics, lifestyle (dietary, exercise and lifestyle choices), metabolic status, gut microbiota and physiological status (nutrient level and disease status) of individuals. Three major components should be considered in precision nutrition, including individual criteria for sufficient nutritional status, biomarker monitoring or techniques for nutrient detection and the applicable therapeutic or intervention methods. It was suggested that, in clinical practice, many inherited and chronic metabolic diseases might be prevented or managed through precision nutritional intervention. For generally healthy populations, because lifestyles, dietary factors, genetic factors and environmental exposures vary among individuals, precision nutrition is warranted to improve their physical activity and reduce disease risks. In summary, research and practice is leading toward precision nutrition becoming an integral constituent of clinical nutrition and disease prevention in the era of precision medicine.",Chen PZ; Wang H,Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28057105/,0,0,0,0,0,0
