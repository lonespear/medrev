41515177,Thyroid-Microbiome Allostasis and Mitochondrial Performance: An Integrative Perspective in Exercise Physiology.,"Exercise acts as a physiological stimulus, requiring precise coordination among endocrine, microbial, and mitochondrial systems to maintain metabolic stability through allostatic regulation. The goal of the article is to integrate multidisciplinary evidence to characterize the thyroid-microbiome-mitochondrial axis as a key regulator of the allostatic state in athletic physiological response. During acute, chronic, and overload training phases, the thyroid-microbiome-mitochondrial axis operates bidirectionally, coupling microbial signaling with endocrine and mitochondrial networks to mediate metabolic response to exercise. This response shows interindividual variability driven by sex, age, genetics, and nutritional status, shaping the boundaries between adaptive efficiency and allostatic overload. Microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and secondary bile acids, modulate deiodinase activity, bile acid recycling, and mitochondrial biogenesis through AMPK-SIRT1-PGC1α signaling, optimizing substrate use and thermogenic capacity. Thyroid hormones reciprocally regulate gut motility, luminal pH, and bile secretion, maintaining microbial diversity and mineral absorption. Under excessive training load, caloric restriction, or inadequate recovery, this network becomes transiently unbalanced: SCFA synthesis decreases, D3 activity increases, and a reversible low-T<sub>3</sub>/high-rT<sub>3</sub> pattern emerges, resembling early Hashimoto- or Graves-like responses. Selenium-, zinc-, and iron-dependent enzymes form the redox link between microbial metabolism, thyroid control, and mitochondrial defense. In conclusion, the thyroid-microbiome-mitochondrial axis provides the physiological basis for the allostatic state, a reversible phase of dynamic recalibration that integrates training, nutrition, environmental stress, and circadian cues to sustain thyroid activity, mitochondrial efficiency, and microbial balance. This integrative perspective supports precision interventions to optimize recovery and performance in athletes.",Odriozola A; González A; Odriozola I; Corbi F; Álvarez-Herms J,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41515177/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41496202,"Resistance-based training improves mitochondrial capacity and redox balance in aging adults, independent of polyphenol supplementation.","Aging is associated with declines in skeletal muscle function, mitochondrial capacity, and changes in redox balance, which collectively contribute to frailty and chronic disease risk. This study investigated the effects of a 12-week resistance training (RT) program combined with a small dose of high-intensity interval training (HIIT), with or without polyphenol supplementation, on mitochondrial respiratory capacity (MRC) and oxidative stress in middle-aged and older adults (55-70 years). Forty-one participants were randomized to receive either a polyphenol supplement or a placebo for 30 days before the training intervention. Following the training intervention, aerobic capacity, lean mass, and strength improved significantly in both groups. Training also increased MRC in the placebo group but not in the polyphenol group, which displayed higher MRC following the supplementation phase, possibly reflecting either a supplement effect or baseline variation. The training resulted in a 20 % decrease in skeletal muscle H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> emission across both groups, suggesting enhanced mitochondrial efficiency or antioxidant defenses. However, gene expression of selected antioxidants was unchanged, and plasma oxidative stress markers malondialdehyde (MDA) increased, and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) remained unchanged. Circulating antioxidants showed distinct changes with training, as ascorbic acid increased with training in both groups, while α-tocopherol increased only in the placebo group and β-cryptoxanthin and retinol declined in the polyphenol group, suggesting potential supplement-nutrient interactions. Uric acid increased in both groups, likely reflecting exercise-induced purine turnover. In conclusion, combined RT and HIIT improved mitochondrial bioenergetics and muscle redox balance in middle-aged and older adults, whereas polyphenol supplementation did not augment these adaptations and may have blunted some vitamin-related responses. These findings underscore resistance-based exercise as a potent intervention for maintaining physical and mitochondrial health with age.",Flensted-Jensen M; Weinreich CM; Kleis-Olsen AS; Hansen F; Skyggelund NS; Pii JR; Whitlock R; Karlsen A; Ingersen A; Reihmane D; Weber D; Grune T; Pivovarova-Ramich O; Dela F,Redox biology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41496202/,0,0,0,0,1,0

Diet is a key factor and emerging evidence highlights substantial inter-individual variability in metabolic responses to diets, highlighting the need for precision nutrition. The China Precision Nutrition Biobank (CPNB) is a prospective, longitudinal, cohort study designed to investigate diet-phenotype/genotype interactions and develop precision dietary strategies for early prevention and intervention of chronic diseases, with a particular focus on early-onset diseases. CPNB consists of three phases: the alpha (pilot cohort), beta (transition cohort), and gamma (main cohort) phases. Approximately 200, 1450, and 20,000 adults aged 18-40 years from urban and rural areas in China including Beijing, one city each in Heilongjiang, Shandong, Zhejiang, Guangxi, and Hainan provinces, and one or more villages each in Henan, Gansu, Sichuan, Zhejiang, and Hunan provinces will be recruited during the alpha, beta, and gamma phases, respectively, between 2025 and 2035. Sociodemographic information, medical records, read-time weighed food records and corresponding continuous glucose monitor (CGM) readings, objective physical activity, food challenges, genes, gut and oral microbiota, metabolites from blood, stool, urine, saliva, and hair, and questionnaires will be collected at baseline survey. The follow-up survey will be conducted every five years to repeat these assessments until participants' death (the follow-up period may extend up to 80 years). Outcomes of interest are common early- and late-onset chronic diseases and their preclinical stages. The CPNB data can be used to develop prediction models for personalized metabolic responses and risks of early-onset chronic diseases among Chinese people. It will also provide new evidence on interactions of diet with human phenotypes/genotypes during preclinical stage, onset, and progression of early-onset diseases.

Here, utilizing a chemically defined diet (CDD) in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, we systematically evaluated a multimodal intervention combining methionine restriction (MR), taurine supplementation (Tau), and moderate exercise. This combinatorial approach synergistically extended lifespan, preserved reproductive capacity, and improved locomotor function. Integrative targeted metabolomics and stable isotope tracing revealed increased mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux and enhanced redox homeostasis in the gut as central metabolic features. Notably, <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> was identified as a key microbial mediator responsive to dietary and behavioral stimuli, potentially coordinating host energy metabolism and maintaining physiological integrity.

41374076,"The Gut-Muscle-Immune Axis in Motion: Mechanistic Synergies of SCFA Metabolism, Exercise, and Microbial Cross-Feeding.","The gut microbiota plays a fundamental role in metabolic and immune homeostasis through the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). These metabolites influence mitochondrial biogenesis, muscle energetics, epithelial barrier stability, and inflammatory regulation via G-protein-coupled receptors, AMPK-PGC-1α signaling, and epigenetic remodeling. This review synthesizes current evidence on the gut-muscle-immune axis, emphasizing how dietary fermentable substrates, microbial cross-feeding interactions, and structured exercise modulate SCFA production and shape host physiological adaptation. We integrated findings from human and animal studies, multi-omic analyses, metabolomic and microbiome research, and exercise physiology to outline mechanistic links between microbial metabolism and systemic resilience. Key mechanistic pathways connecting dietary fiber fermentation to mitochondrial function, redox regulation, immune homeostasis, and metabolic plasticity are summarized. We further present the Targeted Gut Protocol 2.0, a conceptual 12-week framework combining fiber-diversity targets, lactate-guided exercise periodization, biomarker monitoring, and adaptive feedback mechanisms to enhance endogenous SCFA availability. SCFA-driven metabolic plasticity provides an integrative model through which lifestyle behaviors can modulate host physiology.

41373948,Personalized Nutritional Assessment and Intervention for Athletes: A Network Physiology Approach.,"Nutritional assessment and intervention in athletes, a central focus of sports medicine and healthcare, has increasingly shifted in recent years toward precision nutrition-an approach that individualizes dietary recommendations according to genetic profile, microbiome composition, lifestyle factors, and health status. Despite its promising potential, this approach faces significant limitations, including the challenge of integrating complex and dynamic interactions among multilevel indicators, and the relatively high costs associated with omics technologies. The aim of this paper is to propose a nutritional assessment and intervention model grounded in the Network Physiology of Exercise, an emerging scientific field that investigates the horizontal and vertical dynamic interactions among nested physiological levels and conceptualizes athletes as complex adaptive systems (CAS). The proposal integrates social, environmental, behavioral and psychobiological information, extracted particularly from semi-structured interviews based on CAS properties. Accordingly, the traditional dietary assessment tools are replaced by open and guided interviews that allow professionals and practitioners to co-construct meaningful insights and extract qualitative data through a reflexive thematic analysis. From a CAS perspective, the multidimensional and multi-timescale personal and environmental constrains affecting their eating behavior were integrated through a hierarchically nested organization. Eliciting the dynamics of emotional contexts, behavioral patterns, and psychophysiological states, the interviews become both a method of assessment and an intervention in itself.",Prieto A; Lizarraga MA; Balagué N,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41373948/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41314750,Personalized management of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dopaminergic neuron loss, α-synuclein aggregation, and oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. These contribute to motor symptoms like bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and postural instability, alongside non-motor issues such as cognitive decline and autonomic dysfunction. With rising global prevalence, especially in aging populations, understanding PD's complex pathophysiology is essential for advancing effective therapeutic strategies. This chapter offers a comprehensive overview of Parkinson's disease, covering its demographic trends, molecular mechanisms, symptoms, and current pharmacological treatments, including their mechanisms, classifications, benefits, and side effects. The central focus is on the emerging shift from standard symptomatic care to personalized, precision-based treatment strategies. These include gene-targeted therapies like RNA interference and CRISPR-Cas9, mitochondrial-based approaches, and stem cell innovations such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Pharmacogenetic profiling and biomarker-based interventions further support individualized therapeutic plans by predicting drug responses and tracking disease progression. This chapter explores patient-centric models like personalized neurorehabilitation, DBS, and cognitive-behavioral therapy, alongside advanced technologies such as AI, VR, AR, and wearable devices that enhance treatment, symptom monitoring, and real-time feedback through mobile applications. Lifestyle adaptations, including precision nutrition and customized exercise regimens, are highlighted as key components of comprehensive care.

41186329,Evaluating untargeted metabolomics pipelines for sports nutrition research: a review.,"Untargeted metabolomics has emerged as a transformative approach in sports nutrition research, offering an unbiased means to characterize the complex biochemical responses to exercise, training, and dietary interventions. Unlike targeted assays restricted to predefined metabolites, untargeted strategies capture broad metabolic perturbations across lipid, carbohydrate, amino acid, and nucleotide pathways, enabling the discovery of novel biomarkers and unanticipated physiological mechanisms. This review critically evaluates the design and application of untargeted metabolomic pipelines in the context of exercise and nutrition science, from pre-analytical sample handling and analytical platforms such as NMR, LC-MS, and GC-MS, to data processing using tools like XCMS, MZmine, and MS-DIAL, and subsequent statistical and bioinformatic interpretation. Key applications include delineating acute metabolic shocks induced by endurance exercise, identifying athlete-specific metabolic phenotypes shaped by chronic training, and assessing the impact of nutritional interventions such as fruit intake, amino acid supplementation, or polyphenol-rich foods on exercise recovery and oxidative stress. The integration of metabolomics with other omics, particularly microbiome metagenomics and lipidomics, highlights the potential for systems-level insights into host-microbe-diet interactions. Nonetheless, significant challenges remain, including the reproducibility of findings, difficulties in metabolite identification, and the translational gap between large datasets and actionable nutritional strategies. By synthesizing current strengths, limitations, and controversies, this review emphasizes that the future of sports metabolomics lies in methodological standardization, multi-omics integration, and validation of candidate biomarkers in independent cohorts. Collectively, these efforts position untargeted metabolomics as a cornerstone for advancing precision nutrition and personalized performance monitoring in athletes.",Liu Y; Liu X; Hu Y; Gao F; Yu W; Cheng F,Analytical methods : advancing methods and applications,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41186329/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41176812,From prediction of personalized metabolic responses to foods to computational nutrition: Concepts of an emerging interdisciplinary field.,"Recent advances in artificial intelligence, wearable biosensors, and multi-omics technologies, combined with interdisciplinary translational collaborations, are transforming the landscape of nutrition, particularly by enabling precision nutrition. We propose computational nutrition as an emerging interdisciplinary field that aims to address complex challenges in nutrition and health and drive paradigm shifts in nutrition research through computational methods in statistics and computer science (e.g., statistical modeling, simulation, causal inference, machine learning, and deep learning) and multi-modal data. Computational nutrition employs epidemiology and data science as its methodologies and integrates expertise from nutrition, food science, computer science, statistics, systems biology, and public health. The main research directions of computational nutrition are: 1) prediction of personalized metabolic responses to foods and establishment of individualized dietary reference intakes; 2) causal inference in nutrition and diseases and evaluation of individualized treatment effects of nutritional interventions; 3) precise and dynamic assessment and monitoring of diet-related disease risks; 4) simulation and evaluation of public health nutrition policies and sustainability assessment of dietary patterns.

41096907,"Dietary and Pharmacological Modulation of Aging-Related Metabolic Pathways: Molecular Insights, Clinical Evidence, and a Translational Model.","Advances in geroscience suggest that aging is modulated by molecular pathways that are amenable to dietary and pharmacological intervention. We conducted an integrative critical review of caloric restriction (CR), intermittent fasting (IF), and caloric restriction mimetics (CR-mimetics) to compare shared mechanisms, clinical evidence, limitations, and translational potential. Across modalities, CR and IF consistently activate AMP-activated protein kinase and sirtuins, inhibit mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) signaling, and enhance autophagy, aligning with improvements in insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, low-grade inflammation, and selected epigenetic aging measures in humans. CR-mimetics, such as metformin, resveratrol, rapamycin, and spermidine, partially reproduce these effects; however, long-term safety and efficacy in healthy populations remain incompletely defined. Methodological constraints-short trial duration, selective samples, intermediate (nonclinical) endpoints, and limited adherence monitoring-impede definitive conclusions on hard outcomes (frailty, disability, hospitalization, mortality). We propose the Active Management of Aging and Longevity (AMAL) model, a three-level biomarker-guided framework that integrates personalized diet, chrono-nutrition, exercise, and the selective use of CR-mimetics, along with digital monitoring and decision support. AMAL emphasizes epigenetic clocks, multi-omics profiling, inflammatory and microbiome metrics, and adaptive protocols to enhance adherence and clinical relevance. Overall, CR, IF, and CR mimetics constitute promising, complementary strategies to modulate biological aging; rigorous long-term trials with standardized biomarkers and clinically meaningful endpoints are needed to enable their scalable implementation.",Murillo-Cancho AF; Lozano-Paniagua D; Nievas-Soriano BJ,International journal of molecular sciences,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41096907/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41094026,Long-term effects of dietary protein and carbohydrate quality on prediabetes remission: results from the PREVIEW randomised multinational diabetes prevention trial.,"Recent studies advocate prediabetes remission as a goal in diabetes prevention, but the optimal dietary composition for prediabetes remission over the long term is unknown. We aimed to examine the long-term effects on prediabetes remission of a prudent diet with moderate protein and a moderate glycaemic index (GI) (akin to general dietary guidelines) vs a high-protein, low-GI diet. This study is a secondary analysis of PREVIEW, which is a 3 year, multicentre, parallel, randomised trial. Adults with overweight/obesity (BMI ≥ 25 and <30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or BMI ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively) and prediabetes (fasting glucose 5.6-6.9 mmol/l and/or 2 h glucose 7.8-11.0 mmol/l determined using an OGTT) were recruited. Eligible participants underwent an 8-week rapid weight loss programme comprising a low-energy diet, followed by a 3 year weight maintenance phase comprising lifestyle intervention. At baseline, participants were randomly assigned to a high-protein (25% of energy from protein), low-GI (GI<50) diet, or a prudent diet with moderate protein (15% of energy from protein) and moderate GI (GI>56). The primary outcome of the current analysis was the number of participants who achieved prediabetes remission (i.e. a return to normal fasting glucose and normal glucose tolerance) at 1 year or 3 years. Secondary outcomes were changes in body weight and composition over 3 years (continuous variables) and maintenance of a ≥8% weight loss target (binary variable). Modified intention-to-treat analyses were performed on all participants who received the dietary intervention (n=1856). Risk ratios and 95% CI for prediabetes remission and maintaining the weight loss target in each diet group were estimated using multilevel modified Poisson regression adjusted for age and sex. Linear mixed models were used to estimate the dietary effects on changes in body weight and composition. The moderate-protein, moderate-GI group (n=923) had a higher rate of remission than the high-protein, low-GI group (n=933) at both 1 year (rate of remission 26.3% vs 20.7%; RR 1.26; 95% CI 1.04, 1.53; p=0.025) and 3 years (20.6% vs 15.5%; RR 1.26; 95% CI 1.06, 1.50; p=0.015). However, body weight and composition changes were similar for participants on the moderate-protein, moderate-GI vs high-protein, low-GI diet at 1 year (54.0% vs 57.3% of participants met the weight loss maintenance target [≥8% of initial body weight]; p=0.215) and 3 years (31.4% vs 30.4%, respectively; p=0.793). The differences in remission rates of the two dietary patterns were independent of body weight and composition changes. Following rapid weight loss, a prudent diet with moderate protein and moderate GI was more effective for long-term prediabetes remission than a high-protein, low-GI diet, irrespective of weight change.

40953839,Gut Microbiota-Targeted Polyphenol Interventions: A Novel Paradigm and Synergistic Strategies for Obesity Management.,"Obesity has emerged as a major metabolic disorder threatening global public health, with gut microbiota (GM) dysbiosis recognized as a key pathogenic driver. While existing reviews have explored associations between GM and obesity (e.g., the gut-liver axis), this review focuses specifically on polyphenols to establish a novel paradigm of ""GM-targeted polyphenol interventions."" Naturally occurring polyphenols exhibit unique advantages in obesity management; however, their systemic effects critically depend on GM-mediated biotransformation. Herein, we propose the ""Polyphenol-GM Axis"" as the core mechanism underpinning polyphenol efficacy against obesity, synthesizing and integrating current evidence. This comprehensive review elucidates how polyphenols from diverse sources ameliorate obesity through GM modulation: (1) remodeling gut-liver crosstalk via bile acid metabolism; (2) inhibiting lipogenesis through GM-derived metabolites; (3) restoring intestinal barrier integrity; (4) blocking inflammatory cascades. We elucidate causal relationships between polyphenol-induced GM shifts and host metabolic outcomes, revealing targeted pathways for bidirectional ""microbiota-host"" regulation. Critically, we propose that combining GM-targeted polyphenol interventions with lifestyle modifications (diet/exercise) enables precision nutrition. This paradigm provides a theoretical foundation for developing polyphenol-based therapeutics beyond nutritional supplements. Future research should prioritize personalized GM modulation and structural optimization of polyphenols to accelerate their translation from functional foods to clinical agents for obesity management.",Cai Y; Xu J; Wang B,Phytotherapy research : PTR,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40953839/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40946974,Selenium and brain aging: A comprehensive review with a focus on hippocampal neurogenesis.,"Brain aging is accompanied by progressive cognitive decline and increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases, with adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) playing a pivotal role in maintaining cognitive resilience. Selenium, an essential trace element, exerts significant neuroprotective and neurogenic effects predominantly through its incorporation into selenoproteins, which regulate oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and synaptic plasticity. This review synthesizes recent advances delineating selenium's metabolism, bioavailability, and its multifaceted roles in brain development, function, and aging, emphasizing mechanisms underpinning hippocampal neurogenesis. Key molecular pathways influenced by selenium include phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/Wingless/Integrated (Wnt) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) signaling pathways that promote neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. Selenium transport via selenoprotein P and its receptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 8 (LRP8) is critical for adequate selenium delivery to the hippocampus to support neurogenesis, with exercise demonstrated to potentiate this axis. Selenium also mitigates ferroptosis, preserves mitochondrial integrity, and modulates neuroimmune interactions by attenuating microglial activation and inflammasome signaling, fostering a neurogenic environment. Emerging evidence highlights selenium's regulatory effects on RNA expression, including microRNAs modifications, further influencing neuronal health. Despite promising preclinical and observational data, clinical translation remains limited by heterogeneous and short-term studies. Future research priorities include multi-omics investigations, longitudinal cohorts, and addressing global selenium intake disparities through policy initiatives and precision nutrition. By consolidating mechanistic insights with clinical perspectives, this review underscores selenium's potential as a modifiable factor to enhance AHN and cognitive health, advocating for integrated translational strategies to combat brain aging and neurodegeneration.",Daneshpour A; Leite MEN; Wagner KH; Sabico S; Al-Daghri NM; Aldisi D; König D; Gil JFL; Stubbs B,Ageing research reviews,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40946974/,1,0,0,0,0,1
40854218,Comparison of an Energy-Reduced Mediterranean Diet and Physical Activity Versus an Ad Libitum Mediterranean Diet in the Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes : A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Limited research has been done to evaluate the combined effect of energy reduction, Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), and physical activity on type 2 diabetes incidence. To evaluate whether an energy-reduced MedDiet (erMedDiet) plus physical activity reduces diabetes incidence compared with a standard MedDiet. Prespecified secondary outcome analysis in the PREDIMED (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea)-Plus randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial. (ISRCTN Registry: ISRCTN89898870). 23 centers across Spain. 4746 adults aged 55 to 75 years with metabolic syndrome and overweight or obesity, without prior cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to an intervention group receiving an erMedDiet (planned reduction of 600 kcal per day), increased physical activity, and behavioral strategies for reducing weight, or a control group receiving ad libitum MedDiet advice. Diabetes incidence was based on the American Diabetes Association criteria. Anthropometric measurements were obtained annually. Cox regression models were used to assess the intervention effect. The 6-year absolute risk was 12.0% (95% CI, 11.9% to 12.1%) in the control group (349 cases) and 9.5% (CI, 9.4% to 9.5%) in the intervention group (280 cases). Over a median 6-year follow-up, diabetes incidence was 31% (CI, 18% to 41%) relatively lower in the intervention group compared with the control group, with an absolute risk reduction of -2.6 cases (CI, -2.7 to -2.4) per 1000 person-years.

40806058,Histamine Metabolism in IBD: Towards Precision Nutrition.,"Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) exhibit a dysregulated immune response that may be further exacerbated by bioactive compounds, such as histamine. Current dietary guidelines for IBD primarily focus on symptom management and flare-up prevention, yet targeted nutritional strategies addressing histamine metabolism remain largely unexplored. This narrative review aims to summarize the existing literature on the complex interplay between IBD and histamine metabolism and propose a novel dietary framework for managing IBD progression in patients with histamine intolerance (HIT). Relevant studies were identified through a comprehensive literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science. The proposed low-histamine diet (LHD) aims to reduce the overall histamine burden in the body through two primary strategies: (1) minimizing exogenous intake by limiting high-histamine and histamine-releasing foods and (2) reducing endogenous histamine production by modulating gut microbiota composition, specifically targeting histamine-producing bacteria. In parallel, identifying individuals who are histamine-intolerant and understanding the role of histamine-degrading enzymes, such as diamine oxidase (DAO) and histamine-N-methyltransferase (HNMT), are emerging as important areas of focus. Despite growing interest in the role of histamine and mast cell activation in gut inflammation, no clinical trials have investigated the effects of a low-histamine diet in IBD populations. Therefore, future research should prioritize the implementation of LHD interventions in IBD patients to evaluate their generalizability and clinical applicability.",Kanta D; Katsamakas E; Gudiksen AMB; Jalili M,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40806058/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40777169,The relationship between carotenoids and diabetic nephropathy: insights from NHANES.,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) poses significant health risks and imposes a substantial global disease burden. The association between carotenoid intake and DN remains unclear. Utilizing data from the 2007-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), this study investigates the relationship between multiple carotenoid subtypes and DN, aiming to inform exploratory insights for potential preventive strategies. This cross-sectional analysis utilized NHANES 2007-2018 data with a multistage stratified sampling design. After a four-stage screening process, baseline participants were selected by excluding individuals with lacking diabetes-related data, pregnant women, and those with incomplete carotenoid intake or DN diagnostic records. Model 1 included 25,483 participants, while Model 2 comprised retained 13,271 participants after further adjustment for covariates (demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, clinical indicators, and socioeconomic parameters). Dietary intake of six carotenoid subtypes (<i>α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, Lycopene, Lutein, Zeaxanthin</i>) was calculated using as the mean of two standardized 24-h dietary recalls. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was diagnosed based on fasting plasma glucose (≥126 mg/dL), HbA1c (≥6.5%), hypoglycemic medication use, or clinical diagnosis. DN was defined as a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥ 30 mg/g or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> in T2DM patients. Statistical analyses employed weighted multivariable logistic regression using the R survey package, adjusting for sampling design and covariates. Associations were quantified as odds ratios (ORs per 10 μg/d carotenoid intake) with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons. The significance threshold was set at <i>α</i> = 0.05. This NHANES-based study revealed nonlinear associations between dietary carotenoids and diabetic nephropathy (DN) risk, with notable gender-and ethnicity-specific gender/ethnicity-specific effects. Univariate analysis demonstrated elevated DN risk with higher β-cryptoxanthin intake (OR = 1.413, 95% CI), though significance was attenuated dissipated after multivariable adjustment, suggesting confounding mediation by obesity and hypertension. Multivariable models identified threshold effects: the low <i>α</i>-carotene intake group exhibited a 75% reduced risk (OR = 0.25, 95% CI), while the high-intake group showed a paradoxical risk elevation (OR = 2.24, 95% CI). β-Carotene displayed gender-divergent effects, with the highest tertile significantly reducing risk in males by 43% (OR = 0.57, 95% CI). Interaction models highlighted intensified <i>α</i>-carotene protection in males and Non-Hispanic White (OR = 0.27-0.29), whereas lycopene correlated with a fivefold increased DN risk in Non-Hispanic Black (OR = 4.99, 95% CI). Cardinal risk factors included advanced age (OR = 1.06/year), obesity (OR = 1.07/BMI unit), male sex (OR = 3.05), and hypertension (OR = 4.7), while higher education (OR = 0.72) and moderate alcohol consumption exerted inversely associated effects. These findings underscore the necessity of integrating nutrient thresholds (e.g., <i>α</i>-carotene optimization) and social determinants into DN prevention, though racial subgroup analyses warrant validation through prospective cohorts due to sample size constraints. Clinicians managing DN should: Prioritize Consider <i>α</i>-carotene's biphasic dose-response relationship, prioritizing intake within the optimal dosage window; Utilize Leverage β-carotene's gender-specific benefits for male patients; Exercise caution in consider exploringing lycopene-rich dietary interventions diets for African American populations. Public health initiatives should incorporate nutrient-gender-ethnicity triadic assessments into DN education programs to advance precision nutrition guidelines.",Wang L; Feng T; Tan Y; Zhang J; Zhang T; Huo J; Song X; Lin X; Li M; Liang W; Ding Q,Frontiers in nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40777169/,0,0,0,0,0,1
40771529,Effect of anti-inflammatory diets on health-related quality of life in adults with chronic disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"To evaluate the effectiveness of anti-inflammatory diets on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in adults with at least one chronic disease. Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science and the Cochrane Centre Register of Controlled Trials from inception to 6 May 2024. Full-text RCTs published in English assessing the effectiveness of any anti-inflammatory dietary intervention (ie, a diet that emphasises the intake of nutrient-rich, minimally processed foods rich in polyphenols, carotenoids and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and limits highly-processed, pro-inflammatory foods) on HRQOL in adults with at least one chronic disease were included. Data extraction, risk-of-bias assessments and strength-of-evidence assessments were done by two independent reviewers. Pooled effects (standardised mean difference (SMD)) for HRQOL (separated into mental and physical component scores wherever possible) were calculated using random effects models with restricted maximum likelihood estimations. Subgroup analyses and meta-regressions were performed to assess the influence of study-level characteristics on HRQOL outcomes. 23 studies reporting HRQOL for 3294 participants were included. The most common chronic diseases were type two diabetes, musculoskeletal conditions and cardiovascular conditions. Anti-inflammatory diets were associated with small improvements in HRQOL physical component scores compared with usual care/other dietary interventions (18 trials, SMD=0.17, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.27) but not in mental component scores (18 trials, SMD=0.09, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.20) or general HRQOL scores (four trials, SMD=0.27, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.77). Pooled effects did not differ by available study-level characteristics; however, diet-only interventions (compared with multi-component interventions) had a greater effect on mental component scores. No study met the Cochrane criteria for low risk of bias. Certainty of evidence was low for physical and mental HRQOL scores and very low for general HRQOL scores. In adults with at least one chronic disease, anti-inflammatory diets lead to small improvements in physical component HRQOL, which may not be clinically relevant. No effect was found on the mental component or general HRQOL. Further high-quality RCTs may change this conclusion.",Law L; Heerey JJ; Devlin BL; Brukner P; De Livera AM; Kemp J; Attanayake A; Skou ST; Bricca A; Culvenor AG,"BMJ nutrition, prevention & health",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40771529/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40732463,Towards Precision Nutrition: A Novel Smartphone-Connected Biosensor for Point-of-Care Detection of β-Hydroxybutyrate in Human Blood and Saliva.,"Precision nutrition is an emerging approach that tailors dietary recommendations based on an individual's unique genetic, metabolic, microbiome, and lifestyle factors. β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB) is a key ketone body produced during fat metabolism, especially in states of fasting, low-carbohydrate intake, or prolonged exercise. Therefore, monitoring β-HB levels provides valuable insights into an individual's metabolic state, making it an essential biomarker for precision and personalized nutrition. A smartphone-connected electrochemical biosensor for single-use, rapid, low-cost, accurate, and selective detection of β-HB in whole blood and saliva at the Point-of-Care (POC) is reported. A graphite screen-printed carbon electrode modified with potassium ferricyanide (Fe(III)GSPE) was used as an electrode platform for the deposition of β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidized form (NAD<sup>+</sup>), and chitosan nanoparticles (ChitNPs). An outer poly(vinyl) chloride (PVC) diffusion-limiting membrane was used to protect the modified electrode. The biosensor showed a linear range in the clinically relevant range, between 0.4 and 8 mM, with a detection limit (LOD) of 0.1 mM. The biosensor was tested on human blood and saliva samples, and the results were compared to those obtained with a commercial ketone meter, showing excellent agreement.",Tortolini C; Caprio M; Gianfrilli D; Lenzi A; Antiochia R,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40732463/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40625617,The human gut microbiota is associated with host lifestyle: a comprehensive narrative review.,"The gut microbiota serves as a critical interface between lifestyle factors and host physiology. Despite extensive research on individual domains including diet, sleep, and exercise, an integrated understanding of their synergistic effects on microbial communities remains incomplete. This knowledge gap limits our ability to develop targeted microbiome-based interventions for metabolic and immune-related disorders. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of peer-reviewed literature from 2000 to present, identified through systematic searches of PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus using key terms related to gut microbiota and lifestyle interventions. Our analysis focused on studies incorporating microbiome profiling techniques, controlled lifestyle interventions, and multi-omics data integration. The review prioritized mechanistic insights from both clinical and preclinical investigations while critically assessing methodological approaches across the field. High-fiber dietary patterns consistently promoted the abundance of beneficial, short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria, though with notable inter-individual variation. Circadian rhythm disruption was associated with reduced microbial diversity and expansion of pro-inflammatory bacterial taxa, paralleling increases in systemic inflammation markers. Athletic populations demonstrated unique microbial signatures characterized by enhanced metabolic potential, with distinct taxonomic profiles emerging across different sport disciplines. This work synthesizes current evidence into a novel framework for understanding lifestyle-microbiota interactions, while identifying key challenges in study design and data interpretation. We propose standardized methodological approaches for future investigations and outline translational strategies for personalized microbiota modulation. These insights advance the potential for targeted microbial interventions to optimize metabolic and immune health outcomes.",Zeng Q; Feng X; Hu Y; Su S,Frontiers in microbiology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40625617/,1,0,0,0,0,0

40438271,Exploration of Pathogenesis and Cutting-Edge Treatment Strategies of Sarcopenia: A Narrative Review.,"Sarcopenia a progressive and multifactorial musculoskeletal syndrome characterized by loss of muscle mass and function, poses a significant global health challenge, particularly in aging populations. Epidemiological studies reveal that sarcopenia affects approximately 5-10% of the general population, with prevalence rates escalating dramatically after age 60 to reach 10-27% in older adults. This age-associated increase contributes significantly to healthcare burdens by elevating risks of disability, frailty, and mortality. Despite its profound impact, current clinical approaches to sarcopenia remain limited. While resistance exercise and protein supplementation form the cornerstone of management, their efficacy is often constrained by poor long-term adherence and variable individual responses, highlighting the urgent need for more comprehensive and personalized treatment strategies. The pathogenesis of sarcopenia is complex and influenced by various factors, including aging, inflammation, nutritional deficits, physical inactivity, and mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying this condition are still not fully understood. Recent research has made significant strides in elucidating the intricate mechanisms contributing to sarcopenia, revealing novel insights into its molecular and cellular underpinnings. Notably, emerging evidence points to the pivotal role of mitochondrial dysfunction, altered myokine profiles, and neuromuscular junction degeneration in sarcopenia progression. Additionally, breakthroughs in stem cell therapy, exosome-based treatments, and precision nutrition offer promising avenues for clinical intervention. This review aims to synthesize the latest advancements in sarcopenia research, focusing on the novel contributions to its pathogenesis and treatment strategies. We explore emerging trends such as the role of cellular senescence, epigenetic regulation, and targeted therapeutic interventions that could reshape future approaches to managing sarcopenia. By highlighting recent breakthroughs and cutting-edge research, we hope to advance the understanding of sarcopenia and foster the translation of these findings into effective clinical therapies.",Gao Y; Liu D; Xiao Q; Huang S; Li L; Xie B; Zhou L; Qi Y; Liu Y,Clinical interventions in aging,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40438271/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Preliminary evidence in Black and White adolescent girls showed that Black girls retain more calcium and excrete more sodium compared to White girls on a high sodium diet. However, little is known about calcium absorption efficiency across other races or age groups. This report outlines the rationale and design of a planned randomized controlled trial aimed at investigating calcium absorption and calcium and sodium excretion in response to diets high (typical Western diet) and low (recommended) in sodium in Black, White, Hispanic, and Asian adults. It is hypothesized that fractional calcium absorption and urinary sodium excretion will vary by subgroup, with Blacks predicted to have the highest rates and Whites the lowest, and intermediate responses in Hispanics and Asians. Participants will undergo two 2-day dietary intervention arms, with biospecimen collection following each arm. Primary outcomes include fractional calcium absorption and urinary calcium excretion, and secondary outcomes comprise urinary sodium excretion and blood pressure.

40284242,Influence of Genetic Polymorphisms and Biochemical Biomarkers on Response to Nutritional Iron Supplementation and Performance in a Professional Football Team: A Pilot Longitudinal Study.,"Iron deficiency is a prevalent issue among elite athletes, particularly in endurance-based sports like football, where optimal iron status is crucial for aerobic capacity and performance. Despite the well-documented role of iron in oxygen transport and energy metabolism, the interplay between genetic polymorphisms, biochemical markers, and iron supplementation remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between genetic polymorphisms and iron status in professional football players, assess the impact of iron supplementation on athletic performance, and develop a predictive model for iron supplementation based on genetic and biochemical profiles. A longitudinal study was conducted over three seasons (2021-2024) with 48 male professional football players. Participants underwent genotyping for polymorphisms in <i>ACE</i> (rs4646994), ACTN3 (rs1815739), <i>AMPD1</i> (rs17602729), <i>CKM</i> (rs8111989), <i>HFE</i> (rs1799945), and <i>MLCK</i> (rs2700352, rs28497577). Biochemical markers (ferritin, haemoglobin, haematocrit, serum iron) and performance metrics (GPS-derived data) were monitored. Iron supplementation (105 mg/day ferrous sulphate) was administered to players with ferritin <30 ng/mL. A Total Genotype Score (TGS) was calculated to evaluate genetic predisposition. Players with ""optimal"" genotypes (<i>ACE</i> DD, <i>ACTN3</i> CC, <i>AMPD1</i> CC, <i>HFE</i> GC) required less iron supplementation (TGS = 51.25 vs. 41.32 a.u.; <i>p</i> = 0.013) and exhibited better performance metrics. Iron supplementation significantly improved haemoglobin and haematocrit in deficient players (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The TGS predicted supplementation need (AUC = 0.711; <i>p</i> = 0.023), with a threshold of 46.42 a.u. (OR = 5.23, 95% CI: 1.336-14.362; <i>p</i> = 0.017 for non-supplemented players). Furthermore, performance data revealed that iron-supplemented players had significantly lower competition time (1128.40 vs. 1972.84 min; <i>p</i> = 0.003), total distance covered (128,129.42 vs. 218,556.64 m; <i>p</i> = 0.005), and high-speed running in the 18-21 km/h (7.58 vs. 10.36 m/min; <i>p</i> = 0.007) and 21-24 km/h (4.43 vs. 6.13 m/min; <i>p</i> = 0.010) speed zones. They also started fewer matches (11.50 vs. 21.59; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Genetic profile combined with biochemical monitoring effectively predicts iron supplementation needs in athletes. Personalized nutrition strategies, guided by TGS, can optimize iron status and enhance performance in elite football players. This approach bridges a critical gap in sports science, offering a framework for precision nutrition in athletics.",Varillas-Delgado D,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40284242/,0,0,0,0,0,1
40259686,Cross-sectional associations between Mediterranean diet and body composition in preschool children. CORAL study.,"Overweight and obesity in children are rising globally, and the Mediterranean diet may help reduce obesity and related diseases. To assess the association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and body composition in Spanish preschool children. This study included 1218 children aged 3-6 years from the CORALS cohort. Mediterranean diet adherence was evaluated using the validated MED4CHILD and COME-Kids F&B-FQ questionnaires. Body composition measurements included weight, height, waist circumference, BMI, Fat Mass (FM), Fat-Free Mass Index (FFMI), and Waist-to-Height ratio (WtHR). Multivariate regression and ANCOVA were used to examine associations, adjusting for factors like age, physical activity, and energy intake. We also performed a Cohen's d analysis to assess effect size. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with more favourable body composition in children. Specifically, both the MED4CHILD score and the COME-Kids-derived score showed significant associations with BMI, FFMI, and Waist-to-Height ratio, showing differences by sex. Children who adhered to the Mediterranean diet exhibited lower BMI and higher fat-free mass, and a more favourable waist-to-height ratio. Additionally, although some measures showed weaker associations, all analyses highlighted a trend towards improved body composition with higher adherence. Cohen's d analysis showed small to moderate effect sizes. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was significantly linked to favorable body composition indices in Spanish children, highlighting the importance of promoting healthy dietary patterns to prevent overweight and obesity.",Larruy-García A; Miguel-Berges ML; Torre IR; Pastor-Villaescusa B; Leis R; Babio N; Navas-Carretero S; Corella D; Pérez A; Gil-Campos M; Picáns-Leis R; Garcia-Gavilán J; Flores-Barrante P; Martínez JA; Llorente-Cantarero FJ; Vázquez-Cobela R; Paz-Graniel I; Ayala-Marín AM; Jurado-Castro JM; de la Torre-Aguilar MJ; Gheorghita I; Moreno LA; De Miguel-Etayo P,Pediatric obesity,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40259686/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40198072,"Mediterranean Diet, Physical Activity, and Bone Health in Older Adults: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial.","Understanding the effects of diet and physical activity on bone health may help to mitigate concomitant weight loss- and age-related bone deterioration. To evaluate the effects of a weight-loss lifestyle intervention on bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC), and low BMD prevalence. The 3-year, parallel-group Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea-Plus (PREDIMED-Plus) randomized clinical trial was conducted at recruiting centers in Spain from October 2013 to December 2016. Men and women (aged 55-75 years) with metabolic syndrome and overweight or obesity, as well as access to dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (from 4 centers in Navarra, Mallorca, Reus, and León), were included in this prespecified secondary analysis. The analysis was conducted from September 1 to October 30, 2024. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to the intervention or the control. The intervention group followed an energy-reduced Mediterranean diet and increased physical activity, whereas the control group was advised to follow an ad libitum Mediterranean diet with no physical activity promotion. BMD (total femur, lumbar spine [L1-L4], and femoral trochanter) and total BMC were measured using DXA at baseline and at 1 and 3 years of follow-up. T scores from BMD variables were determined, and osteopenia or osteoporosis status was defined as low BMD. Linear and logistic 2-level mixed models were used for main analyses including participants lost to follow-up. Intention-to-treat analysis, completers case analysis, and sensitivity analysis were additionally performed. This study included 924 older adults (mean [SD] age, 65.1 [5.0] years; 454 women [49.1%] and 470 men [50.9%]). Significant differences in mean changes between groups were observed, with an overall 3-year intervention increase in the intervention group (n = 460) compared with the control group (n = 464) in lumbar spine (L1-L4) BMD (between-group differences, -0.1 [95% CI, -0.8 to 0.8] g/cm2 after 1 year and 0.9 [95% CI, 0.1-1.8] g/cm2 after 3 years; overall P = .05). This protective association was observed for women (between-group differences, -0.1 [95% CI, -1.3 to 1.1] g/cm2 after 1 year and 1.8 [95% CI, 0.6-2.9] g/cm2 after 3 years; overall P = .005) but not for men. No overall 3-year intervention effect on total BMC and low BMD prevalence was observed. In the PREDIMED-Plus trial, an energy-reduced Mediterranean diet and physical activity lifestyle intervention mitigated weight loss- and age-related BMD decline among older women with metabolic syndrome compared with conventional ad libitum Mediterranean diet recommendations.

It was previously reported that aging-related alterations in protein degradation, chronic inflammation, and deterioration of mitochondrial metabolism affect the acceleration of muscle atrophy in the elderly. However, the detailed mechanism or substantial causes for age-related muscle loss are still lacking, yet exercise or an increment in dietary protein intake are suggested as effective approaches to mitigate muscle atrophy. This study aims to investigate the regulatory effect of black soybean (<i>Rhynchosia nulubilis</i>) and black rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) mixture extract (BBME), which are rich in protein and bioactive compounds, in 12-month-old aged mice and L6 myotubes. BBME was orally administered at 300 and 600 mg/kg/day (low and high doses) for 12 weeks, and its effects on systemic glucose homeostasis and skeletal muscle metabolism were evaluated. Consequently, BBME at a high dose marginally ameliorated muscle loss and significantly improved glucose metabolism. BBME also reduced cellular senescence markers and enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis in aged skeletal muscles. Additionally, BBME exerted insulin-like activity by promoting glucose metabolism in L6 myotubes. These findings suggest the potential of BBME as a functional food ingredient in alleviating aging-induced muscle loss by modulating mitochondrial activity and glucose metabolism.",Park H; Yu S; Kim W,Frontiers in immunology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40176811/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Potential preventive/therapeutic interventions also include lifestyle changes like nutrition & diet, exercise, leisure and social engagement. Here, we discuss several lifestyle interventions for healthy brain aging, and in older adults with NDs. Balanced diets like the Mediterranean and MIND diets can reduce cognitive decline during aging. Long-term use of specific nutrient combinations in medical food may also exert benefits on memory. Metabolic interventions like calorie restriction (CR) and intermittent fasting (IF) have shown potential benefits in aging. However, their effects on cognitive function in older adults were modestly explored and remain unclear. Clinical trials are ongoing to test the cognitive and health outcomes of CR/IF variants in older adults with AD or PD (associated or not with metabolic disorders). We also highlight the role of cognitive reserve (CoR) in delaying dementia symptoms. Engaging in diverse leisure activities like music and bilingualism may enhance CoR and reduce AD risk. Finally, we outline future directions for promoting healthy brain aging through lifestyle interventions (e.g., personalized diets, precision nutrition, synergistic lifestyle approaches, AI-based technologies to monitor the effectiveness of lifestyle practices).",Popescu I; Lenain M; Rovini E; Ruthsatz M,American journal of lifestyle medicine,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40161281/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40077631,Study on the Differences in the Thirst-Quenching Effects of Different Beverages Supplemented Before Exercise: A Randomized Crossover Trial.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Different beverages may vary in their effectiveness at quenching thirst. This study aims to explore the impact of pre-exercise consumption of different types of beverages on thirst relief, providing scientific evidence to guide the selection of the most suitable beverage type. <b>Methods:</b> A randomized crossover design was used, recruiting 13 healthy male college students as participants. Each participant completed five exercise trials, with a 7-day interval between trials. In random order, participants consumed 6 mL/kg body weight of water, carbonated beverage, juice, electrolyte drink, or tea before exercise in each trial. Blood, saliva, and urine samples were collected before and after exercise; body weight was measured, and thirst sensation was recorded. <b>Results:</b> Body weight significantly decreased in all groups post-exercise (<i>p</i> < 0.05), with no significant differences between the beverage groups (<i>p</i> > 0.05). Post-exercise, serum Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations significantly decreased in all beverage groups, with the electrolyte drink group showing a significantly different change compared to the other groups (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Serum K<sup>+</sup> concentrations significantly increased post-exercise only in the electrolyte drink group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). No consistent trend was observed in the changes in serum Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations before and after exercise. Serum Cl<sup>-</sup> concentrations post-exercise were significantly lower than pre-exercise in all groups except the electrolyte drink group (Group E) (<i>p</i> < 0.05). All five hydration protocols resulted in a decrease in plasma volume. There was no consistent pattern in the changes in urine osmolality before and after exercise. Salivary osmolality significantly increased post-exercise in all groups (<i>p</i> < 0.05). In terms of subjective thirst, the water supplementation group had the highest score. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study indicates that electrolyte drinks are more effective in maintaining physiological balance, while water is most effective in alleviating subjective thirst. The impact of different beverages on subjective thirst did not fully align with changes in physiological markers, suggesting that future research should comprehensively evaluate the relationship between subjective sensations and physiological changes.",Gao J; Wang Y; Ren X; Nie Y; Li Y; Zhang Y; Huang S; Zhu D,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40077631/,0,0,0,0,1,0
39997062,The Human Energy Balance: Uncovering the Hidden Variables of Obesity.,"Obesity has emerged as a global epidemic, creating an increased burden of weight-related diseases and straining healthcare systems worldwide. While the fundamental principle of energy balance-caloric intake versus expenditure-remains central to weight regulation, real-world outcomes often deviate from simplistic predictions due to a multitude of physiological and environmental factors. Genetic predispositions, variations in basal metabolic rates, adaptive thermogenesis, physical activity, and nutrient losses via fecal and urinary excretion contribute to interindividual differences in energy homeostasis. Additionally, factors such as meal timing, macronutrient composition, gut microbiota dynamics, and diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) further modulate energy utilization and metabolic efficiency. This Perspective explores key physiological determinants of the energy balance, while also highlighting the clinical significance of thrifty versus spendthrifty metabolic phenotypes. Key strategies for individualized weight management include precision calorimetry, circadian-aligned meal timing, the use of protein- and whole food diets to enhance DIT, and increases in non-exercise activity, as well as mild cold exposure and the use of thermogenic agents (e.g., capsaicin-like compounds) to stimulate brown adipose tissue activity. A comprehensive, personalized approach to obesity management that moves beyond restrictive caloric models is essential to achieving sustainable weight control and improving long-term metabolic health. Integrating these multifactorial insights into clinical practice will enhance obesity treatment strategies, fostering more effective and enduring interventions.",Theodorakis N; Nikolaou M,"Diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39997062/,0,0,0,0,0,0

We examined the associations of CKM stages with premature mortality and the role of social determinants of health (SDOHs). A prospective cohort study. A nationally representative sample of US adults from NHANES 1999-2018. CKM included 5 stages (stages 0-4), reflecting progressive pathophysiology. Premature mortality (deaths before 75 years) were ascertained via linkage to the National Death Index with follow-up until 2019. Cox proportional-hazards models adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, medical history, and other confounding factors were used to calculate the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs for CKM-mortality associations. Among 27,909 participants (mean age 49.7 years, 49.0% females), 1762 premature deaths occurred over a median follow-up of 8.3 years. Compared with stage 0, the adjusted HRs for all-cause premature mortality at CKM stages 1-4 were 0.88 (95% CI 0.66-1.17), 1.31 (0.99-1.73), 1.94 (1.31-2.87), and 2.19 (1.61-2.98), respectively. For CVD premature mortality, the adjusted HRs for CKM stages 1-4 were 1.12 (0.46-2.72), 1.74 (0.71-4.28), 3.93 (1.53-10.12), and 6.48 (2.95-14.20), respectively. Among adults at CKM stages 3-4, unfavorable SDOHs, particularly not living with a partner, low family income, lack of private health insurance, unemployment, or ≥2 cumulative SDOHs (4.16, 95% CI 3.35-5.18) were associated with increased all-cause premature mortality. Among those at CKM stages 0-2, unfavorable SDOHs were also related to increased premature mortality.

Determinants may include genetics, current dietary habits and eating patterns, circadian rhythms, health status, gut microbiome, socioeconomic and psychosocial characteristics, and physical activity. ​​​​In this systematic review, we examined the evidence base for the effect of interventions based on precision nutrition approaches on overweight and obesity in children and adolescents to help inform future research and global guidelines. To examine the impact of precision nutrition-based interventions for the management of obesity in children and adolescents in all their diversity. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science Core Collection, BIOSIS Previews, Global Index Medicus (all regions), IBECS, SciELO, PAHO, PAHO IRIS, WHO IRIS, WHOLIS, Bibliomap, and TRoPHI, as well as the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov. We last searched the databases on 23 July 2024. We did not apply any language restrictions. We included randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that evaluated precision nutrition-based interventions (accounting for 'omics' such as phenotyping, genotyping, gut microbiome; clinical data, baseline dietary intake, postprandial glucose response, etc., and/or including artificial intelligence such as machine learning methods) compared to general or one-size-fits-all interventions or no intervention in children and adolescents aged 0 to 9 years or 10 to 19 years with overweight or obesity. Two review authors independently conducted study screening, data extraction, and risk of bias and GRADE assessments. We used fixed-effect analyses. Our outcomes of interest were physical and mental well-being, physical activity, health-related quality of life, obesity-associated disability, and adverse events associated with the interventions as defined or measured by trialists, and weight change (reduction, stabilisation or maintenance). Two studies (3 references, 105 participants) conducted in Ukraine and Greece met our eligibility criteria. One study reported nonprofit funding sources, whilst the other did not report funding, and the certainty of evidence ranged from very low to low across outcomes (all measured at endpoint). Only one trial (65 participants) contributed data on our primary outcomes of interest. Precision nutrition-based intervention versus one-size-fits-all intervention or standard of care In children 0 to 9 years of age, evidence is very uncertain about the effect of a precision nutrition-based intervention (a computerised Decision Support Tool (DST) that incorporates a variety of participant data and provides personalised diet recommendations based on decision-tree algorithms) on body mass index (BMI) (mean difference (MD) -1.40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.48 to 0.68; 1 study, 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and on weight (MD -2.60 kg, 95% CI -8.42 to 3.22; 1 study, 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence) compared with a one-size-fits-all control intervention. In children and adolescents 10 to 19 years of age, evidence is very uncertain about the effect of a precision nutrition-based intervention (computerised DST) on BMI (MD 3.00 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95% CI -0.26 to 6.26; 1 study, 30 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and on weight (MD 11.40 kg, 95% CI -0.47 to 23.27; 1 study, 30 participants; very low-certainty evidence) compared with a one-size-fits-all control intervention. Based on data from two small studies with a total of 105 participants, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of precision nutrition-based interventions on body weight or BMI. This review was limited by the number of available randomised controlled trials in this relatively nascent field. Given these limitations, the two studies do not provide sufficient evidence to adequately inform practice. Future research should report participant outcome data, including outcomes related to mental, emotional, and functional well-being, in addition to biochemical and physical measures, stratified by World Health Organization-defined age groups (children (0 to 9 years), and children and adolescents (10 to 19 years)). Future studies should also report methods related to randomisation, blinding, and compliance, as well as include prespecified analysis plans.",Huey SL; Mehta NH; Steinhouse RS; Jin Y; Kibbee M; Kuriyan R; Finkelstein JL; Mehta S,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39882755/,0,1,0,1,0,0
39856244,Diurnal timing of physical activity in relation to obesity and diabetes in the German National Cohort (NAKO).,"Physical activity supports weight regulation and metabolic health, but its timing in relation to obesity and diabetes remains unclear. We aimed to assess the diurnal timing of physical activity and its association with obesity and diabetes. We cross-sectionally analyzed hip-worn accelerometry data from 61,116 participants aged 20-75 in the German National Cohort between 2015 and 2019. We divided physical activity into sex- and age-standardized quartiles of total morning (06:00-11:59), afternoon (12:00-17:59), evening (18:00-23:59), and nighttime (00:00-06:00) physical activity. Using multivariable logistic regression, we estimated associations of physical activity timing with obesity (BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and diabetes (self-reported or HbA1c ≥ 6.5%). We accounted for sex, age, study region, education, employment, risky alcohol use, smoking, night shift work, and sleep duration. High afternoon (top vs. bottom quartile, OR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.33-0.38) and evening physical activity (OR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.42-0.48) showed lower obesity odds than high morning activity (OR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.66-0.76), whereas nighttime activity increased obesity odds (OR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.48-1.68). Associations were similar for diabetes, with the lowest odds for afternoon (OR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.42-0.53), followed by evening (OR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.50-0.62) and morning activity (OR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.71-0.89), and higher odds for nighttime activity (OR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.29-1.58). Findings were not modified by employment status, night shift work, and sleep duration. Our cross-sectional findings require longitudinal corroboration but suggest afternoon and evening activity provide greater metabolic health benefits than morning activity, while nighttime activity is discouraged.",Stein MJ; Weber A; Bamberg F; Baurecht H; Berger K; Bohmann P; Brenner H; Brummer J; Dörr M; Fischer B; Gastell S; Greiser KH; Harth V; Hebestreit A; Heise JK; Herbolsheimer F; Ittermann T; Karch A; Keil T; Kluttig A; Krist L; Michels KB; Mikolajczyk R; Nauck M; Nimptsch K; Obi N; Pischon T; Pivovarova-Ramich O; Schikowski T; Schmidt B; Schulze MB; Steindorf K; Zylla S; Leitzmann MF,International journal of obesity (2005),2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39856244/,0,0,0,0,0,1
39811913,A menu for microbes: unraveling appetite regulation and weight dynamics through the microbiota-brain connection across the lifespan.,"Appetite, as the internal drive for food intake, is often dysregulated in a broad spectrum of conditions associated with over- and under-nutrition across the lifespan. Appetite regulation is a complex, integrative process comprising psychological and behavioral events, peripheral and metabolic inputs, and central neurotransmitter and metabolic interactions. The microbiota-gut-brain axis has emerged as a critical mediator of multiple physiological processes, including energy metabolism, brain function, and behavior. Therefore, the role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in appetite and obesity is receiving increased attention. Omics approaches such as genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics in appetite and weight regulation offer new opportunities for featuring obesity phenotypes. Furthermore, gut-microbiota-targeted approaches such as pre-, pro-, post-, and synbiotic, personalized nutrition, and fecal microbiota transplantation are novel avenues for precision treatments. The aim of this narrative review is <i>1</i>) to provide an overview of the role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in appetite regulation across the lifespan and <i>2</i>) to discuss the potential of omics and gut microbiota-targeted approaches to deepen understanding of appetite regulation and obesity.",Ribeiro G; Schellekens H; Cuesta-Marti C; Maneschy I; Ismael S; Cuevas-Sierra A; Martínez JA; Silvestre MP; Marques C; Moreira-Rosário A; Faria A; Moreno LA; Calhau C,American journal of physiology.

39800617,"Prospective association of changes in (poly)phenol intake, body weight and physical activity with inflammatory profile.","To prospectively evaluate the associations between changes in (poly)phenol intake, body weight(BW), and physical activity(PA) with changes in an inflammatory score after 1-year. This is a prospective observational analysis involving 484 participants from the PREDIMED-Plus with available inflammatory measurements. (Poly)phenol intake was estimated using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire and the Phenol-Explorer database. An inflammatory score was calculated based on 8 blood biomarkers (IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, MCP-1, C-peptide, hs-CRP, leptin, and RANTES). The association between BW, PA, (poly)phenol intake and inflammatory score was evaluated using structural equations. Mediation analyses were performed to assess the relationship between change in (poly)phenol intake and inflammatory score was mediated by the change in BW. A higher increase in total (poly)phenol intake was related to a decrease in the inflammatory score (β = -0.005mg/1000 Kcal; CI95 % = -0.100,0.000) along with a decrease in BW (β = -0.006mg/1000 Kcal; CI95 % = -0.010,-0.003). Increased PA was associated with a lower inflammatory score (β = -0.129MET-min/d; CI95 % = -0.238,-0.021) and BW (β = -0.248MET-min/d; CI95 % = -0.343,-0.152). Finally, a decrease in BW was associated with a decrease in the inflammatory score (β = 0.240 kg; CI95 % = 0.155,0.325). Mediation analyses revealed that changes in BW explained 22 % of the overall association between changes in (poly)phenol intake and inflammatory score. An inverse association between changes in (poly)phenol intake and inflammatory status was observed, with BW playing a significant mediating role, emphasising the impact of BW reduction on inflammation reduction.",Rubín-García M; Vitelli-Storelli F; Álvarez-Álvarez L; Fitó M; Vázquez-Ruiz Z; Salas-Salvadó J; Corella D; Serra-Majem L; Warnberg J; Romaguera D; Estruch R; Pintó X; Martínez JA; Vázquez C; Vidal J; Tur JA; Alonso-Gómez ÁM; Ros E; Vioque J; López-Miranda J; Bueno-Cavanillas A; Tinahones FJ; Lapetra J; Daimiel L; Delgado-Rodríguez M; Matía-Martín P; Babio N; Schröder H; Lamuela-Raventós RM; Martín-Sánchez V; Zamora-Ros R,"Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39800617/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39769203,Beyond Calories: Individual Metabolic and Hormonal Adaptations Driving Variability in Weight Management-A State-of-the-Art Narrative Review.,"The global rise in obesity underscores the need for effective weight management strategies that address individual metabolic and hormonal variability, moving beyond the simplistic ""calories in, calories out"" model. Body types-ectomorph, mesomorph, and endomorph-provide a framework for understanding the differences in fat storage, muscle development, and energy expenditure, as each type responds uniquely to caloric intake and exercise. Variability in weight outcomes is influenced by factors such as genetic polymorphisms and epigenetic changes in hormonal signaling pathways and metabolic processes, as well as lifestyle factors, including nutrition, exercise, sleep, and stress. These factors impact the magnitude of lipogenesis and myofibrillar protein synthesis during overfeeding, as well as the extent of lipolysis and muscle proteolysis during caloric restriction, through complex mechanisms that involve changes in the resting metabolic rate, metabolic pathways, and hormonal profiles. Precision approaches, such as nutrigenomics, indirect calorimetry, and artificial-intelligence-based strategies, can potentially leverage these insights to create individualized weight management strategies aligned with each person's unique metabolic profile. By addressing these personalized factors, precision nutrition offers a promising pathway to sustainable and effective weight management outcomes. The main objective of this review is to examine the metabolic and hormonal adaptations driving variability in weight management outcomes and explore how precision nutrition can address these challenges through individualized strategies.",Theodorakis N; Kreouzi M; Pappas A; Nikolaou M,International journal of molecular sciences,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39769203/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39767255,Health and Liver Diagnostic Markers Influencing Glycemia in Subjects with Prediabetes: Preview Study.,"Glucose homeostasis may be dependent on liver conditions and influence health-related markers and quality of life (QoL) objective measurements. This study aimed to analyze the interactions of glycemia with liver and health status in a prediabetic population. This study included 2220 overweight/obese prediabetics from the multinational PREVIEW project. Anthropometrics; clinical, metabolic and other health-related markers; and QoL variables were analyzed. Univariate and multilinear-adjusted regression models were run to explain the interrelationships and effect modification between glycemia, health-related QoL (applying SF-12) and metabolic/liver health (using the HSI, a putative marker of fatty liver). Relevant age/sex interactions were found concerning the levels of insulin, HOMA-IR, C peptide and transaminases in this prediabetic population. Multivariate models identified age, sex, glucose, WC and QoL as important predictors of HSI variability (adj. R value = 0.1393, <i>p</i> < 0.001), whereas the QoL status was statistically related to age, sex, HOMA-IR and HSI (adj. R value = 0.1130, <i>p</i> < 0.001) in this glycemia-impaired group. Furthermore, the QoL values declined with increased HSI scores, where a significant interaction was found (<i>p</i> = 0.011) when the data were analyzed when comparing lower glycemia vs. higher glycemia in prediabetics. Indeed, an effect modification was featured depending on the glycemia levels concerning the QoL and HSI worsening. Glycemia associations with the QoL status and liver metabolism markers were evidenced, with clinical implications for diabetes and liver disease precision management given the modification of the QoL outcomes depending on the liver status and glycemia concentrations. Notably, independent associations of circulating glucose with age, sex, adiposity, inflammation and C peptide levels were found.",Ramos-Lopez O; Martinez-Urbistondo D; Navas-Carretero S; Zhu R; Huttunen-Lenz M; Stratton G; Handjieva-Darlenska T; Handjiev S; Sundvall JE; Silvestre MP; Jalo E; Pietiläinen KH; Adam TC; Westerterp-Plantenga M; Simpson E; MacDonald I; Taylor MA; Poppitt SD; Schlicht W; Brand-Miller J; Fogelholm M; Raben A; Martinez JA,"Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39767255/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39611279,Why protein-energy wasting leads to faster progression of chronic kidney disease.,"Protein-energy wasting (PEW) is increasingly more prevalent as chronic kidney disease (CKD) progresses to more advanced stages. There is a global recognition of the importance of preventing and mitigating PEW in the CKD population not on dialysis given the goal of extending dialysis-free time and delaying dialysis initiation and growing evidence of the clinical consequences of PEW which include the risk of death, hospitalization and clinical conditions such as infections. We reviewed the association of PEW and the malnutrition characteristics indicative of PEW on CKD progression. Studies show the association between low serum albumin levels, low BMI, and diets with inadequate dietary energy and protein intake and CKD progression. Limited studies suggest low muscle mass impacts CKD progression. Optimizing nutrition by dietary management, including a moderately low protein (0.6-0.8 g/kg/day) and plant-based (>50% of protein source, known as PLADO) diet and as needed with supplementation [e.g. during acute kidney injury (AKI) event] administrated orally, enterally, or parenterally are the basis for the prevention and treatment of PEW in CKD and delaying CKD progression. Furthermore, other therapeutic methods such as treating or avoiding comorbidities and AKI, ensuring appropriate exercise and incremental transition to dialysis treatment may help ameliorate and prevent PEW development in CKD patients. Using tailored precision nutrition approaches and nutritional supplementation with or without other beneficial strategies may help prevent and treat PEW and its consequent occurrence of CKD progression.",Narasaki Y; Rhee CM; Kalantar-Zadeh K; Rastegar M,Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39611279/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39505926,GDF15 is required for maintaining subcutaneous adipose tissue lipid metabolic signature.,"Recent research has identified growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) as a crucial factor in various physiological and pathological processes, particularly in energy balance regulation. While the role of GDF15 in modulating energy metabolism through hindbrain GDNF family receptor alpha-like (GFRAL) signaling has been extensively studied, emerging evidence suggests direct peripheral metabolic actions of GDF15. Using knockout mouse models, we investigated GDF15 and GFRAL's roles in adipose tissue metabolism. Our findings indicate that C57BL/6/129/SvJ Gdf15-KO mice exhibit impaired expression of de novo lipogenesis enzymes in subcutaneous adipose tissue (sWAT). In contrast, C57BL/6J Gfral-KO mice showed no impairments compared to wild-type (WT) littermates. RNA-Seq analysis of sWAT in Gdf15-KO mice revealed a broad downregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism. Importantly, our study uncovered sex-specific effects, with females being more affected by GDF15 loss than males. Additionally, we observed a fasting-induced upregulation of GDF15 gene expression in sWAT of both mice and humans, reinforcing this factor's role in adipose tissue lipid metabolism. In conclusion, our research highlights an essential role for GDF15 in sWAT lipid metabolic homeostasis. These insights enhance our understanding of GDF15's functions in adipose tissue physiology and underscore its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic disorders.",Igual-Gil C; Bishop CA; Jähnert M; Johann K; Coleman V; Baum V; Kruse M; Pfeiffer AFH; Pivovarova-Ramich O; Ost M; Kleinert M; Klaus S,Scientific reports,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39505926/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39384179,Effect of a Multifactorial Weight Loss Intervention on HDL Cholesterol Efflux Capacity and Immunosenescence: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Life expectancy and obesity prevalence are increasing worldwide, leading to an increase in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) functionality and immunosenescence play key roles in cardiovascular disease, longevity, and quality of aging. Both molecular hallmarks of aging are impacted by obesity and metabolic syndrome and can be modulated by lifestyle. We aimed to evaluate the effect of a lifestyle intervention focused on an energy-reduced Mediterranean diet (erMedDiet), physical activity (PA), and behavioral support on HDL cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) and immunosenescence. CEC and immunosenescent T cells were determined in 60 participants from the control group (CG) and 56 from the intervention group (IG) of the PREDIMED-Plus trial at baseline and after 1 and 3 years of follow-up. PREDIMED-Plus is a randomized, controlled, parallel-group trial with an IG of erMedDiet, PA promotion, and behavioral support for weight loss and a CG of usual primary care advice. The sample included 116 volunteers from the PREDIMED-Plus-IMDEA subsample of the PREDIMED-Plus trial. Men aged 55 to 75 years and women aged 60 to 75 years with a body mass index between 27 and 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and metabolic syndrome were included. Participants within the IG had significantly improved CEC (2.42% and 10.69% after 1 and 3 years of follow-up) and a decreased in senescent T cell profile (-3.32% ± 12.54% and -6.74% ± 11.2%, <i>p</i> < 0.001, after 1 and 3 years of follow-up).

39283705,A Systematic Review of the Effect of Gene-Lifestyle Interactions on Metabolic-Disease-Related Traits in South Asian Populations.,"Recent data from the South Asian subregion have raised concern about the dramatic increase in the prevalence of metabolic diseases, which are influenced by genetic and lifestyle factors. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the contemporary evidence for the effect of gene-lifestyle interactions on metabolic outcomes in this population. PubMed, Web of Science, and SCOPUS databases were searched up until March 2023 for observational and intervention studies investigating the interaction between genetic variants and lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity on obesity and type 2 diabetes traits. Of the 14 783 publications extracted, 15 were deemed eligible for inclusion in this study. Data extraction was carried out independently by 3 investigators. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Appraisal Tool for Cross-Sectional Studies (AXIS), the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I), and the methodological quality score for nutrigenetics studies. Using a narrative synthesis approach, the findings were presented in textual and tabular format. Together, studies from India (n = 8), Pakistan (n = 3), Sri Lanka (n = 1), and the South Asian diaspora in Singapore and Canada (n = 3) reported 543 gene-lifestyle interactions, of which 132 (∼24%) were statistically significant. These results were related to the effects of the interaction of genetic factors with physical inactivity, poor sleep habits, smoking, and dietary intake of carbohydrates, protein, and fat on the risk of metabolic disease in this population. The findings of this systematic review provide evidence of gene-lifestyle interactions impacting metabolic traits within the South Asian population. However, the lack of replication and correction for multiple testing and the small sample size of the included studies may limit the conclusiveness of the evidence.

39064785,Hydrogen-Rich Gas Enhanced Sprint-Interval Performance: Metabolomic Insights into Underlying Mechanisms.,"(1) Background: The diversity of blood biomarkers used to assess the metabolic mechanisms of hydrogen limits a comprehensive understanding of its effects on improving exercise performance. This study evaluated the impact of hydrogen-rich gas (HRG) on metabolites following sprint-interval exercise using metabolomics approaches, aiming to elucidate its underlying mechanisms of action. (2) Methods: Ten healthy adult males participated in the Wingate Sprint-interval test (SIT) following 60 min of HRG or placebo (air) inhalation. Venous blood samples were collected for metabolomic analysis both before and after gas inhalation and subsequent to completing the SIT. (3) Results: Compared with the placebo, HRG inhalation significantly improved mean power, fatigue index, and time to peak for the fourth sprint and significantly reduced the attenuation values of peak power, mean power, and time to peak between the first and fourth. Metabolomic analysis highlighted the significant upregulation of acetylcarnitine, propionyl-L-carnitine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine upon HRG inhalation, with enrichment pathway analysis suggesting that HRG may foster fat mobilization by enhancing coenzyme A synthesis, promoting glycerophospholipid metabolism, and suppressing insulin levels. (4) Conclusions: Inhaling HRG before an SIT enhances end-stage anaerobic sprint capabilities and mitigates fatigue. Metabolomic analysis suggests that HRG may enhance ATP recovery during interval stages by accelerating fat oxidation, providing increased energy replenishment for late-stage sprints.",Dong G; Liu H; Chen Y; Bao D; Xu W; Zhou J,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39064785/,0,0,0,0,1,0
38999747,More Adult Women than Men at High Cardiometabolic Risk Reported Worse Lifestyles and Self-Reported Health Status in the COVID-19 Lockdown.,"The COVID-19 lockdown represented an immense impact on human health, which was characterized by lifestyle and dietary changes, social distancing and isolation at home. Some evidence suggests that these consequences mainly affected women and altered relevant ongoing clinical trials. The aim of this study was to evaluate the status and changes in diet, physical activity (PA), sleep and self-reported health status (SRH) as perceived by older adult men and women with metabolic syndrome during the COVID-19 lockdown. We analyzed data from 4681 Spanish adults with metabolic syndrome. We carried out a telephone survey during May and June 2020 to collect information on demographics, dietary habits, PA, sleep, SRH and anthropometric data. The mean age of participants was 64.9 years at recruitment, and 52% of participants were men. Most participants (64.1%) perceived a decrease in their PA during confinement. Regarding gender-specific differences, a higher proportion of women than men perceived a decrease in their PA (67.5% vs. 61.1%), Mediterranean diet adherence (20.9% vs. 16.8%), sleep hours (30.3% vs. 19.1%), sleep quality (31.6% vs. 18.2%) and SRH (25.9% vs. 11.9%) (all <i>p</i> < 0.001).

Here, we update current concepts and provide a comprehensive overview of BFIs measured in urine and blood. We rank BFIs based on a four-level utility scale to guide selection and identify combinations of BFIs that specifically reflect complex food intakes, making them applicable as dietary instruments. We discuss the main challenges in biomarker development and illustrate key solutions for the application of BFIs in human studies, highlighting different strategies for selecting and combining BFIs to support specific study designs.

However, the precise interplay between diet and exercise impacting body composition remains unclear, challenging personalized interventions. This study aimed to explore potential interactions and effect modifications of these factors affecting the body mass index (BMI) within an online adult cohort. Data from 11,883 NUTRiMDEA cohort participants were analyzed in this cross-sectional study, categorizing individuals by age, sex, and BMI using linear regression models to assess the interactions between lifestyle factors and adiposity. Significant differences emerged in anthropometry, lifestyle, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) across categories. The combined effect of diet and physical activity had a greater impact on BMI than physical activity or Mediterranean diet adherence alone, with lower BMI as physical activity levels increased (<i>β</i>: -0.5) and adherence to the Mediterranean diet decreased, where a modification effect between them was identified (<i>β</i>: -0.28). Participants with lower Mediterranean diet adherence displayed superior BMI when physical activity was low, but when activity levels were higher, their BMI aligned with those with healthier dietary habits. An interaction link between lifestyle factors and BMI was found, showing the differential effects of the Mediterranean diet and physical activity combination concerning adiposity.",Higuera-Gómez A; de Cuevillas B; Ribot-Rodríguez R; San-Cristobal R; de la O V; Dos Santos K; Cuevas-Sierra A; Martínez JA,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38892710/,0,0,0,0,0,0

This <i>post-hoc</i> analysis of a 12-month randomized controlled trial aimed to identify the relationship among the gut microbiome, immune responses, and bone protective effects of prunes on postmenopausal women. Subjects who consumed 50-100 g prunes daily were divided into responders (<i>n</i> = 20) and non-responders (<i>n</i> = 32) based on percent change in total hip bone mineral density (BMD, ≥1% or ≤-1% change, respectively). DXA scans were used to determine body composition and BMD. Immune markers were measured using immunoassays and flow cytometry. Targeted phenolic metabolites were analyzed using ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The fecal microbiota was characterized through 16S rRNA gene PCR amplicon sequencing. After 12 months of prune consumption, anti-inflammatory markers showed responders had significantly lower levels of IL-1β and TNF-α. QIIME2 sequence analysis showed that microbiomes of responders and non-responders differed in alpha (Shannon and Faith PD, Kruskal-Wallis <i>p</i> < 0.05) and beta diversity (unweighted Unifrac, PERMANOVA <i>p</i> < 0.04) metrics both before and after prune treatment. Furthermore, responders had a higher abundance of bacterial families Oscillospiraceae and Lachnospiraceae (ANCOM-BC <i>p</i> < 0.05). These findings provide evidence that postmenopausal women with initial low BMD can benefit from prunes if they host certain gut microbes. These insights can guide precision nutrition strategies to improve BMD tailored to diet and microbiome composition.",Simpson AMR; De Souza MJ; Damani J; Rogers CJ; Williams NI; Weaver CM; Ferruzzi MG; Nakatsu CH,Frontiers in nutrition,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38706560/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38674256,Nutritional and Lifestyle Features in a Mediterranean Cohort: An Epidemiological Instrument for Categorizing Metabotypes Based on a Computational Algorithm.,"<i>Background and Objectives:</i> Modern classification and categorization of individuals' health requires personalized variables such as nutrition, physical activity, lifestyle, and medical data through advanced analysis and clustering methods involving machine learning tools. The objective of this project was to categorize Mediterranean dwellers' health factors and design metabotypes to provide personalized well-being in order to develop professional implementation tools in addition to characterizing nutritional and lifestyle features in such populations. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> A two-phase observational study was conducted by the Pharmacists Council to identify Spanish nutritional and lifestyle characteristics. Adults over 18 years of age completed questionnaires on general lifestyle habits, dietary patterns (FFQ, MEDAS-17 p), physical activity (IPAQ), quality of life (SF-12), and validated well-being indices (LS7, MEDLIFE, HHS, MHL). Subsequently, exploratory factor, clustering, and random forest analysis methods were conducted to objectively define the metabotypes considering population determinants. <i>Results:</i> A total of 46.4% of the sample (<i>n</i> = 5496) had moderate-to-high adherence to the Mediterranean diet (>8 points), while 71% of the participants declared that they had moderate physical activity. Almost half of the volunteers had a good self-perception of health (49.9%). Regarding lifestyle index, population LS7 showed a fair cardiovascular health status (7.9 ± 1.7), as well as moderate quality of life by MEDLIFE (9.3 ± 2.6) and MHL scores (2.4 ± 0.8). In addition, five metabotype models were developed based on 26 variables: Westernized Millennial (28.6%), healthy (25.1%), active Mediterranean (16.5%), dysmetabolic/pre-morbid (11.5%), and metabolically vulnerable/pro-morbid (18.3%). <i>Conclusions:</i> The support of tools related to precision nutrition and lifestyle integrates well-being characteristics and contributes to reducing the impact of unhealthy lifestyle habits with practical implications for primary care. Combining lifestyle, metabolic, and quality of life traits will facilitate personalized precision interventions and the implementation of targeted public health policies.",García-Perea A; Fernández-Cruz E; de la O-Pascual V; Gonzalez-Zorzano E; Moreno-Aliaga MJ; Tur JA; Martinez JA,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38674256/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38618550,"Effects of a 5-week intake of erythritol and xylitol on vascular function, abdominal fat and glucose tolerance in humans with obesity: a pilot trial.","Previous studies in humans and rats suggest that erythritol might positively affect vascular function, xylitol decrease visceral fat mass and both substances improve glycaemic control. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of a 5-week intake of erythritol and xylitol on vascular function, abdominal fat and blood lipids, glucose tolerance, uric acid, hepatic enzymes, creatinine, gastrointestinal tolerance and dietary patterns in humans with obesity. Forty-two participants were randomised to consume either 36 g erythritol, 24 g xylitol, or no substance daily for 5 weeks. Before and after the intervention, arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity, arteriolar-to-venular diameter ratio), abdominal fat (liver volume, liver fat percentage, visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue, blood lipids), glucose tolerance (glucose and insulin concentrations), uric acid, hepatic enzymes, creatinine, gastrointestinal tolerance and dietary patterns were assessed. Data were analysed by linear mixed effect model. The 5-week intake of erythritol and xylitol showed no statistically significant effect on vascular function. Neither the time nor the treatment effects were significantly different for pulse wave velocity (time effect: p=0.079, Cohen's D (95% CI) -0.14 (-0.54-0.25); treatment effect: p=0.792, Cohen's D (95% CI) control versus xylitol: -0.11 (-0.61-0.35), control versus erythritol: 0.05 (0.44-0.54), erythritol versus xylitol: 0.07 (-0.41-0.54)). There was no statistically significant effect on abdominal fat, glucose tolerance, uric acid, hepatic enzymes and creatinine. Gastrointestinal tolerance was good except for a few diarrhoea-related symptoms. Participants of all groups reduced their consumption of sweetened beverages and sweets compared with preintervention.

38512828,Combining diaries and accelerometers to explain change in physical activity during a lifestyle intervention for adults with pre-diabetes: A PREVIEW sub-study.,"Self-report and device-based measures of physical activity (PA) both have unique strengths and limitations; combining these measures should provide complementary and comprehensive insights to PA behaviours. Therefore, we aim to 1) identify PA clusters and clusters of change in PA based on self-reported daily activities and 2) assess differences in device-based PA between clusters in a lifestyle intervention, the PREVIEW diabetes prevention study. In total, 232 participants with overweight and prediabetes (147 women; 55.9 ± 9.5yrs; BMI ≥25 kg·m-2; impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance) were clustered using a partitioning around medoids algorithm based on self-reported daily activities before a lifestyle intervention and their changes after 6 and 12 months. Device-assessed PA levels (PAL), sedentary time (SED), light PA (LPA), and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) were assessed using ActiSleep+ accelerometers and compared between clusters using (multivariate) analyses of covariance. At baseline, the self-reported ""walking and housework"" cluster had significantly higher PAL, MVPA and LPA, and less SED than the ""inactive"" cluster. LPA was higher only among the ""cycling"" cluster. There was no difference in the device-based measures between the ""social-sports"" and ""inactive"" clusters. Looking at the changes after 6 months, the ""increased walking"" cluster showed the greatest increase in PAL while the ""increased cycling"" cluster accumulated the highest amount of LPA. The ""increased housework"" and ""increased supervised sports"" reported least favourable changes in device-based PA. After 12 months, there was only minor change in activities between the ""increased walking and cycling"", ""no change"" and ""increased supervised sports"" clusters, with no significant differences in device-based measures. Combining self-report and device-based measures provides better insights into the behaviours that change during an intervention.

However, AI has evolved with the introduction of transformer models, allowing analysis of the diverse, multimodal data sources existing in medicine today. Multimodal AI holds great promise in more accurate disease risk assessment and stratification as well as optimizing the key driving factors in cardiometabolic disease: blood pressure, sleep, stress, glucose control, weight, nutrition, and physical activity.

A secondary analysis of the behavior maintenance stage (6-36 months) of the 3-year PREVIEW intervention (PREVention of diabetes through lifestyle Intervention and population studies in Europe and around the World). Adults (n = 1,311) with overweight and prediabetes at preintervention baseline. Eating behavior (Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire), stress (Perceived Stress Scale), and dietary intake (4-day food records on 4 occasions) were reported. Associations between predictors and dietary outcomes were examined with linear mixed-effects models for repeated measurements. Eating behaviors and stress at 6 months did not predict the subsequent change in dietary outcomes, but higher cognitive restraint predicted lower energy intake, and both higher disinhibition and hunger predicted higher energy intake during the following behavior maintenance stage. In addition, higher disinhibition predicted higher saturated fat intake and lower fiber intake, and higher hunger predicted lower fiber intake. Stress was not associated with energy intake or dietary quality. Eating behaviors and stress were not consistently associated with adherence to dietary instructions. Higher cognitive restraint predicted lower energy intake (food quantity), but disinhibition and hunger were also associated with dietary quality.",Jalo E; Fogelholm M; Westerterp-Plantenga M; Adam TC; Drummen M; Huttunen-Lenz M; Kjølbæk L; Martinez JA; Handjieva-Darlenska T; Taylor MA; Brand-Miller J; Poppitt S; Stratton G; Lam T; Navas-Carretero S; Bogdanov G; Simpson L; Muirhead R; Silvestre MP; Swindell N; Raben A; Konttinen H,Journal of nutrition education and behavior,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38416096/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38316343,Potential Mechanisms of Precision Nutrition-Based Interventions for Managing Obesity.,"Precision nutrition (PN) considers multiple individual-level and environmental characteristics or variables to better inform dietary strategies and interventions for optimizing health, including managing obesity and metabolic disorders. Here, we review the evidence on potential mechanisms-including ones to identify individuals most likely to respond-that can be leveraged in the development of PN interventions addressing obesity. We conducted a review of the literature and included laboratory, animal, and human studies evaluating biochemical and genetic data, completed and ongoing clinical trials, and public programs in this review. Our analysis describes the potential mechanisms related to 6 domains including genetic predisposition, circadian rhythms, physical activity and sedentary behavior, metabolomics, the gut microbiome, and behavioral and socioeconomic characteristics, i.e., the factors that can be leveraged to design PN-based interventions to prevent and treat obesity-related outcomes such as weight loss or metabolic health as laid out by the NIH 2030 Strategic Plan for Nutrition Research. For example, single nucleotide polymorphisms can modify responses to certain dietary interventions, and epigenetic modulation of obesity risk via physical activity patterns and macronutrient intake have also been demonstrated. Additionally, we identified limitations including questions of equitable implementation across a limited number of clinical trials. These include the limited ability of current PN interventions to address systemic influences such as supply chains and food distribution, healthcare systems, racial or cultural inequities, and economic disparities, particularly when designing and implementing PN interventions in low- and middle-income communities. PN has the potential to help manage obesity by addressing intra- and inter-individual variation as well as context, as opposed to ""one-size fits all"" approaches though there is limited clinical trial evidence to date.",Mehta NH; Huey SL; Kuriyan R; Peña-Rosas JP; Finkelstein JL; Kashyap S; Mehta S,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38316343/,1,0,0,0,0,0

38143595,Beyond Diet and Exercise: The Impact of Gut Microbiota on Control of Obesity.,"Obesity, a widespread health concern characterized by the excessive accumulation of body fat, is a complex condition influenced by genetics, environment, and social determinants. Recent research has increasingly focused on the role of gut microbiota in obesity, highlighting its pivotal involvement in various metabolic processes. The gut microbiota, a diverse community of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, interacts with the host in a myriad of ways, impacting energy metabolism, appetite regulation, inflammation, and the gut-brain axis. Dietary choices significantly shape the gut microbiota, with diets high in fat and carbohydrates promoting the growth of harmful bacteria while reducing beneficial microbes. Lifestyle factors, like physical activity and smoking, also influence gut microbiota composition. Antibiotics and medications can disrupt microbial diversity, potentially contributing to obesity. Early-life experiences, including maternal obesity during pregnancy, play a vital role in the developmental origins of obesity. Therapeutic interventions targeting the gut microbiota, including prebiotics, probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, bacterial consortium therapy, and precision nutrition, offer promising avenues for reshaping the gut microbiota and positively influencing weight regulation and metabolic health. Clinical applications of microbiota-based therapies are on the horizon, with potential implications for personalized treatments and condition-based interventions. Emerging technologies, such as next-generation sequencing and advanced bioinformatics, empower researchers to identify specific target species for microbiota-based therapeutics, opening new possibilities in healthcare. Despite the promising outlook, microbiota-based therapies face challenges related to microbial selection, safety, and regulatory issues. However, with ongoing research and advances in the field, these challenges can be addressed to unlock the full potential of microbiota-based interventions.",Kamal FD; Dagar M; Reza T; Karim Mandokhail A; Bakht D; Shahzad MW; Silloca-Cabana EO; Mohsin SN; Chilla SP; Bokhari SFH,Cureus,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38143595/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38019262,Resistance exercise protects mice from protein-induced fat accretion.,"Low-protein (LP) diets extend the lifespan of diverse species and are associated with improved metabolic health in both rodents and humans. Paradoxically, many athletes and bodybuilders consume high-protein (HP) diets and protein supplements, yet are both fit and metabolically healthy. Here, we examine this paradox using weight pulling, a validated progressive resistance exercise training regimen, in mice fed either an LP diet or an isocaloric HP diet. We find that despite having lower food consumption than the LP group, HP-fed mice gain significantly more fat mass than LP-fed mice when not exercising, while weight pulling protected HP-fed mice from this excess fat accretion. The HP diet augmented exercise-induced hypertrophy of the forearm flexor complex, and weight pulling ability increased more rapidly in the exercised HP-fed mice. Surprisingly, exercise did not protect from HP-induced changes in glycemic control. Our results confirm that HP diets can augment muscle hypertrophy and accelerate strength gain induced by resistance exercise without negative effects on fat mass, and also demonstrate that LP diets may be advantageous in the sedentary. Our results highlight the need to consider both dietary composition and activity, not simply calories, when taking a precision nutrition approach to health.",Trautman ME; Braucher LN; Elliehausen C; Zhu WG; Zelenovskiy E; Green M; Sonsalla MM; Yeh CY; Hornberger TA; Konopka AR; Lamming DW,eLife,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38019262/,0,0,0,0,0,0
37851444,"An Energy-Reduced Mediterranean Diet, Physical Activity, and Body Composition: An Interim Subgroup Analysis of the PREDIMED-Plus Randomized Clinical Trial.","Strategies targeting body composition may help prevent chronic diseases in persons with excess weight, but randomized clinical trials evaluating lifestyle interventions have rarely reported effects on directly quantified body composition. To evaluate the effects of a lifestyle weight-loss intervention on changes in overall and regional body composition. The ongoing Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea-Plus (PREDIMED-Plus) randomized clinical trial is designed to test the effect of the intervention on cardiovascular disease prevention after 8 years of follow-up. The trial is being conducted in 23 Spanish research centers and includes men and women (age 55-75 years) with body mass index between 27 and 40 and metabolic syndrome. The trial reported herein is an interim subgroup analysis of the intermediate outcome body composition after 3-year follow-up, and data analysis was conducted from February 1 to November 30, 2022. Of 6874 total PREDIMED-Plus participants, a subsample of 1521 individuals, coming from centers with access to a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry device, underwent body composition measurements at 3 time points. Participants were randomly allocated to a multifactorial intervention based on an energy-reduced Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) and increased physical activity (PA) or to a control group based on usual care, with advice to follow an ad libitum MedDiet, but no physical activity promotion. The outcomes (continuous) were 3-year changes in total fat and lean mass (expressed as percentages of body mass) and visceral fat (in grams), tested using multivariable linear mixed-effects models. Clinical relevance of changes in body components (dichotomous) was assessed based on 5% or more improvements in baseline values, using logistic regression. Main analyses were performed in the evaluable population (completers only) and in sensitivity analyses, multiple imputation was performed to include data of participants lost to follow-up (intention-to-treat analyses). A total of 1521 individuals were included (mean [SD] age, 65.3 [5.0] years; 52.1% men). In comparison with the control group (n=761), participants in the intervention arm (n=760) showed greater reductions in the percentage of total fat (between group differences after 1-year, -0.94% [95% CI, -1.19 to -0.69]; 3 years, -0.38% [95% CI, -0.64 to -0.12] and visceral fat storage after 1 year, -126 g [95% CI, -179 to -73.3 g]; 3 years, -70.4 g [95% CI, -126 to -15.2 g] and greater increases in the percentage of total lean mass at 1 year, 0.88% [95% CI, 0.63%-1.12%]; 3-years 0.34% [95% CI, 0.09%-0.60%]). The intervention group was more likely to show improvements of 5% or more in baseline body components (absolute risk reduction after 1 year, 13% for total fat mass, 11% for total lean mass, and 14% for visceral fat mass; after 3-years: 6% for total fat mass, 6% for total lean mass, and 8% for visceral fat mass). The number of participants needed to treat was between 12 and 17 to attain at least 1 individual with possibly clinically meaningful improvements in body composition. The findings of this trial suggest a weight-loss lifestyle intervention based on an energy-reduced MedDiet and physical activity significantly reduced total and visceral fat and attenuated age-related losses of lean mass in older adults with overweight or obesity and metabolic syndrome.

To evaluate the association between changes in PA and changes in cognitive function in a cohort of adults with metabolic syndrome. Longitudinal observational study including 5,500 adults (mean age 65 years, SD = 5; women = 49.3% ) with metabolic syndrome. Participants underwent physical activity measurements and cognitive evaluation at baseline and at two-years of follow-up. PA was quantified using the Minnesota questionnaire-shortened version. Cognitive function was evaluated using a battery of tests: Mini-Mental Test Examination, Clock Drawing Test, Trail Making Test A and B, Verbal Fluency Test, and Digit Span. The primary outcome was two-year change in cognition, measured through the Global Composite Score (GCS) of all neuropsychological tests. Multivariable-adjusted linear regression models were fitted with baseline PA and their changes as the main exposures and changes in cognitive function as the outcome. No significant association was found between PA levels (or their changes) in the GCS of cognitive function.

No significant association was found for other neuropsychological test.

37599689,Predicting weight loss success on a new Nordic diet: an untargeted multi-platform metabolomics and machine learning approach.,"Results from randomized controlled trials indicate that no single diet performs better than other for all people living with obesity. Regardless of the diet plan, there is always large inter-individual variability in weight changes, with some individuals losing weight and some not losing or even gaining weight. This raises the possibility that, for different individuals, the optimal diet for successful weight loss may differ. The current study utilized machine learning to build a predictive model for successful weight loss in subjects with overweight or obesity on a New Nordic Diet (NND). Ninety-one subjects consumed an NND <i>ad libitum</i> for 26 weeks. Based on their weight loss, individuals were classified as responders (weight loss ≥5%, <i>n</i> = 46) or non-responders (weight loss <2%, <i>n</i> = 24). We used clinical baseline data combined with baseline urine and plasma untargeted metabolomics data from two different analytical platforms, resulting in a data set including 2,766 features, and employed symbolic regression (QLattice) to develop a predictive model for weight loss success. There were no differences in clinical parameters at baseline between responders and non-responders, except age (47 ± 13 vs. 39 ± 11 years, respectively, <i>p</i> = 0.009). The final predictive model for weight loss contained adipic acid and argininic acid from urine (both metabolites were found at lower levels in responders) and generalized from the training (AUC 0.88) to the test set (AUC 0.81). Responders were also able to maintain a weight loss of 4.3% in a 12 month follow-up period. We identified a model containing two metabolites that were able to predict the likelihood of achieving a clinically significant weight loss on an <i>ad libitum</i> NND. This work demonstrates that models based on an untargeted multi-platform metabolomics approach can be used to optimize precision dietary treatment for obesity.",Pigsborg K; Stentoft-Larsen V; Demharter S; Aldubayan MA; Trimigno A; Khakimov B; Engelsen SB; Astrup A; Hjorth MF; Dragsted LO; Magkos F,Frontiers in nutrition,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37599689/,0,0,0,0,0,1
37558243,Temporal patterns in taste sensitivity.,"Individuals vary in their ability to taste, and some individuals are more sensitive to certain tastes than others. Taste sensitivity is a predictor of various factors, such as diet, eating behavior, appetite regulation, and overall health. Furthermore, taste sensitivity can fluctuate within an individual over short to long periods of time: for example, in daily (diurnal) cycles, monthly (menstrual) cycles (in females), and yearly (seasonal) cycles. Understanding these temporal patterns is important for understanding individual eating habits and food preferences, particularly in the context of personalized and precision nutrition. This review provides a summary of the literature on taste sensitivity patterns across 3 temporal dimensions: daily, monthly, and yearly. Good evidence for diurnal patterns has been observed for sweet taste and fat taste, although the evidence is limited to rodent studies for the latter. Obese populations showed limited variation to sweet and fat taste sensitivities over a day, with limited variation in sweet taste sensitivity being linked to insulin resistance. There were mixed observations of temporal variation in sensitivity to sour and umami tastes, and there were no patterns in sensitivity to bitter taste. Menstrual patterns in sweet taste sensitivity were consistent with patterns in food intake. Other taste modality investigations had mixed findings that had little agreement across studies. Hormonal changes in females influence taste sensitivity to some degree, although the overall patterns are unclear. Seasonal patterns have been less well studied, but there is weak evidence that sweet, salty, and bitter taste sensitivities change across seasons. Differences in seasonal taste patterns have been observed in subgroups susceptible to mental health disorders, requiring further investigation. Patterns of taste sensitivity are evident across multiple temporal dimensions, and more research is needed to determine the influence of these patterns on food intake. Dysregulation of these patterns may also be a marker of certain diseases or health conditions, warranting further investigation. Notably, the alimentary tastes (umami, fat, and carbohydrate) are underrepresented in this research area and require additional investigation.",Costanzo A,Nutrition reviews,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37558243/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37458175,"Nutrition strategies to counteract sarcopenia: a focus on protein, LC <i>n</i>-3 PUFA and precision nutrition.","Diminished skeletal muscle strength and size, termed sarcopenia, contributes substantially to physical disability, falls, dependence and reduced quality of life among older people. Physical activity and nutrition are the cornerstones of sarcopenia prevention and treatment. The optimal daily protein intake required to preserve muscle mass and function among older adults is a topic of intense scientific debate. Older adults require protein intakes about 67 % higher than their younger counterparts to maximally stimulate postprandial muscle protein synthesis rates. In addition, evidence suggests a possible benefit of increasing protein intake above the population reference intake (0⋅83 g/kg/d) on lean mass and, when combined with exercise training, muscle strength. In addition to protein quantity, protein quality, the pattern of protein intake over the day and specific amino acids (i.e. leucine) represent key considerations. Long-chain <i>n</i>-3 PUFA (LC <i>n-</i>3 PUFA) supplementation has been shown to enhance muscle protein synthesis rates, increase muscle mass and function and augment adaptations to resistance training in older adults. Yet, these effects are not consistent across all studies. Emerging evidence indicates that an older person's dietary, phenotypic and behavioural characteristics may modulate the efficacy of protein and LC <i>n</i>-3 PUFA interventions for promoting improvements in muscle mass and function, highlighting the potential inadequacy of a 'one-size-fits-all' approach.

37432488,Effect of High Fat Diet on Disease Development of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and Lifestyle Intervention Strategies.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent endocrine and metabolic disorder that affects premenopausal women. The etiology of PCOS is multifaceted, involving various genetic and epigenetic factors, hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian dysfunction, androgen excess, insulin resistance, and adipose-related mechanisms. High-fat diets (HFDs) has been linked to the development of metabolic disorders and weight gain, exacerbating obesity and impairing the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. This results in increased insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and the release of inflammatory adipokines, leading to heightened fat synthesis and reduced fat breakdown, thereby worsening the metabolic and reproductive consequences of PCOS. Effective management of PCOS requires lifestyle interventions such as dietary modifications, weight loss, physical activity, and psychological well-being, as well as medical or surgical interventions in some cases. This article systematically examines the pathological basis of PCOS and the influence of HFDs on its development, with the aim of raising awareness of the connection between diet and reproductive health, providing a robust approach to lifestyle interventions, and serving as a reference for the development of targeted drug treatments.",Han Y; Wu H; Sun S; Zhao R; Deng Y; Zeng S; Chen J,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37432488/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37420008,"Associations of obesity phenotypes with weight change, cardiometabolic benefits, and type 2 diabetes incidence during a lifestyle intervention: results from the PREVIEW study.","Some individuals with overweight/obesity may be relatively metabolically healthy (MHO) and have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease than those with metabolically unhealthy overweight/obesity (MUO). We aimed to compare changes in body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors and type 2 diabetes incidence during a lifestyle intervention between individuals with MHO vs MUO. This post-hoc analysis included 1012 participants with MHO and 1153 participants with MUO at baseline in the randomized trial PREVIEW. Participants underwent an eight-week low-energy diet phase followed by a 148-week lifestyle-based weight-maintenance intervention. Adjusted linear mixed models and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used. There were no statistically significant differences in weight loss (%) between participants with MHO vs MUO over 156 weeks. At the end of the study, weight loss was 2.7% (95% CI, 1.7%-3.6%) in participants with MHO and 3.0% (2.1%-4.0%) in those with MUO. After the low-energy diet phase, participants with MHO had smaller decreases in triglyceride (mean difference between MHO vs MUO 0.08 mmol·L<sup>-1</sup> [95% CI, 0.04-0.12]; P < 0.001) but similar reductions in fasting glucose and HOMA-IR than those with MUO. However, at the end of weight maintenance, those with MHO had greater reductions in triglyceride (mean difference -0.08 mmol·L<sup>-1</sup> [-0.12--0.04]; P < 0.001), fasting glucose, 2-hour glucose (difference -0.28 mmol·L<sup>-1</sup> [-0.41--0.16]; P < 0.001), and HOMA-IR than those with MUO. Participants with MHO had smaller decreases in diastolic blood pressure and HbA<sub>1c</sub> and greater decreases in HDL cholesterol after weight loss than those with MUO, whereas the statistically significant differences disappeared at the end of weight maintenance. Participants with MHO had lower 3-year type 2 diabetes incidence than those with MUO (adjusted hazard ratio 0.37 [0.20-0.66]; P < 0.001). Individuals with MUO had greater improvements in some cardiometabolic risk factors during the low-energy diet phase, but had smaller improvements during long-term lifestyle intervention than those with MHO.",Zhu R; Huttunen-Lenz M; Stratton G; Handjieva-Darlenska T; Handjiev S; Sundvall J; Silvestre MP; Jalo E; Pietiläinen KH; Adam TC; Drummen M; Simpson EJ; Taylor MA; Poppitt SD; Navas-Carretero S; Martinez JA; Schlicht W; Fogelholm M; Brand-Miller J; Raben A,International journal of obesity (2005),2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37420008/,0,0,0,0,1,0
37335395,Behavioral and Psychological Factors Affecting Weight Loss Success.,"There is a large variability between individuals in the weight loss response to any given diet treatment, which fuels interest into personalized or precision nutrition. Although most efforts are directed toward identifying biological or metabolic factors, several behavioral and psychological factors can also be responsible for some of this interindividual variability. There are many factors that can influence the response to dietary weight loss interventions, including factors related to eating behavior (emotional eating, disinhibition, restraint, perceived stress), behaviors and societal norms related to age and sex, psychological and personal factors (motivation, self-efficacy, locus of control, self-concept), and major life events. The success of a weight loss intervention can be influenced by many psychological and behavioral constructs and not merely by physiological factors such as biology and genetics. These factors are difficult to capture accurately and are often overlooked. Future weight loss studies should consider assessing such factors to better understand the underlying reasons for the large interindividual variability to weight loss therapy.",Pigsborg K; Kalea AZ; De Dominicis S; Magkos F,Current obesity reports,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37335395/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37334485,Cultural adaptations and tailoring of public health nutrition interventions in Indigenous peoples and ethnic minority groups: opportunities for personalised and precision nutrition.,"Indigenous peoples and ethnic minority groups often experience poor diet quality and poor health outcomes. Such inequities may be partially due to nutrition interventions not meeting the unique cultural and linguistic needs of these population groups, which could be achieved using co-creation and/or personalised approaches. Cultural adaptation or tailoring of nutrition interventions has shown promise in improving some aspects of dietary intake, but this requires careful consideration to ensure it does not inadvertently exacerbate dietary inequities. The aim of this narrative review was to examine examples of cultural adaptations and/or tailoring of public health nutrition interventions that improved the dietary intake and to consider implications for the optimal design and implementation of personalised and precision nutrition interventions. This review identified six examples of cultural adaptation and/or tailoring of public health nutrition intervention in Indigenous peoples and ethnic minority groups across Australia, Canada and the US. All studies used deep socio-cultural adaptations, such as the use of Indigenous storytelling, and many included surface-level adaptations, such as the use of culturally appropriate imagery in intervention materials. However, it was not possible to attribute any improvements in dietary intake to cultural adaptation and/or tailoring <i>per se</i>, and the minimal reporting on the nature of adaptations limited our ability to determine whether the interventions used true co-creation to design content or were adapted from existing interventions. Findings from this review outline opportunities for personalised nutrition interventions to use co-creation practices to design, deliver and implement interventions in collaboration with Indigenous and ethnic minority groups.",Livingstone KM; Love P; Mathers JC; Kirkpatrick SI; Olstad DL,The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37334485/,1,0,0,0,0,0

To determine the genotype and dose of blueberries that are effective in ameliorating age-related bone loss, a multi-institutional team of investigators performed in vitro, preclinical, and clinical studies on blueberry varieties that differed in flavonoid profiles. Principal component analysis was used to select blueberry genotypes that varied in anthocyanin profiles. Total phenolic content did not predict the bioavailability of polyphenolic compounds in rats. A range in bioavailability was observed in individual polyphenolic compounds across genotypes. Both alpha and beta diversity analyses indicated that gut microbiome profiles varied with blueberry dose in rats. Additionally, the identification of specific taxa, such as Prevotellaceae_UCG-001 and Coriobacteriales, increasing after blueberry consumption adds to the mounting evidence of their role in polyphenol metabolism.

37181156,Supplementation with inulin-type fructans affects gut microbiota and attenuates some of the cardiometabolic benefits of a plant-based diet in individuals with overweight or obesity.,"The gut microbiota has emerged as a potential therapeutic target to improve the management of obesity and its comorbidities. We investigated the impact of a high fiber (∼38 g/d) plant-based diet, consumed <i>ad libitum</i>, with or without added inulin-type fructans (ITF), on the gut microbiota composition and cardiometabolic outcomes in subjects with obesity. We also tested if baseline <i>Prevotella/Bacteroides</i> (P/B) ratio predicts weight loss outcomes. This is a secondary exploratory analysis from the PREVENTOMICS study, in which 100 subjects (82 completers) aged 18-65 years with body mass index 27-40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were randomized to 10 weeks of double-blinded treatment with a personalized or a generic plant-based diet. Changes from baseline to end-of-trial in gut microbiota composition (16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing), body composition, cardiometabolic health and inflammatory markers were evaluated in the whole cohort (<i>n</i> = 82), and also compared in the subgroup of subjects who were supplemented with an additional 20 g/d ITF-prebiotics (<i>n</i> = 21) or their controls (<i>n</i> = 22). In response to the plant-based diet, all subjects lost weight (-3.2 [95% CI -3.9, -2.5] kg) and experienced significant improvements in body composition and cardiometabolic health indices. Addition of ITF to the plant-based diet reduced microbial diversity (Shannon index) and selectively increased <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and <i>Faecalibacterium</i> (<i>q</i> < 0.05). The change in the latter was significantly associated with higher values of insulin and HOMA-IR and lower HDL cholesterol. In addition, the LDL:HDL ratio and the concentrations of IL-10, MCP-1 and TNFα were significantly elevated in the ITF-subgroup. There was no relationship between baseline P/B ratio and changes in body weight (<i>r</i> = -0.07, <i>p</i> = 0.53). A plant-based diet consumed <i>ad libitum</i> modestly decreases body weight and has multiple health benefits in individuals with obesity. Addition of ITF-prebiotics on top this naturally fiber-rich background selectively changes gut microbiota composition and attenuates some of the realized cardiometabolic benefits.

37105011,Translation of nutrigenomic research for personalised and precision nutrition for cancer prevention and for cancer survivors.,"Personalised and precision nutrition uses information on individual characteristics and responses to nutrients, foods and dietary patterns to develop targeted nutritional advice that is more effective in improving the diet and health of each individual. Moving away from the conventional 'one size fits all', such targeted intervention approaches may pave the way to better population health, including lower burden of non-communicable diseases. To date, most personalised and precision nutrition approaches have been focussed on tackling obesity and cardiometabolic diseases with limited efforts directed to cancer prevention and for cancer survivors. Advances in understanding the biological basis of cancer and of the role played by diet in cancer prevention and in survival after cancer diagnosis, mean that it is timely to test and to apply such personalised and precision nutrition approaches in the cancer area. This endeavour can take advantage of the enhanced understanding of interactions between dietary factors, individual genotype and the gut microbiome that impact on risk of, and survival after, cancer diagnosis. Translation of these basic research into public health action should include real-time acquisition of nutrigenomic and related data and use of AI-based data integration methods in systems approaches that can be scaled up using mobile devices.",Malcomson FC; Mathers JC,Redox biology,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37105011/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36660409,Using nutrigenomics to guide personalized nutrition supplementation for bolstering immune system.,"Immunity refers to the ability of the human immune system to resist pathogen infection. Immune system has the basic functions of immune defense, immune self stabilization and immune surveillance. Balanced nutrition is the cornerstone of the immune system to play its immune function, and nutritional intervention is also an important means to maintain and improve immunity. Previous studies have confirmed that T cells have individual differences in recognizing viral antigens of virus infected cells, and the body's response to antigens is controlled by a variety of genetic genes, such as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, immune response (Ir) genes, etc. In this paper, through immunity genetic testing, we screen out genetically susceptible people with low immunity and people with the risk of nutrient metabolism disorders; through using lifestyle questionnaire and physical examination results, we analyze people's physical condition, dietary habits, and exercise habits to evaluate people's nutrient deficiency degree. Then, combining multi-dimensional health data, we evaluate users' immune status and nutritional deficiency risk comprehensively, further, we implemented personalized nutrition intervention on the types and doses of nutritional supplements to improve immunity. We also validated the effectiveness of our personalized nutrition solution through a population-based cohort study.",Yang J,Health information science and systems,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36660409/,0,0,0,0,0,0

In this proof-of-concept study, we investigated the effect of modulating dietary macronutrient composition according to muscle insulin-resistant (MIR) or liver insulin-resistant (LIR) phenotypes on cardiometabolic health. Women and men with MIR or LIR (n = 242, body mass index [BMI] 25-40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 40-75 years) were randomized to phenotype diet (PhenoDiet) group A or B and followed a 12-week high-monounsaturated fatty acid (HMUFA) diet or low-fat, high-protein, and high-fiber diet (LFHP) (PhenoDiet group A, MIR/HMUFA and LIR/LFHP; PhenoDiet group B, MIR/LFHP and LIR/HMUFA). PhenoDiet group B showed no significant improvements in the primary outcome disposition index, but greater improvements in insulin sensitivity, glucose homeostasis, serum triacylglycerol, and C-reactive protein compared with PhenoDiet group A were observed. We demonstrate that modulating macronutrient composition within the dietary guidelines based on tissue-specific insulin resistance (IR) phenotype enhances cardiometabolic health improvements.

36405402,Policy implementation and priorities to create healthy food environments using the Healthy Food Environment Policy Index (Food-EPI): A pooled level analysis across eleven European countries.,"Food environments have been recognised as highly influential on population diets. Government policies have great potential to create healthy food environments to promote healthy diets. This study aimed to evaluate food environment policy implementation in European countries and identify priority actions for governments to create healthy food environments. The Healthy Food Environment Policy Index (Food-EPI) was used to evaluate the level of food environment policy and infrastructure support implementation in Estonia, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, and Spain in 2019-2021. Evidence of implementation of food environment policies was compiled in each country and validated by government officials. National experts evaluated the implementation of policies and identified priority recommendations. Finland had the highest proportion (32%, <i>n</i> = 7/22) of policies shaping food environments with a ""high"" level of implementation. Slovenia and Poland had the highest proportion of policies rated at very low implementation (42%, <i>n</i> = 10/24 and 36%, <i>n</i> = 9/25 respectively). Policies regarding food provision, promotion, retail, funding, monitoring, and health in all policies were identified as the most important gaps across the European countries. Experts recommended immediate action on setting standards for nutrients of concern in processed foods, improvement of school food environments, fruit and vegetable subsidies, unhealthy food and beverage taxation, and restrictions on unhealthy food marketing to children. Immediate implementation of policies and infrastructure support that prioritize action towards healthy food environments is urgently required to tackle the burden of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases in Europe.

36369942,Sialic acid and food allergies: The link between nutrition and immunology.,"Food allergies (FA), a major public health problem recognized by the World Health Organization, affect an estimated 3%-10% of adults and 8% of children worldwide. However, effective treatments for FA are still lacking. Recent advances in glycoimmunology have demonstrated the great potential of sialic acids (SAs) in the treatment of FA. SAs are a group of nine-carbon α-ketoacids usually linked to glycoproteins and glycolipids as terminal glycans. They play an essential role in modulating immune responses and may be an effective target for FA intervention. As exogenous food components, sialylated polysaccharides have anti-FA effects. In contrast, as endogenous components, SAs on immunoglobulin E and immune cell surfaces contribute to the pathogenesis of FA. Given the lack of comprehensive information on the effects of SAs on FA, we reviewed the roles of endogenous and exogenous SAs in the pathogenesis and treatment of FA. In addition, we considered the structure-function relationship of SAs to provide a theoretical basis for the development of SA-based FA treatments.",Liu G; Hao M; Zeng B; Liu M; Wang J; Sun S; Liu C; Huilian C,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36369942/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36335092,Perceived stress as a predictor of eating behavior during the 3-year PREVIEW lifestyle intervention.,"To better support participants to achieve long-lasting results within interventions aiming for weight loss and maintenance, more information is needed about the maintenance of behavioral changes. Therefore, we examined whether perceived stress predicts the maintenance of changes in eating behavior (flexible and rigid restraint of eating, disinhibition, and hunger). The present study was a secondary analysis of the PREVIEW intervention including participants with overweight (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) at baseline and high risk of type 2 diabetes (n = 1311). Intervention included a 2-month low-energy diet phase and a 34-month subsequent weight maintenance phase. The first 6 months were considered an active behavior change stage and the remaining 2.5 years were considered a behavior maintenance stage. Eating behavior was measured using the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire and stress using the Perceived Stress Scale. The associations between stress and eating behavior were analyzed using linear mixed effects models for repeated measurements. Perceived stress measured after the active behavior change stage (at 6 months) did not predict changes in eating behavior during the behavior maintenance stage. However, frequent high stress during this period was associated with greater lapse of improved flexible restraint (p = 0.026). The mean (SD) change in flexible restraint from 6 to 36 months was -1.1 (2.1) in participants with frequent stress and -0.7 (1.8) in participants without frequent stress (Cohen's d<sub>s</sub> (95% CI) = 0.24 (0.04-0.43)). Higher perceived stress at 6 months was associated with less flexible restraint and more disinhibition and hunger throughout the behavior maintenance stage (all p < 0.001). Perceived stress was associated with features of eating behavior that may impair successful weight loss maintenance. Future interventions should investigate, whether incorporating stress reduction techniques results in more effective treatment, particularly for participants experiencing a high stress level.",Jalo E; Konttinen H; Westerterp-Plantenga M; Adam T; Drummen M; Huttunen-Lenz M; Siig Vestentoft P; Martinez JA; Handjiev S; Macdonald I; Brand-Miller J; Poppitt S; Swindell N; Lam T; Navas-Carretero S; Handjieva-Darlenska T; Taylor M; Muirhead R; Silvestre MP; Raben A; Fogelholm M,Nutrition & diabetes,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36335092/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36294858,Should Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) Be Considered an Umbrella Disorder for Mental Illness and Associated Genetic and Epigenetic Induced Dysregulation of Brain Reward Circuitry?,"Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) is defined as a breakdown of reward neurotransmission that results in a wide range of addictive, compulsive, and impulsive behaviors. RDS is caused by a combination of environmental (epigenetic) influences and DNA-based (genetic) neurotransmission deficits that interfere with the normal satisfaction of human physiological drives (i.e., food, water, and sex). An essential feature of RDS is the lack of integration between perception, cognition, and emotions that occurs because of (1) significant dopaminergic surges in motivation, reward, and learning centers causing neuroplasticity in the striato-thalamic-frontal cortical loop; (2) hypo-functionality of the excitatory glutamatergic afferents from the amygdala-hippocampus complex. A large volume of literature regarding the known neurogenetic and psychological underpinnings of RDS has revealed a significant risk of dopaminergic gene polymorphic allele overlap between cohorts of depression and subsets of schizophrenia. The suggestion is that instead of alcohol, opioids, gambling disorders, etc. being endophenotypes, the true phenotype is RDS. Additionally, reward deficiency can result from depleted or hereditary hypodopaminergia, which can manifest as a variety of personality traits and mental/medical disorders that have been linked to genetic studies with dopamine-depleting alleles. The carrying of known DNA antecedents, including epigenetic insults, results in a life-long vulnerability to RDS conditions and addictive behaviors. Epigenetic repair of hypodopaminergia, the causative basis of addictive behaviors, may involve precision DNA-guided therapy achieved by combining the Genetic Addiction Risk Severity (GARS) test with a researched neutraceutical having a number of variant names, including KB220Z. This nutraceutical formulation with pro-dopamine regulatory capabilities has been studied and published in peer-reviewed journals, mostly from our laboratory. Finally, it is our opinion that RDS should be given an ICD code and deserves to be included in the DSM-VI because while the DSM features symptomology, it is equally important to feature etiological roots as portrayed in the RDS model.",Blum K; Dennen CA; Elman I; Bowirrat A; Thanos PK; Badgaiyan RD; Downs BW; Bagchi D; Baron D; Braverman ER; Gupta A; Green R; McLaughlin T; Barh D; Gold MS,Journal of personalized medicine,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36294858/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36261843,Dietary protein and the glycemic index handle insulin resistance within a nutritional program for avoiding weight regain after energy-restricted induced weight loss.,"The role of dietary protein and glycemic index on insulin resistance (based on TyG index) within a nutritional program for weight loss and weight maintenance was examined. This study analyzed 744 adults with overweight/obesity within the DIOGenes project. Patients who lost at least 8% of their initial weight (0-8 weeks) after a low-calorie diet (LCD) were randomly assigned to one of five ad libitum diets designed for weight maintenance (8-34 weeks): high/low protein (HP/LP) and high/low glycemic index (HGI/LGI), plus a control. The complete nutritional program (0-34 weeks) included both LCD plus the randomized diets intervention. The TyG index was tested as marker of body mass composition and insulin resistance. In comparison with the LP/HGI diet, the HP/LGI diet induced a greater BMI loss (p < 0.05). ∆TyG was positively associated with resistance to BMI loss (β = 0.343, p = 0.042) during the weight maintenance stage. In patients who followed the HP/LGI diet, TyG (after LCD) correlated with greater BMI loss in the 8-34 weeks period (r = -0.256; p < 0.05) and during the 0-34 weeks intervention (r = -0.222, p < 0.05) periods. ΔTyG<sub>1</sub> value was associated with ΔBMI<sub>2</sub> (β = 0.932; p = 0.045) concerning the HP/LGI diet.

36055772,Research gaps and opportunities in precision nutrition: an NIH workshop report.,"Precision nutrition is an emerging concept that aims to develop nutrition recommendations tailored to different people's circumstances and biological characteristics. Responses to dietary change and the resulting health outcomes from consuming different diets may vary significantly between people based on interactions between their genetic backgrounds, physiology, microbiome, underlying health status, behaviors, social influences, and environmental exposures. On 11-12 January 2021, the National Institutes of Health convened a workshop entitled ""Precision Nutrition: Research Gaps and Opportunities"" to bring together experts to discuss the issues involved in better understanding and addressing precision nutrition. The workshop proceeded in 3 parts: part I covered many aspects of genetics and physiology that mediate the links between nutrient intake and health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer disease, and cancer; part II reviewed potential contributors to interindividual variability in dietary exposures and responses such as baseline nutritional status, circadian rhythm/sleep, environmental exposures, sensory properties of food, stress, inflammation, and the social determinants of health; part III presented the need for systems approaches, with new methods and technologies that can facilitate the study and implementation of precision nutrition, and workforce development needed to create a new generation of researchers. The workshop concluded that much research will be needed before more precise nutrition recommendations can be achieved. This includes better understanding and accounting for variables such as age, sex, ethnicity, medical history, genetics, and social and environmental factors. The advent of new methods and technologies and the availability of considerably more data bring tremendous opportunity.

35839545,"A double-blinded, randomized, parallel intervention to evaluate biomarker-based nutrition plans for weight loss: The PREVENTOMICS study.","Growing evidence suggests that biomarker-guided dietary interventions can optimize response to treatment. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of the PREVENTOMCIS platform-which uses metabolomic and genetic information to classify individuals into different 'metabolic clusters' and create personalized dietary plans-for improving health outcomes in subjects with overweight or obesity. A 10-week parallel, double-blinded, randomized intervention was conducted in 100 adults (82 completers) aged 18-65 years, with body mass index ≥27 but <40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, who were allocated into either a personalized diet group (n = 49) or a control diet group (n = 51). About 60% of all food was provided free-of-charge. No specific instruction to restrict energy intake was given. The primary outcome was change in fat mass from baseline, evaluated by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Other endpoints included body weight, waist circumference, lipid profile, glucose homeostasis markers, inflammatory markers, blood pressure, physical activity, stress and eating behavior. There were significant main effects of time (P < 0.01), but no group main effects, or time-by-group interactions, for the change in fat mass (personalized: -2.1 [95% CI -2.9, -1.4] kg; control: -2.0 [95% CI -2.7, -1.3] kg) and body weight (personalized: -3.1 [95% CI -4.1, -2.1] kg; control: -3.3 [95% CI -4.2, -2.4] kg). The difference between groups in fat mass change was -0.1 kg (95% CI -1.2, 0.9 kg, P = 0.77). Both diets resulted in significant improvements in insulin resistance and lipid profile, but there were no significant differences between groups. Personalized dietary plans did not result in greater benefits over a generic, but generally healthy diet, in this 10-week clinical trial. Further studies are required to establish the soundness of different precision nutrition approaches, and translate this science into clinically relevant dietary advice to reduce the burden of obesity and its comorbidities.

35776947,"Perspective: Leveraging the Gut Microbiota to Predict Personalized Responses to Dietary, Prebiotic, and Probiotic Interventions.","Humans often show variable responses to dietary, prebiotic, and probiotic interventions. Emerging evidence indicates that the gut microbiota is a key determinant for this population heterogeneity. Here, we provide an overview of some of the major computational and experimental tools being applied to critical questions of microbiota-mediated personalized nutrition and health. First, we discuss the latest advances in in silico modeling of the microbiota-nutrition-health axis, including the application of statistical, mechanistic, and hybrid artificial intelligence models. Second, we address high-throughput in vitro techniques for assessing interindividual heterogeneity, from ex vivo batch culturing of stool and continuous culturing in anaerobic bioreactors, to more sophisticated organ-on-a-chip models that integrate both host and microbial compartments. Third, we explore in vivo approaches for better understanding of personalized, microbiota-mediated responses to diet, prebiotics, and probiotics, from nonhuman animal models and human observational studies, to human feeding trials and crossover interventions. We highlight examples of existing, consumer-facing precision nutrition platforms that are currently leveraging the gut microbiota. Furthermore, we discuss how the integration of a broader set of the tools and techniques described in this piece can generate the data necessary to support a greater diversity of precision nutrition strategies. Finally, we present a vision of a precision nutrition and healthcare future, which leverages the gut microbiota to design effective, individual-specific interventions.",Gibbons SM; Gurry T; Lampe JW; Chakrabarti A; Dam V; Everard A; Goas A; Gross G; Kleerebezem M; Lane J; Maukonen J; Penna ALB; Pot B; Valdes AM; Walton G; Weiss A; Zanzer YC; Venlet NV; Miani M,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35776947/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35745100,Impact of Physical Activity Differences Due to COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown on Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Parameters in Adults with Metabolic Syndrome.,"A Mediterranean lifestyle with a Mediterranean diet and regular physical activity (PA) improves metabolic syndrome (MetS) characteristics and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The COVID-19 pandemic stopped healthy habits and increased NAFLD progression. To assess how PA differences due to COVID-19 lockdown affected NAFLD parameters in adults with MetS. Longitudinal 2-year analysis of data obtained between COVID-19 pre- and post-lockdown in a parallel-group randomized trial (n = 57, aged 40-60 years old, with MetS and NAFLD). NAFLD status and related parameters were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), blood collection analysis and related indexes. PA and fitness status were assessed by an Alpha-Fit test battery, accelerometers, validated Minnesota questionnaire and functional fitness score. During lockdown, study personnel telephoned patients to motivate them. Participants were grouped according to PA levels. The low PA group improved its fitness score tests (0.2) after lockdown more than the medium PA group, and it decreased its sedentary activity (-48.7 min/day), increased light (20.9 min/day) and moderate (32.3 min/day) PA intensities and improved sleep efficiency (0.6%) in comparison with the medium and high PA groups. The high PA group increased its steps per day more than the other groups. The low PA group was the only group that decreased its gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels (-17.0 U/L). All groups increased their fatty liver index (FLI) after lockdown, but the medium PA group increased its FLI more than the low PA group. Participants in the high PA group decreased their HDL-cholesterol levels more than participants in the medium PA group (-0.4 mg/dL). Stopping regular PA together with an unhealthy lifestyle leads to a worsening of MetS and NAFLD. COVID-19 lockdown induced a decrease in PA in more active people, but inactive people increased their PA levels. Motivation seemed to be very important during lockdown.",Mascaró CM; Bouzas C; Montemayor S; García S; Mateos D; Casares M; Gómez C; Ugarriza L; Borràs PA; Martínez JA; Tur JA,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35745100/,0,0,0,0,0,1

A Post Hoc Analysis of the PREVIEW Study.,"To examine whether the effect of a 3-year lifestyle intervention on body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors differs by prediabetes metabolic phenotype. This post hoc analysis of the multicenter, randomized trial, PREVention of diabetes through lifestyle interventions and population studies In Europe and around the World (PREVIEW), included 1,510 participants with prediabetes (BMI ≥25 kg ⋅ m-2; defined using oral glucose tolerance tests). Of these, 58% had isolated impaired fasting glucose (iIFG), 6% had isolated impaired glucose tolerance (iIGT), and 36% had IFG+IGT; 73% had normal hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c; <39 mmol ⋅ mol-1) and 25% had intermediate HbA1c (39-47 mmol ⋅ mol-1). Participants underwent an 8-week diet-induced rapid weight loss, followed by a 148-week lifestyle-based weight maintenance intervention. Linear mixed models adjusted for intervention arm and other confounders were used. In the available-case and complete-case analyses, participants with IFG+IGT had greater sustained weight loss after lifestyle intervention (adjusted mean at 156 weeks -3.5% [95% CI, -4.7%, -2.3%]) than those with iIFG (mean -2.5% [-3.6%, -1.3%]) relative to baseline (P = 0.011). Participants with IFG+IGT and iIFG had similar cardiometabolic benefits from the lifestyle intervention. The differences in cardiometabolic benefits between those with iIGT and IFG+IGT were minor or inconsistent in different analyses. Participants with normal versus intermediate HbA1c had similar weight loss over 3 years and minor differences in cardiometabolic benefits during weight loss, whereas those with normal HbA1c had greater improvements in fasting glucose, 2-h glucose (adjusted between-group difference at 156 weeks -0.54 mmol ⋅ L-1 [95% CI -0.70, -0.39], P < 0.001), and triglycerides (difference -0.07 mmol ⋅ L-1 [-0.11, -0.03], P < 0.001) during the lifestyle intervention.

35639552,Comparison of dietary and physical activity behaviors in women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 39 471 women.,"Lifestyle (dietary and/or physical activity [PA]) modification is recommended as first-line therapy to manage polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Current recommendations are based on healthy lifestyle practices for the general public since evidence for unique lifestyle approaches in PCOS is limited and low quality. We aimed to synthesize evidence on dietary and PA behaviors between women with PCOS and those without PCOS. Primary outcomes were overall diet quality, total energy intake and total PA, and secondary outcomes included macronutrients, micronutrients, food groups, foods, glycemic indices, sedentary time and sitting levels. We conducted this work to identify any unique lifestyle behaviors in women with PCOS that could underlie the propensity of weight gain and obesity in PCOS and be targeted for precision nutrition and PA interventions. These findings could be used to inform future practice recommendations and research that more effectively address complications (weight gain, obesity, diabetes, infertility, cardiovascular disease and mental health) in this high-risk population. Databases of MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus and CINAHL were searched until 15 February 2022 to identify observational studies documenting dietary and PA behaviors between women with PCOS and without PCOS (Controls). Studies on children, adolescents (&lt;18 years), pregnant or menopausal-aged women (&gt;50 years) were excluded. Data were pooled by random-effects models and expressed as (standardized) mean differences (MD) and 95% CIs. The risk of bias was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). Fifty-four studies (N = 39 471 participants; [n = 8736 PCOS; 30 735 Controls]) were eligible (96%; [52/54] NOS scores ≥ 7). Women with PCOS had higher cholesterol (MD: 12.78, 95% CI: 1.48 to 24.08 mg/day; P = 0.03; I2 = 19%), lower magnesium (MD: -21.46, 95% CI: -41.03 to -1.91 mg/day; P = 0.03; I2 = 76%), and a tendency for lower zinc (MD: -1.08, 95% CI: -2.19 to -0.03 mg/day; P = 0.05; I2 = 96%) intake, despite lower alcohol consumption (MD: -0.95, 95% CI: -1.67 to 0.22 g/day; P = 0.02; I2 = 0%) versus Controls. Also, women with PCOS had lower total PA (standardized mean difference: -0.38, 95% CI: -0.72 to 0.03; P = 0.03; I2 = 98%). Conversely, energy, macronutrients (carbohydrate, fat, protein, fiber), micronutrients (folic acid, iron, calcium, sodium), glycemic index and glycemic load were similar (all: P ≥ 0.06). Most eligible studies reported lower total adherence to healthy eating patterns or poorer consumption of major food groups (grains, fruits, vegetables, proteins, seeds, nuts, dairy) in women with PCOS, as described narratively since variable study methodology did not permit meta-analyses. Collective evidence supports that women with PCOS have a lower overall diet quality, poorer dietary intakes (higher cholesterol, lower magnesium and zinc) and lower total PA, despite lower alcohol consumption versus those without PCOS. Considerable heterogeneity among studies reinforces the need for research to address any relative contributions of other factors (e.g. genetic, metabolic or sociodemographic) to the observed differences. These clarifications may contribute to future evidence-based guideline recommendations on monitoring and managing PCOS in the era of precision lifestyle medicine.",Kazemi M; Kim JY; Wan C; Xiong JD; Michalak J; Xavier IB; Ganga K; Tay CT; Grieger JA; Parry SA; Moran LJ; Lujan ME,Human reproduction update,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35639552/,0,1,0,1,0,0

A variety of diet-focused interventions including time-restricted eating are also increasingly being promoted for weight management. This chapter reviews different types of interventions for weight management, their underlying health behavior change models, and effectiveness to date in randomized trials. The results justify increasing efforts to improve program effectiveness generally, and to personalize interventions to support long-term adherence. The high prevalence of obesity worldwide, combined with the known increase in risk of non-communicable diseases with duration of excess weight, provides a compelling justification for routine delivery of effective weight management interventions in the community and in clinical care.",Roberts SB; Anton S; Dao MC,Handbook of experimental pharmacology,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35624229/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35612976,Contribution of Biological Age-Predictive Biomarkers to Nutrition Research: A Systematic Review of the Current Evidence and Implications for Future Research and Clinical Practice.,"The global population is living longer; however, not everyone ages at the same rate with regard to their physical and cognitive abilities and their vulnerability to certain diseases and death. This review aimed to synthesize the contribution of biological age-predictive biomarkers to nutrition research and highlight the implications for future research and clinical practice. MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Cochrane CENTRAL were systematically searched on 30 September 2021 for randomized controlled trials and cross-sectional studies examining the association between nutrition and biological age in older adults reporting on genetic, clinical, or molecular biomarkers of biological aging. Cochrane's ROB 2 and ROBINS-I were used to assess the quality of included studies. Synthesis was undertaken narratively. Of 1245 records identified from the search, 13 studies from 8 countries and territories, involving 5043 participants, were included. Seven studies assessed associations between nutrient food intake and telomere attrition, reporting protective effects for branched-chain amino acids, calcium and vitamin D, and a diet of a lower inflammatory index; whereas they found shorter telomeres in people consuming more processed foods and arachidonic acid and other proinflammatory compounds. Five studies examined the associations between plasma nutrition biomarkers and cognitive function, and found a protective effect for HDL cholesterol, lycopene, carotenoids, ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids, and vitamins B, C, D, and E; whereas trans fatty acids and fibrinogen correlated with a decline in cognitive function. One study used Horvath's clock and reported the epigenetic rejuvenation effect of a Mediterranean diet. In conclusion, biological aging was negatively associated with an anti-inflammatory diet. However, a few studies did not control for the confounding effect of other lifestyle factors. Future research should address this and also assess the synergistic effect of different nutrients, their combinations, and evaluate their dose-response relations. Nutrition practice can incorporate updated screening procedures for older people that include relevant biological aging nutrition markers, leading to anti-aging precision nutrition therapy. The methodology of this systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021288122).",Siopis G; Porter J,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35612976/,0,1,0,0,0,0
35610522,Age- and sex-specific effects of a long-term lifestyle intervention on body weight and cardiometabolic health markers in adults with prediabetes: results from the diabetes prevention study PREVIEW.,"Lifestyle interventions are the first-line treatment option for body weight and cardiometabolic health management. However, whether age groups or women and men respond differently to lifestyle interventions is under debate. We aimed to examine age- and sex-specific effects of a low-energy diet (LED) followed by a long-term lifestyle intervention on body weight, body composition and cardiometabolic health markers in adults with prediabetes (i.e. impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance). This observational study used longitudinal data from 2223 overweight participants with prediabetes in the multicentre diabetes prevention study PREVIEW. The participants underwent a LED-induced rapid weight loss (WL) period followed by a 3 year lifestyle-based weight maintenance (WM) intervention. Changes in outcomes of interest in prespecified age (younger: 25-45 years; middle-aged: 46-54 years; older: 55-70 years) or sex (women and men) groups were compared. In total, 783 younger, 319 middle-aged and 1121 older adults and 1503 women and 720 men were included in the analysis. In the available case and complete case analyses, multivariable-adjusted linear mixed models showed that younger and older adults had similar weight loss after the LED, whereas older adults had greater sustained weight loss after the WM intervention (adjusted difference for older vs younger adults -1.25% [95% CI -1.92, -0.58], p<0.001). After the WM intervention, older adults lost more fat-free mass and bone mass and had smaller improvements in 2 h plasma glucose (adjusted difference for older vs younger adults 0.65 mmol/l [95% CI 0.50, 0.80], p<0.001) and systolic blood pressure (adjusted difference for older vs younger adults 2.57 mmHg [95% CI 1.37, 3.77], p<0.001) than younger adults. Older adults had smaller decreases in fasting and 2 h glucose, HbA<sub>1c</sub> and systolic blood pressure after the WM intervention than middle-aged adults. In the complete case analysis, the above-mentioned differences between middle-aged and older adults disappeared, but the direction of the effect size did not change. After the WL period, compared with men, women had less weight loss (adjusted difference for women vs men 1.78% [95% CI 1.12, 2.43], p<0.001) with greater fat-free mass and bone mass loss and smaller improvements in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, LDL-cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure. After the WM intervention, women had greater fat-free mass and bone mass loss and smaller improvements in HbA<sub>1c</sub> and LDL-cholesterol, while they had greater improvements in fasting glucose, triacylglycerol (adjusted difference for women vs men -0.08 mmol/l [-0.11, -0.04], p<0.001) and HDL-cholesterol. Older adults benefited less from a lifestyle intervention in relation to body composition and cardiometabolic health markers than younger adults, despite greater sustained weight loss. Women benefited less from a LED followed by a lifestyle intervention in relation to body weight and body composition than men. Future interventions targeting older adults or women should take prevention of fat-free mass and bone mass loss into consideration.

35602745,Reliability and Validation of the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire in 3- to 6-Year-Old Spanish Children.,"Eating behavior is often established during the first years of life. Therefore, it is important to make a research on it to understand the relationships that children have with food and how this can contribute to prevent the development of childhood obesity. An appropriate assessment of eating behavior can be achieved using the ""Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire"" (CEBQ). This questionnaire has been validated in several populations and languages, but it has never been translated, adapted, and validated for Spanish children. To evaluate the reliability and internal consistency of the CEBQ questionnaire, culturally adapted and translated into Spanish (Spain), in Spanish families with children aged 3 to 6 years, as well as its association with children's body mass index (BMI) to test its construct validity. Children between 3 and 6 years old were recruited from the ongoing MELI-POP randomized controlled clinical trial, as well as from public schools located in middle class neighborhoods of Zaragoza, Spain, to complete the sample. Sociodemographic characteristics and anthropometric measures were obtained according to standardized methods. The 35-item CEBQ questionnaire was completed twice with a time difference of 3 weeks between each response. Statistical analyses included the evaluation of internal consistency and reliability of the questionnaire, a confirmatory factor analysis, and the association between the different CEBQ scales and the children's BMI. A total of 197 children completed variables; 97 of them were boys (49.2%) and 100 girls (50.8%). Mean age of the total sample was 4.7 ± 0.9 years. There was a high test-re-test reliability of the questionnaire with values close to 1, with an average of 0.66 and a good internal consistency (Cronbach alpha with values above 0.7), so that a high reliability is established between the items in each scale. A gradual positive association was found between the score of different ""pro-intake"" scales of the CEBQ: ""Food Responsiveness,"" ""Emotional Overeating,"" and ""Enjoyment of food"" and the children's BMI; at the opposite, negative associations were observed between BMI and the score of anti-intake scales ""Satiety Responsiveness,"" ""Slowness in Eating,"" and ""Emotional Undereating.""

35565780,Effect of a Six-Month Lifestyle Intervention on the Physical Activity and Fitness Status of Adults with NAFLD and Metabolic Syndrome.,"(1) Background: Physical inactivity has been linked to NAFLD, and exercise has been reported as useful to reduce intrahepatic fat content in NAFLD. (2) Objectives: To assess the physical activity (PA) and fitness status after a six-month lifestyle intervention (diet and PA) in adults with NAFLD and metabolic syndrome (MetS). (3) Design: Prospective cohort analysis of data obtained between baseline and six-year parallel-group randomized trial (n = 155, aged 40-60 years old, with MetS and NAFLD). Participants were randomized into three nutritional and PA intervention groups: Conventional diet (CD); MedDiet-high meal frequency (MD-HMF); MedDiet-physical activity (MD-PA). (4) Methods: PA and fitness status were assessed using a validated Minnesota questionnaire, ALPHA-FIT test battery, accelerometers, and functional fitness score. Information related to age, gender, education level, marital status, socioeconomic status, smoking habit, and alcohol consumption were also obtained. (5) Results: The CD group had higher improvement in standing handgrip than the MD-HMF group. The MD-PA group did more modified push-up repetitions than the CD group. The MD-PA and CD groups showed higher sitting handgrip than the MD-HMF group. The MD-HMF group showed the highest decrease in aerobic capacity. The MD-PA group showed lower light intensity PA/day than the CD and MD-HMF groups. The MD-PA group showed higher moderate intensity PA than the CD and MD-HMF groups. The CD group reported more METs per day than the MD-HMF group.

35512761,Almond Consumption for 8 Weeks Altered Host and Microbial Metabolism in Comparison to a Control Snack in Young Adults.,"Almond consumption can improve cardiometabolic (CM) health. However, the mechanisms underlying those benefits are not well characterized. This study explored the effects of consuming a snack of almonds vs. crackers for 8 weeks on changes in metabolomic profiles in young adults (clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT03084003). Participants (n = 73, age: 18-19 years, BMI: 18-41 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were randomly assigned to consume either almonds (2 oz/d, n = 38) or an isocaloric control snack of graham crackers (325 kcal/d, n = 35) daily for 8 weeks. Blood samples were collected at baseline prior to and at 4 and 8 weeks after the intervention. Metabolite abundances in the serum were quantified by hydrophilic interaction chromatography quadrupole (Q) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS/MS), gas chromatography (GC) TOF MS, CSH-ESI (electrospray) QTOF MS/MS, and targeted analyses for free PUFAs, total fatty acids, oxylipins and endocannabinoids. Linear mixed model analyses with baseline-adjustment were conducted, and those results were used for enrichment and network analyses. Microbial community pathway predictions from 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples was done using PICRUST2. Almond consumption enriched unsaturated triglycerides, unsaturated phosphatidylcholines, saturated and unsaturated lysophosphatidylcholines, tricarboxylic acids, and tocopherol clusters (p < 0.05). Targeted analyses reveal lower levels of omega-3 total fatty acids (TFAs) overall in the almond group compared to the cracker group (p < 0.05). Microbial amino acid biosynthesis, and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism pathways were also differentially enriched at the end of the intervention (p < 0.05). The study demonstrates the differential effects of almonds on host tocopherol, lipid, and TCA cycle metabolism with potential changes in microbial metabolism, which may interact with host metabolism to facilitate the CM benefits.",Dhillon J; Newman JW; Fiehn O; Ortiz RM,Journal of the American Nutrition Association,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35512761/,0,0,0,0,1,0
35307761,"Associations between dietary patterns, FTO genotype and obesity in adults from seven European countries.","High-fat and low-fibre discretionary food intake and FTO genotype are each associated independently with higher risk of obesity. However, few studies have investigated links between obesity and dietary patterns based on discretionary food intake, and the interaction effect of FTO genotype are unknown. Thus, this study aimed to derive dietary patterns based on intake of discretionary foods, saturated fatty acids (SFA) and fibre, and examine cross-sectional associations with BMI and waist circumference (WC), and interaction effects of FTO genotype. Baseline data on 1280 adults from seven European countries were included (the Food4Me study). Dietary intake was estimated from a Food Frequency Questionnaire. Reduced rank regression was used to derive three dietary patterns using response variables of discretionary foods, SFA and fibre density. DNA was extracted from buccal swabs. Anthropometrics were self-measured. Linear regression analyses were used to examine associations between dietary patterns and BMI and WC, with an interaction for FTO genotype. Dietary pattern 1 (positively correlated with discretionary foods and SFA, and inversely correlated with fibre) was associated with higher BMI (β:0.64; 95% CI 0.44, 0.84) and WC (β:1.58; 95% CI 1.08, 2.07). There was limited evidence dietary pattern 2 (positively correlated with discretionary foods and SFA) and dietary pattern 3 (positively correlated with SFA and fibre) were associated with anthropometrics. FTO risk genotype was associated with higher BMI and WC, with no evidence of a dietary interaction.

35294009,Sex Differences Across the Life Course: A Focus On Unique Nutritional and Health Considerations among Women.,"In the United States, women, while having a longer life expectancy than men, experience a differential risk for chronic diseases and have unique nutritional needs based on physiological and hormonal changes across the life span. However, much of what is known about health is based on research conducted in men. Additional complexity in assessing nutritional needs within gender include the variations in genetics, body compositions, hormonal milieus, underlying chronic diseases, and medication usage, with this list expanding as we consider these variables across the life course. It is clear women experience nutrient shortfalls during key periods of their lives, which may differentially impact their health. Consequently, as we move into the era of precision nutrition, understanding these sex- and gender-based differences may help optimize recommendations and interventions chosen to support health and weight management. Recently, a scientific conference was convened with content experts to explore these topics from a life-course perspective at biological, physiological, and behavioral levels. This publication summarizes the presentations and discussions from the workshop and provides an overview of important nutrition and related lifestyle considerations across the life course. The landscape of addressing female-specific nutritional needs continues to grow; now more than ever, it is essential to increase our understanding of the physiological differences between men and women, and determine how these physiological considerations may aid in optimizing nutritional strategies to support certain personal goals related to health, quality of life, sleep, and exercise performance among women.",Bailey RL; Dog TL; Smith-Ryan AE; Das SK; Baker FC; Madak-Erdogan Z; Hammond BR; Sesso HD; Eapen A; Mitmesser SH; Wong A; Nguyen H,The Journal of nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35294009/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35268038,Association between Physical Activity and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Adults with Metabolic Syndrome: The FLIPAN Study.,"Background: A lifestyle with regular PA (physical activity) and Mediterranean diet has benefits on NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) and MetS (metabolic syndrome). Objectives: To assess the association between physical activity and NAFLD in adults with MetS. Design: Cross-sectional study in 155 participants (40−60 years old) from Balearic Islands and Navarra (Spain) with diagnosis of NAFLD and MetS, and BMI (body mass index) between 27 and 40 Kg/m2. Methods: PA level was categorized into two groups according to weekly METs (metabolic equivalents of tasks). PA was assessed using a validated Minnesota questionnaire and accelerometers. MetS parameters were assessed by blood collection analysis and NAFLD by abdominal MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Results: Participants with high PA showed more energy expenditure and expended more calories than ingested (−143.9 Kcal/day; p < 0.001). PA was a risk factor for AST (aspartate aminotransferase) (adjusted OR: 7.26; 95% CI: 1.79−29.40) and a protective factor for ALT (alanine aminotransferase) (adjusted OR: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.12−0.48), GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase) (adjusted OR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.29−0.94) and IFC-NMR (intrahepatic fat content by nuclear magnetic resonance) (adjusted OR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.12−0.56) when sociodemographic confounders were considered. Conclusions: NAFLD patients with high PA showed more positive relationship on MetS parameters and liver profile (ALT, GGT, IFC-NMR) than subjects with low PA, but not for AST. Difference between calories ingested and expended influenced this relationship.",Mascaró CM; Bouzas C; Montemayor S; Casares M; Gómez C; Ugarriza L; Borràs PA; Martínez JA; Tur JA,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35268038/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35265654,Genetically-Guided Medical Nutrition Therapy in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Pre-diabetes: A Series of <i>n</i>-of-1 Superiority Trials.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a heterogeneous metabolic disorder of multifactorial etiology that includes genetic and dietary influences. By addressing the latter, medical nutrition therapy (MNT) contributes to the management of T2DM or pre-diabetes toward achieving glycaemic control and improved insulin sensitivity. However, the clinical outcomes of MNT vary and may further benefit from personalized nutritional plans that take into consideration genetic variations associated with individual responses to macronutrients. The aim of the present series of <i>n</i>-of-1 trials was to assess the effects of genetically-guided vs. conventional MNT on patients with pre-diabetes or T2DM. A quasi-experimental, cross-over design was adopted in three Caucasian adult men with either diagnosis. Complete diet, bioclinical and anthropometric assessment was performed and a conventional MNT, based on the clinical practice guidelines was applied for 8 weeks. After a week of ""wash-out,"" a precision MNT was prescribed for an additional 8-week period, based on the genetic characteristics of each patient. Outcomes of interest included changes in body weight (BW), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and blood pressure (BP). Collectively, the trials indicated improvements in BW, FPG, BP, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) following the genetically-guided precision MNT intervention. Moreover, both patients with pre-diabetes experienced remission of the condition. We conclude that improved BW loss and glycemic control can be achieved in patients with pre-diabetes/T2DM, by coupling MNT to their genetic makeup, guiding optimal diet, macronutrient composition, exercise and oral nutrient supplementation in a personalized manner.",Gkouskou KK; Grammatikopoulou MG; Lazou E; Sanoudou D; Goulis DG; Eliopoulos AG,Frontiers in nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35265654/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35263691,Animal-based food choice and associations with long-term weight maintenance and metabolic health after a large and rapid weight loss: The PREVIEW study.,"Low-energy diet replacement is an effective tool to induce large and rapid weight loss and improve metabolic health, but in the long-term individuals often experience significant weight regain. Little is known about the role of animal-based foods in weight maintenance and metabolic health. We aimed to examine longitudinal associations of animal-based foods with weight maintenance and glycaemic and cardiometabolic risk factors. We also modelled replacement of processed meat with other high-protein foods. In this secondary analysis, longitudinal data were analysed from 688 adults (26-70 years) with overweight and prediabetes after 8-week low-energy diet-induced weight loss (≥8% of initial body weight) in a 3-year, multi-centre, diabetes prevention study (PREVIEW). Animal-based food consumption, including unprocessed red meat, processed red meat, poultry, dairy products, fish and seafood, and eggs, was repeatedly assessed using 4-day food records. Multi-adjusted linear mixed models and isoenergetic substitution models were used to examine the potential associations. The available-case analysis showed that each 10-g increment in processed meat, but not total meat, unprocessed red meat, poultry, dairy products, or eggs, was positively associated with weight regain (0.17 kg⋅year<sup>-1</sup>, 95% CI 0.10, 0.25, P < 0.001) and increments in waist circumference, HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and triacylglycerols. The associations of processed meat with HbA<sub>1c</sub> or triacylglycerols disappeared when adjusted for weight change. Fish and seafood consumption was inversely associated with triacylglycerols and triacylglycerol-glucose index, independent of weight change. Modelled replacement of processed meat with isoenergetic (250-300 kJ·day<sup>-1</sup> or 60-72 kcal·day<sup>-1</sup>) dairy, poultry, fish and seafood, grains, or nuts was associated with -0.59 (95% CI -0.77, -0.41), -0.66 (95% CI -0.93, -0.40), -0.58 (95% CI -0.88, -0.27), and -0.69 (95% CI -0.96, -0.41) kg·year<sup>-1</sup> of weight regain, respectively (all P < 0.001) and significant improvements in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and triacylglycerols. Higher intake of processed meat, but not total or unprocessed red meat, poultry, dairy products, or eggs may be associated with greater weight regain and more adverse glycaemic and cardiometabolic risk factors. Replacing processed meat with a wide variety of high-protein foods, including unprocessed red meat, poultry, dairy products, fish, eggs, grains, and nuts, could improve weight maintenance and metabolic health after rapid weight loss.

They are employed to address differences in treatment response and adverse events between patients, in a comparative effectiveness manner, extending beyond the delivery of horizontal recommendations for all. The n-of-1 design has been applied to deliver precision exercise interventions, through eHealth and mHealth technologies. Regarding personalized and precision medical nutrition therapy, few trials have implemented dietary manipulations and one series of n-of-1 trials has applied comprehensive genetic data to improve body weight.

35108358,A Systematic Review of Literature on the Representation of Racial and Ethnic Minority Groups in Clinical Nutrition Interventions.,"The racial and ethnic disparities in diet-related chronic diseases are major concerns. This systematic review examines the extent to which diet-induced changes in health outcomes, such as cardiometabolic, inflammation, cancer, bone health, and kidney function outcomes, etc., have been reported and discussed by race or ethnicity in randomized trials with 2 or more diet arms that recruited both minority and non-Hispanic White groups. Databases (i.e., PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) were searched up to August 2021. Thirty-four studies that discussed effects of defined dietary interventions on health outcomes by racial or ethnic minority group compared with non-Hispanic Whites were included in the systematic review (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021229256). Acute trials and those with 1 diet arm that accounted for race or ethnicity in their analyses and studies that focused on a single racial or ethnic group were discussed separately. Most studies were conducted in Black compared with White adults testing effects of energy restriction, macronutrient modification, sodium reduction, or variations of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on cardiometabolic outcomes. There was limited focus on other minority groups. Evidence suggests greater blood pressure reduction for Black adults compared with Whites particularly with DASH (or similar) diets. Overall, there was limited consideration for group-specific eating patterns and diet acceptability. Overall risk of bias was low. With emerging precision nutrition initiatives that aim to optimize metabolic responses in population subgroups through tailored approaches, it is imperative to ensure adequate representation of racial and ethnic subgroups for addressing health disparities. Factors that help explain variability in responses such as socioecological context should be included and adequately powered. Given the racial and ethnic disparities in chronic diseases, studying the adoption, maintenance, and effectiveness of dietary interventions on health outcomes among different groups is critical for developing approaches that can mitigate diet-related health disparities.",Dhillon J; Jacobs AG; Ortiz S; Diaz Rios LK,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35108358/,0,1,0,0,0,0
35025088,Metabotyping for Precision Nutrition and Weight Management: Hype or Hope?,"Precision nutrition requires a solid understanding of the factors that determine individual responses to dietary treatment. We review the current state of knowledge in identifying human metabotypes - based on circulating biomarkers - that can predict weight loss or other relevant physiological outcomes in response to diet treatment. Not many studies have been conducted in this area and the ones identified here are heterogeneous in design and methodology, and therefore difficult to synthesize and draw conclusions. The basis of the creation of metabotypes varies widely, from using thresholds for a single metabolite to using complex algorithms to generate multi-component constructs that include metabolite and genetic information. Furthermore, available studies are a mix of hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating studies, and most of them lack experimental testing in human trials. Although this field of research is still in its infancy, precision-based dietary intervention strategies focusing on the metabotype group level hold promise for designing more effective dietary treatments for obesity.",Pigsborg K; Magkos F,Current nutrition reports,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35025088/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34970584,"Multiomics Approach to Precision Sports Nutrition: Limits, Challenges, and Possibilities.","Most sports nutrition guidelines are based on group average responses and professional opinion. Precision nutrition for athletes aims to improve the individualization of nutrition practices to optimize long-term performance and health. This is a 2-step process that first involves the acquisition of individual-specific, science-based information using a variety of sources including lifestyle and medical histories, dietary assessment, physiological assessments from the performance lab and wearable sensors, and multiomics data from blood, urine, saliva, and stool samples. The second step consists of the delivery of science-based nutrition advice, behavior change support, and the monitoring of health and performance efficacy and benefits relative to cost. Individuals vary widely in the way they respond to exercise and nutritional interventions, and understanding why this metabolic heterogeneity exists is critical for further advances in precision nutrition. Another major challenge is the development of evidence-based individualized nutrition recommendations that are embraced and efficacious for athletes seeking the most effective enhancement of performance, metabolic recovery, and health. At this time precision sports nutrition is an emerging discipline that will require continued technological and scientific advances before this approach becomes accurate and practical for athletes and fitness enthusiasts at the small group or individual level.

34915273,Associations of quantity and quality of carbohydrate sources with subjective appetite sensations during 3-year weight-loss maintenance: Results from the PREVIEW intervention study.,"The association of quantity and quality of carbohydrate sources with appetite during long-term weight-loss maintenance (WLM) after intentional weight loss (WL) is unclear. We aimed to investigate longitudinal associations of quantity and quality of carbohydrate sources with changes in subjective appetite sensations during WLM. This secondary analysis evaluated longitudinal data from the 3-year WLM phase of the PREVIEW study, a 2 × 2 factorial (diet-physical activity arms), multi-center, randomized trial. 1279 individuals with overweight or obesity and prediabetes (25-70 years; BMI≥25 kg m<sup>-2</sup>) were included. Individuals were merged into 1 group to assess longitudinal associations of yearly changes in appetite sensations. Quantity and quality of carbohydrate sources including total carbohydrate, glycemic index (GI), glycemic load (GL), and total dietary fiber were assessed via 4-day food diaries at 4 timepoints (26, 52, 104, and 156 weeks) during WLM. Visual analog scales were used to assess appetite sensations in the previous week. During WLM, participants consumed on average 160.6 (25th, 75th percentiles 131.1, 195.8) g·day<sup>-1</sup> of total carbohydrate, with GI 53.8 (48.7, 58.8) and GL 85.3 (67.2, 108.9) g day<sup>-1</sup>, and 22.3 (17.6, 27.3) g·day<sup>-1</sup> of dietary fiber. In the available-case analysis, multivariable-adjusted linear mixed models with repeated measures showed that each 30-g increment in total carbohydrate was associated with increases in hunger (1.36 mm year<sup>-1</sup>, 95% CI 0.77, 1.95, P < 0.001), desire to eat (1.10 mm year<sup>-1</sup>, 0.59, 1.60, P < 0.001), desire to eat something sweet (0.99 mm year<sup>-1</sup>, 0.30, 1.68, P = 0.005), and weight regain (0.20%·year<sup>-1</sup>, 0.03, 0.36, P = 0.022). Increasing GI was associated with weight regain, but not associated with increases in appetite sensations. Each 20-unit increment in GL was associated with increases in hunger (0.92 mm year<sup>-1</sup>, 0.33, 1.51, P = 0.002), desire to eat (1.12 mm year<sup>-1</sup>, 0.62, 1.62, P < 0.001), desire to eat something sweet (1.13 mm year<sup>-1</sup>, 0.44, 1.81, P < 0.001), and weight regain (0.35%·year<sup>-1</sup>, 0.18, 0.52, P < 0.001). Surprisingly, dietary fiber was also associated with increases in desire to eat, after adjustment for carbohydrate or GL. In participants with moderate carbohydrate and dietary fiber intake, and low to moderate GI, we found that higher total carbohydrate, GL, and total fiber, but not GI, were associated with increases in subjective desire to eat or hunger over 3 years.

34836203,A Multidisciplinary Perspective of Ultra-Processed Foods and Associated Food Processing Technologies: A View of the Sustainable Road Ahead.,"Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are negatively perceived by part of the scientific community, the public, and policymakers alike, to the extent they are sometimes referred to as not ""real food"". Many observational surveys have linked consumption of UPFs to adverse health outcomes. This narrative synthesis and scientific reappraisal of available evidence aims to: (i) critically evaluate UPF-related scientific literature on diet and disease and identify possible research gaps or biases in the interpretation of data; (ii) emphasize the innovative potential of various processing technologies that can lead to modifications of the food matrix with beneficial health effects; (iii) highlight the possible links between processing, sustainability and circular economy through the valorisation of by-products; and (iv) delineate the conceptual parameters of new paradigms in food evaluation and classification systems. Although greater consumption of UPFs has been associated with obesity, unfavorable cardiometabolic risk factor profiles, and increased risk for non-communicable diseases, whether specific food processing techniques leading to ultra-processed formulations are responsible for the observed links between UPFs and various health outcomes remains elusive and far from being understood. Evolving technologies can be used in the context of sustainable valorisation of food processing by-products to create novel, low-cost UPFs with improved nutritional value and health potential. New paradigms of food evaluation and assessment should be funded and developed on several novel pillars-enginomics, signalling, and precision nutrition-taking advantage of available digital technologies and artificial intelligence. Research is needed to generate required scientific knowledge to either expand the current or create new food evaluation and classification systems, incorporating processing aspects that may have a significant impact on health and wellness, together with factors related to the personalization of foods and diets, while not neglecting recycling and sustainability aspects. The complexity and the predicted immense size of these tasks calls for open innovation mentality and a new mindset promoting multidisciplinary collaborations and partnerships between academia and industry.",Capozzi F; Magkos F; Fava F; Milani GP; Agostoni C; Astrup A; Saguy IS,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34836203/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34836170,Adherence to a Plant-Based Diet and Consumption of Specific Plant Foods-Associations with 3-Year Weight-Loss Maintenance and Cardiometabolic Risk Factors: A Secondary Analysis of the PREVIEW Intervention Study.,"Plant-based diets are recommended by dietary guidelines. This secondary analysis aimed to assess longitudinal associations of an overall plant-based diet and specific plant foods with weight-loss maintenance and cardiometabolic risk factors. Longitudinal data on 710 participants (aged 26-70 years) with overweight or obesity and pre-diabetes from the 3-year weight-loss maintenance phase of the PREVIEW intervention were analyzed. Adherence to an overall plant-based diet was evaluated using a novel plant-based diet index, where all plant-based foods received positive scores and all animal-based foods received negative scores. After adjustment for potential confounders, linear mixed models with repeated measures showed that the plant-based diet index was inversely associated with weight regain, but not with cardiometabolic risk factors. Nut intake was inversely associated with regain of weight and fat mass and increments in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Fruit intake was inversely associated with increments in diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol. Vegetable intake was inversely associated with an increment in diastolic blood pressure and triglycerides and was positively associated with an increase in HDL cholesterol. All reported associations with cardiometabolic risk factors were independent of weight change. Long-term consumption of nuts, fruits, and vegetables may be beneficial for weight management and cardiometabolic health, whereas an overall plant-based diet may improve weight management only.",Zhu R; Fogelholm M; Poppitt SD; Silvestre MP; Møller G; Huttunen-Lenz M; Stratton G; Sundvall J; Råman L; Jalo E; Taylor MA; Macdonald IA; Handjiev S; Handjieva-Darlenska T; Martinez JA; Muirhead R; Brand-Miller J; Raben A,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34836170/,0,0,0,0,1,1

34790686,Appraisal of Triglyceride-Related Markers as Early Predictors of Metabolic Outcomes in the PREVIEW Lifestyle Intervention: A Controlled <i>Post-hoc</i> Trial.,"<b>Background:</b> Individuals with pre-diabetes are commonly overweight and benefit from dietary and physical activity strategies aimed at decreasing body weight and hyperglycemia. Early insulin resistance can be estimated <i>via</i> the triglyceride glucose index {TyG = Ln [TG (mg/dl) × fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (mg/dl)/2]} and the hypertriglyceridemic-high waist phenotype (TyG-waist), based on TyG x waist circumference (WC) measurements. Both indices may be useful for implementing personalized metabolic management. In this secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we aimed to determine whether the differences in baseline TyG values and TyG-waist phenotype predicted individual responses to type-2 diabetes (T2D) prevention programs. <b>Methods:</b> The present <i>post-hoc</i> analyses were conducted within the Prevention of Diabetes through Lifestyle intervention and population studies in Europe and around the world (PREVIEW) study completers (<i>n</i> = 899), a multi-center RCT conducted in eight countries (NCT01777893). The study aimed to reduce the incidence of T2D in a population with pre-diabetes during a 3-year randomized intervention with two sequential phases. The first phase was a 2-month weight loss intervention to achieve ≥8% weight loss. The second phase was a 34-month weight loss maintenance intervention with two diets providing different amounts of protein and different glycemic indices, and two physical activity programs with different exercise intensities in a 2 x 2 factorial design. On investigation days, we assessed anthropometrics, glucose/lipid metabolism markers, and diet and exercise questionnaires under standardized procedures. <b>Results:</b> Diabetes-related markers improved during all four lifestyle interventions. Higher baseline TyG index (<i>p</i> < 0.001) was associated with greater reductions in body weight, fasting glucose, and triglyceride (TG), while a high TyG-waist phenotype predicted better TG responses, particularly in those randomized to physical activity (PA) of moderate intensity. <b>Conclusions:</b> Two novel indices of insulin resistance (TyG and TyG-waist) may allow for a more personalized approach to avoiding progression to T2D. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01777893 reference, identifier: NCT01777893.",Navas-Carretero S; San-Cristobal R; Siig Vestentoft P; Brand-Miller JC; Jalo E; Westerterp-Plantenga M; Simpson EJ; Handjieva-Darlenska T; Stratton G; Huttunen-Lenz M; Lam T; Muirhead R; Poppitt S; Pietiläinen KH; Adam T; Taylor MA; Handjiev S; McNarry MA; Hansen S; Brodie S; Silvestre MP; Macdonald IA; Boyadjieva N; Mackintosh KA; Schlicht W; Liu A; Larsen TM; Fogelholm M; Raben A; Martinez JA,Frontiers in nutrition,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34790686/,0,0,0,0,0,0

The obesity epidemic continues to increase in spite of preventative measures undertaken worldwide. Pharmacological treatments promise to reduce total fat mass. However, medications may have significant side effects and can be potentially fatal. <b>Data Retrieval</b>: This brief review, based on a PUBMED search of the key terms ""Obesity"" and"" Sarcopenia,"" will present evidence to corroborate the existence of Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) in obesity and the involvement of catecholaminergic pathways in substance seeking behavior, particularly as it relates to carbohydrates cravings. <b>Expert Opinion:</b> The genetic basis and future genetic testing of children for risk of aberrant generalized craving behavior are considered a prevention method. Here we present evidence supporting the use of precursor amino acid therapy and modulation of enkephalinase, <b><i>MOA</i></b>, and <b><i>COMT</i></b> inhibition in key brain regions. Such treatments manifest in improved levels of dopamine/norepinephrine, GABA, serotonin, and enkephalins. We also present evidence substantiating insulin sensitivity enhancement via Chromium salts, which affect dopamine neuronal synthesis regulation.

First, a comprehensive review was conducted to assess the potential research gap regarding reported interaction analyses conducted in studies assessing the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) in combination with PA on all-cause mortality. Thereafter, we prospectively assessed the joint association of the MedDiet with PA on all-cause mortality in the <i>Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra</i> (SUN) cohort, followed by both multiplicative and additive interaction analyses. The conjoint effect of low adherence to the MedDiet and low PA observed an increased risk greater than the individual risk factors, suggesting a potential additive interaction or synergism between both exposures, with relative risk due to interaction (RERI) and (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI)) = 0·46 (–0·83 to 1·75) and attributable proportion (95 % CI) due to interaction of 36 % (–0·62, 1·34). No multiplicative interaction was detected. Studying interactions between lifestyle factors, such as the MedDiet and PA, is particularly relevant given the current research gaps in studying the complexities of combined aspects of lifestyle in comparison with isolated behaviours. Our findings underline the important public health message of adhering to both the MedDiet and PA for the prevention of premature mortality.",Hershey MS; Martínez-González MÁ; Álvarez-Álvarez I; Martínez Hernández JA; Ruiz-Canela M,The British journal of nutrition,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34462020/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34453322,The triglyceride-glucose index as an adiposity marker and a predictor of fat loss induced by a low-calorie diet.,"This study aimed to investigate the putative role of the triglyceride-glucose index (TyG index) computed as ln[TG (mg/dl) × glucose (mg/dl)/2] and derived proxies as predictors of adiposity and weight loss changes after a low-calorie diet (LCD) intervention. A total of 744 adult participants from the multicentre DIOGenes intervention study were prescribed a LCD (800 kcal/day) during 8 weeks. Body composition and fat content at baseline and after 8 weeks were estimated by DEXA/BIA. A multivariate analysis approach was used to estimate the difference in ΔWeight<sub>1-2</sub> (kg), ΔBMI<sub>1-2</sub> (kg/m<sup>2</sup> ) or ΔFat<sub>1-2</sub> (%) between the basal value (point 1) and after 8 weeks following a LCD (point 2), respectively. The TyG index at baseline (TyG<sub>1</sub> ), after following the LCD for 8 weeks (TyG<sub>2</sub> ) or the TyG index differences between both time points (ΔTyG<sub>1-2</sub> ) were analysed as predictors of weight and fat changes. TyG<sub>1</sub> was associated with ΔWeight<sub>1-2</sub> (kg) and ΔBMI<sub>1-2</sub> (kg/m<sup>2</sup> ), with β = 0.812 (p = .017) and β = 0.265 (p = .018), respectively. Also, TyG<sub>2</sub>  values were inversely related to ΔFat<sub>1-2</sub> (%), β = -1.473 (p = .015). Moreover, ΔTyG<sub>1-2</sub> was associated with ΔWeight<sub>1-2</sub> (kg) and ΔFat<sub>1-2</sub> (%), β = 0.689 (p = .045) and β = 1.764 (p = .002), respectively. Furthermore, an association between TyG<sub>2</sub> and resistance to fat loss was found (p = .015). TyG<sub>1</sub> index is a good predictor of weight loss induced by LCD. Moreover, TyG<sub>2</sub> was closely related to resistance to fat loss, while ΔTyG<sub>1-2</sub>  values were positively associated with body fat changes. Therefore, TyG index and derived estimations could be used as markers of individualized responses to energy restriction and a surrogate of body composition outcomes in clinical/epidemiological settings in obesity conditions.",Vidal-Ostos F; Ramos-Lopez O; Blaak EE; Astrup A; Martinez JA,European journal of clinical investigation,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34453322/,0,0,0,0,0,0
34422879,Memorable Food: Fighting Age-Related Neurodegeneration by Precision Nutrition.,"Healthcare systems worldwide are seriously challenged by a rising prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), which mostly, but not exclusively, affect the ever-growing population of the elderly. The most known neurodegenerative diseases are Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but some viral infections of the brain and traumatic brain injury may also cause NDD. Typical for NDD are the malfunctioning of neurons and their irreversible loss, which often progress irreversibly to dementia and ultimately to death. Numerous factors are involved in the pathogenesis of NDD: genetic variability, epigenetic changes, extent of oxidative/nitrosative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and DNA damage. The complex interplay of all the above-mentioned factors may be a fingerprint of neurodegeneration, with different diseases being affected to different extents by particular factors. There is a voluminous body of evidence showing the benefits of regular exercise to brain health and cognitive functions. Moreover, the importance of a healthy diet, balanced in macro- and micro-nutrients, in preventing neurodegeneration and slowing down a progression to full-blown disease is evident. Individuals affected by NDD almost inevitably have low-grade inflammation and anomalies in lipid metabolism. Metabolic and lipid profiles in NDD can be improved by the Mediterranean diet. Many studies have associated the Mediterranean diet with a decreased risk of dementia and AD, but a cause-and-effect relationship has not been deduced. Studies with caloric restriction showed neuroprotective effects in animal models, but the results in humans are inconsistent. The pathologies of NDD are complex and there is a great inter-individual (epi)genetic variance within any population. Furthermore, the gut microbiome, being deeply involved in nutrient uptake and lipid metabolism, also represents a pillar of the gut microbiome-brain axis and is linked with the pathogenesis of NDD. Numerous studies on the role of different micronutrients (omega-3 fatty acids, bioactive polyphenols from fruit and medicinal plants) in the prevention, prediction, and treatment of NDD have been conducted, but we are still far away from a personalized diet plan for individual NDD patients. For this to be realized, large-scale cohorts that would include the precise monitoring of food intake, mapping of genetic variants, epigenetic data, microbiome studies, and metabolome, lipidome, and transcriptome data are needed.",Milošević M; Arsić A; Cvetković Z; Vučić V,Frontiers in nutrition,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34422879/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34375397,"Associations of changes in reported and estimated protein and energy intake with changes in insulin resistance, glycated hemoglobin, and BMI during the PREVIEW lifestyle intervention study.","Observed associations of high-protein diets with changes in insulin resistance are inconclusive. We aimed to assess associations of changes in both reported and estimated protein (PRep; PEst) and energy intake (EIRep; EIEst) with changes in HOMA-IR, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and BMI (in kg/m2), in 1822 decreasing to 833 adults (week 156) with overweight and prediabetes, during the 3-y PREVIEW (PREVention of diabetes through lifestyle intervention and population studies In Europe and around the World) study on weight-loss maintenance. Eating behavior and measurement errors (MEs) of dietary intake were assessed. Thus, observational post hoc analyses were applied. Associations of changes in EIEst, EIRep, PEst, and PRep with changes in HOMA-IR, HbA1c, and BMI were determined by linear mixed-model analysis in 2 arms [high-protein-low-glycemic-index (GI) diet and moderate-protein-moderate-GI diet] of the PREVIEW study. EIEst was derived from energy requirement: total energy expenditure = basal metabolic rate × physical activity level; PEst from urinary nitrogen, and urea. MEs were calculated as [(EIEst - EIRep)/EIEst] × 100% and [(PRep - PEst)/PEst] × 100%. Eating behavior was determined using the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire, examining cognitive dietary restraint, disinhibition, and hunger. Increases in PEst and PRep and decreases in EIEst and EIRep were associated with decreases in BMI, but not independently with decreases in HOMA-IR. Increases in PEst and PRep were associated with decreases in HbA1c. PRep and EIRep showed larger changes and stronger associations than PEst and EIEst. Mean ± SD MEs of EIRep and PRep were 38% ± 9% and 14% ± 4%, respectively; ME changes in EIRep and En% PRep were positively associated with changes in BMI and cognitive dietary restraint and inversely with disinhibition and hunger. During weight-loss maintenance in adults with prediabetes, increase in protein intake and decrease in energy intake were not associated with decrease in HOMA-IR beyond associations with decrease in BMI. Increases in PEst and PRep were associated with decrease in HbA1c.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01777893.",Drummen M; Adam TC; Macdonald IA; Jalo E; Larssen TM; Martinez JA; Handjiev-Darlenska T; Brand-Miller J; Poppitt SD; Stratton G; Pietiläinen KH; Taylor MA; Navas-Carretero S; Handjiev S; Muirhead R; Silvestre MP; Swindell N; Huttunen-Lenz M; Schlicht W; Lam T; Sundvall J; Raman L; Feskens E; Tremblay A; Raben A; Westerterp-Plantenga MS,The American journal of clinical nutrition,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34375397/,0,0,0,0,0,0

34366176,Physical activity and metabolic syndrome severity among older adults at cardiovascular risk: 1-Year trends.,"Modifiable lifestyle factors, such as physical activity (PA) and Mediterranean diet (MD), decrease metabolic syndrome (MetS). The aim was to assess 1-year changes of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA), sedentary behavior, and diet quality according to MetS severity in older population at high cardiovascular risk. Prospective analysis of 55-75-year-old 4359 overweight/obese participants with MetS (PREDIMED-Plus trial) categorized in tertiles according to 1-year changes of a validated MetS severity score (MetSSS). Anthropometrics, visceral adiposity index, triglycerides and glucose index, dietary nutrient intake, biochemical marker levels, dietary inflammatory index, and depression symptoms were measured. Diet quality was assessed by 17-item MD questionnaire. PAs were self-reported using the Minnesota-REGICOR Short Physical Activity Questionnaire and 30-s chair stand test. Sedentary behaviors were measured using the Spanish version of the Nurses' Health Study questionnaire. After 1-year follow-up, decreasing MetSSS was associated with an anti-inflammatory dietary pattern, high intake of vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, whole grain cereals, white fish, and bluefish and low intake of refined cereals, red and processed meat, cookies/sweets, and snacks/ready-to-eat-meals. It resulted in high intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega-3 fatty acids, protein, fiber, vitamins B1, B6, B9, C, D, potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus and low glycemic index and saturated fatty acid, trans fatty acid, and carbohydrates intake. Regarding PA and sedentary behavior, decreasing MetSSS was associated with increased moderate-to-vigorous LTPA, chair stand test, and decreased sedentary and TV-viewing time. Decreasing MetSSS was associated with an anti-inflammatory dietary pattern, high LTPA, high MD adherence, low sedentary time, and low depression risk.",Gallardo-Alfaro L; Bibiloni MDM; Bouzas C; Mascaró CM; Martínez-González MÁ; Salas-Salvadó J; Corella D; Schröder H; Martínez JA; Alonso-Gómez ÁM; Wärnberg J; Vioque J; Romaguera D; Lopez-Miranda J; Estruch R; Tinahones FJ; Lapetra J; Serra-Majem L; Bueno-Cavanillas A; Micó RM; Pintó X; Gaforio JJ; Ortíz-Ramos M; Altés-Boronat A; Luca BL; Daimiel L; Ros E; Sayon-Orea C; Becerra-Tomás N; Gimenez-Alba IM; Castañer O; Abete I; Tojal-Sierra L; Pérez-López J; Torres-Collado L; Colom A; Garcia-Rios A; Castro-Barquero S; Bernal R; Santos-Lozano JM; Fernandez-Lazaro CI; Hernández-Alonso P; Saiz C; Zomeño MD; Zulet MA; Belló-Mora MC; Basterra-Gortari FJ; Canudas S; Goday A; Tur JA,"Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34366176/,0,0,0,0,0,1
34277687,"The PERSonalized Glucose Optimization Through Nutritional Intervention (PERSON) Study: Rationale, Design and Preliminary Screening Results.","<b>Background:</b> It is well-established that the etiology of type 2 diabetes differs between individuals. Insulin resistance (IR) may develop in different tissues, but the severity of IR may differ in key metabolic organs such as the liver and skeletal muscle. Recent evidence suggests that these distinct tissue-specific IR phenotypes may also respond differentially to dietary macronutrient composition with respect to improvements in glucose metabolism. <b>Objective:</b> The main objective of the PERSON study is to investigate the effects of an optimal vs. suboptimal dietary macronutrient intervention according to tissue-specific IR phenotype on glucose metabolism and other health outcomes. <b>Methods:</b> In total, 240 overweight/obese (BMI 25 - 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) men and women (age 40 - 75 years) with either skeletal muscle insulin resistance (MIR) or liver insulin resistance (LIR) will participate in a two-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel, 12-week dietary intervention study. At screening, participants undergo a 7-point oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to determine the hepatic insulin resistance index (HIRI) and muscle insulin sensitivity index (MISI), classifying each participant as either ""No MIR/LIR,"" ""MIR,"" ""LIR,"" or ""combined MIR/LIR."" Individuals with MIR or LIR are randomized to follow one of two isocaloric diets varying in macronutrient content and quality, that is hypothesized to be either an optimal or suboptimal diet, depending on their tissue-specific IR phenotype (MIR/LIR). Extensive measurements in a controlled laboratory setting as well as phenotyping in daily life are performed before and after the intervention. The primary study outcome is the difference in change in disposition index, which is the product of insulin sensitivity and first-phase insulin secretion, between participants who received their hypothesized optimal or suboptimal diet. <b>Discussion:</b> The PERSON study is one of the first randomized clinical trials in the field of precision nutrition to test effects of a more personalized dietary intervention based on IR phenotype. The results of the PERSON study will contribute knowledge on the effectiveness of targeted nutritional strategies to the emerging field of precision nutrition, and improve our understanding of the complex pathophysiology of whole body and tissue-specific IR. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03708419, clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03708419.",Gijbels A; Trouwborst I; Jardon KM; Hul GB; Siebelink E; Bowser SM; Yildiz D; Wanders L; Erdos B; Thijssen DHJ; Feskens EJM; Goossens GH; Afman LA; Blaak EE,Frontiers in nutrition,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34277687/,0,0,0,0,0,0
34141717,"A High-Protein, Low Glycemic Index Diet Suppresses Hunger but Not Weight Regain After Weight Loss: Results From a Large, 3-Years Randomized Trial (PREVIEW).","<b>Background:</b> Previous studies have shown an increase in hunger during weight-loss maintenance (WLM) after diet-induced weight loss. Whether a combination of a higher protein, lower glycemic index (GI) diet and physical activity (PA) can counteract this change remains unclear. <b>Aim:</b> To compare the long-term effects of two diets [high protein (HP)-low GI vs. moderate protein (MP)-moderate GI] and two PA programs [high intensity (HI) vs. moderate intensity (MI)] on subjective appetite sensations during WLM after ≥8% weight loss (WL). <b>Methods:</b> Data derived from the 3-years PREVIEW randomized intervention study. An 8-weeks WL phase using a low-energy diet was followed by a 148-weeks randomized WLM phase. For the WLM phase, participants were assigned to one of the four groups: HP-MI, HP-HI, MP-MI, and MP-HI. Available data from 2,223 participants with overweight or obesity (68% women; BMI ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Appetite sensations including satiety, hunger, desire to eat, and desire to eat something sweet during the two phases (at 0, 8 weeks and 26, 52, 104, and 156 weeks) were assessed based on the recall of feelings during the previous week using visual analogue scales. Differences in changes in appetite sensations from baseline between the groups were determined using linear mixed models with repeated measures. <b>Results:</b> There was no significant diet × PA interaction. From 52 weeks onwards, decreases in hunger were significantly greater in HP-low GI than MP-moderate GI (<i>P</i> <sub>time × <i>diet</i></sub> = 0.018, <i>P</i> <sub>dietgroup</sub> = 0.021). Although there was no difference in weight regain between the diet groups (<i>P</i> <sub>time × <i>diet</i></sub> = 0.630), hunger and satiety ratings correlated with changes in body weight at most timepoints. There were no significant differences in appetite sensations between the two PA groups. Decreases in hunger ratings were greater at 52 and 104 weeks in HP-HI vs. MP-HI, and greater at 104 and 156 weeks in HP-HI vs. MP-MI. <b>Conclusions:</b> This is the first long-term, large-scale randomized intervention to report that a HP-low GI diet was superior in preventing an increase in hunger, but not weight regain, during 3-years WLM compared with a MP-moderate GI diet. Similarly, HP-HI outperformed MP-HI in suppressing hunger.

34092234,Personalised nutrition advice reduces intake of discretionary foods and beverages: findings from the Food4Me randomised controlled trial.,"The effect of personalised nutrition advice on discretionary foods intake is unknown. To date, two national classifications for discretionary foods have been derived. This study examined changes in intake of discretionary foods and beverages following a personalised nutrition intervention using these two classifications. Participants were recruited into a 6-month RCT across seven European countries (Food4Me) and were randomised to receive generalised dietary advice (control) or one of three levels of personalised nutrition advice (based on diet [L1], phenotype [L2] and genotype [L3]). Dietary intake was derived from an FFQ. An analysis of covariance was used to determine intervention effects at month 6 between personalised nutrition (overall and by levels) and control on i) percentage energy from discretionary items and ii) percentage contribution of total fat, SFA, total sugars and salt to discretionary intake, defined by Food Standards Scotland (FSS) and Australian Dietary Guidelines (ADG) classifications. Of the 1607 adults at baseline, n = 1270 (57% female) completed the intervention. Percentage sugars from FSS discretionary items was lower in personalised nutrition vs control (19.0 ± 0.37 vs 21.1 ± 0.65; P = 0.005). Percentage energy (31.2 ± 0.59 vs 32.7 ± 0.59; P = 0.031), percentage total fat (31.5 ± 0.37 vs 33.3 ± 0.65; P = 0.021), SFA (36.0 ± 0.43 vs 37.8 ± 0.75; P = 0.034) and sugars (31.7 ± 0.44 vs 34.7 ± 0.78; P < 0.001) from ADG discretionary items were lower in personalised nutrition vs control. There were greater reductions in ADG percentage energy and percentage total fat, SFA and salt for those randomised to L3 vs L2. Compared with generalised dietary advice, personalised nutrition advice achieved greater reductions in discretionary foods intake when the classification included all foods high in fat, added sugars and salt. Future personalised nutrition approaches may be used to target intake of discretionary foods. Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01530139 .

34088702,Association of Psychobehavioral Variables With HOMA-IR and BMI Differs for Men and Women With Prediabetes in the PREVIEW Lifestyle Intervention.,"Stress, sleep, eating behavior, and physical activity are associated with weight change and insulin resistance (IR). The aim of this analysis was the assessment of the overall and sex-specific associations of psychobehavioral variables throughout the 3-year PREVIEW intervention using the homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR), BMI, and length of time in the study. Associations of psychobehavioral variables, including stress, mood, eating behavior, physical activity (PA), and sleep, with BMI, HOMA-IR, and time spent in the study were assessed in 2,184 participants with prediabetes and overweight/obesity (<i>n</i> = 706 men; <i>n</i> = 1,478 women) during a 3-year lifestyle intervention using linear mixed modeling and general linear modeling.

Cognitive restraint and PA were negatively, whereas disinhibition, hunger, stress, and total mood disturbance were positively, associated with both BMI and HOMA-IR. Sleep duration, low sleep quality, total mood disturbance, disinhibition, and hunger scores were positively associated with HOMA-IR for men only. Participants who dropped out at 6 months had higher stress and total mood disturbance scores at baseline and throughout their time spent in the study compared with study completers.

33849843,Leveraging Genomic Associations in Precision Digital Care for Weight Loss: Cohort Study.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgency of addressing an epidemic of obesity and associated inflammatory illnesses. Previous studies have demonstrated that interactions between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and lifestyle interventions such as food and exercise may vary metabolic outcomes, contributing to obesity. However, there is a paucity of research relating outcomes from digital therapeutics to the inclusion of genetic data in care interventions. This study aims to describe and model the weight loss of participants enrolled in a precision digital weight loss program informed by the machine learning analysis of their data, including genomic data. It was hypothesized that weight loss models would exhibit a better fit when incorporating genomic data versus demographic and engagement variables alone. A cohort of 393 participants enrolled in Digbi Health's personalized digital care program for 120 days was analyzed retrospectively. The care protocol used participant data to inform precision coaching by mobile app and personal coach. Linear regression models were fit of weight loss (pounds lost and percentage lost) as a function of demographic and behavioral engagement variables. Genomic-enhanced models were built by adding 197 SNPs from participant genomic data as predictors and refitted using Lasso regression on SNPs for variable selection. Success or failure logistic regression models were also fit with and without genomic data. Overall, 72.0% (n=283) of the 393 participants in this cohort lost weight, whereas 17.3% (n=68) maintained stable weight. A total of 142 participants lost 5% bodyweight within 120 days. Models described the impact of demographic and clinical factors, behavioral engagement, and genomic risk on weight loss. Incorporating genomic predictors improved the mean squared error of weight loss models (pounds lost and percent) from 70 to 60 and 16 to 13, respectively. The logistic model improved the pseudo R<sup>2</sup> value from 0.193 to 0.285. Gender, engagement, and specific SNPs were significantly associated with weight loss. SNPs within genes involved in metabolic pathways processing food and regulating fat storage were associated with weight loss in this cohort: rs17300539_G (insulin resistance and monounsaturated fat metabolism), rs2016520_C (BMI, waist circumference, and cholesterol metabolism), and rs4074995_A (calcium-potassium transport and serum calcium levels). The models described greater average weight loss for participants with more risk alleles. Notably, coaching for dietary modification was personalized to these genetic risks. Including genomic information when modeling outcomes of a digital precision weight loss program greatly enhanced the model accuracy. Interpretable weight loss models indicated the efficacy of coaching informed by participants' genomic risk, accompanied by active engagement of participants in their own success. Although large-scale validation is needed, our study preliminarily supports precision dietary interventions for weight loss using genetic risk, with digitally delivered recommendations alongside health coaching to improve intervention efficacy.",Sinha R; Kachru D; Ricchetti RR; Singh-Rambiritch S; Muthukumar KM; Singaravel V; Irudayanathan C; Reddy-Sinha C; Junaid I; Sharma G; Francis-Lyon PA,Journal of medical Internet research,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33849843/,0,0,0,0,0,0
33693782,Anthropometric Variables as Mediators of the Association of Changes in Diet and Physical Activity With Inflammatory Profile.,"Mechanisms underlying the associations of high levels of physical activity (PA) and adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) with a better inflammatory profile remain unclear. Our objective was to assess the mediating role of changes in body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC), as markers of body fat in the association of changes in PA and adherence to the MedDiet, with changes in the inflammatory profile. This study included 489 adults, aged 55-75 years, from the PREDIMED-Plus multicenter lifestyle intervention trial. An inflammatory score was calculated, based on 8 blood biomarkers: high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, interleukin 18, monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1, C-peptide, leptin, and regulated on activation, normal T-cell-expressed and secreted chemokine. Biomarkers, levels of PA, score of MedDiet adherence, BMI, and WC were measured at baseline and at 1-year follow-up. Linear regression models were fitted according to the Baron and Kenny framework for mediation analysis. Changes in BMI and WC mediated the association of both changes in PA and changes in the MedDiet adherence with the inflammatory score. Body mass index mediated 26% of the association of changes in total PA with the inflammatory profile, and 27% of the association of changes in the MedDiet, while WC mediated 13% and 12% of these associations, respectively.

33672073,Energy Expenditure Improved Risk Factors Associated with Renal Function Loss in NAFLD and MetS Patients.,"To assess the efficacy of three lifestyle interventions on the reduction of liver fat content and metabolic syndrome (MetS), and whether such reductions would influence renal outcomes, we conducted a randomized controlled trial on 128 participants with MetS and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), as well as available data on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urinary albumin-to-creatine ratio (UACR). Patients were randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to either Conventional Diet, Mediterranean diet (MD)-high meal frequency, and MD-physical activity groups. Each intervention aimed at reducing caloric intake by 25%-30% of baseline intake and increase energy expenditure by 400 kcal/70 kg. Patients attended regular visits and were followed-up for 6 months. Increased albuminuria was present in 13.3% of patients, while 32.8% showed hyperfiltration. UACR reduction was associated with higher levels of UACR at baseline but not with changes in liver fat. eGFR decreased in patients presenting hyperfiltration at baseline and was associated with reduction in liver fat and insulin resistance, as well as with increase in energy expenditure (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.248, <i>p</i> = 0.006). No significant differences were observed between the three treatment groups. In patients with NAFLD and MetS, energy expenditure significantly reduced hepatic fat accumulation and insulin resistance, which reduced glomerular hyperfiltration. Increased albuminuria was reduced, but it was not associated with reduced liver fat.",Abbate M; Mascaró CM; Montemayor S; Barbería-Latasa M; Casares M; Gómez C; Angullo-Martinez E; Tejada S; Abete I; Zulet MA; Sureda A; Martínez JA; Tur JA,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33672073/,0,0,0,0,1,0
33522396,High-throughput LC-MS method to investigate postprandial lipemia: considerations for future precision nutrition research.,"Elevated postprandial lipemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, yet methods to quantitate postmeal handling of dietary lipids in humans are limited. This study tested a new method to track dietary lipid appearance using a stable isotope tracer (<sup>2</sup>H<sub>11</sub>-oleate) in liquid meals containing three levels of fat [low fat (LF), 15 g; moderate fat (MF), 30 g; high fat (HF), 60 g]. Meals were fed to 12 healthy men [means ± SD, age 31.3 ± 9.2 yr, body mass index (BMI) 24.5 ± 1.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>] during four randomized study visits; the HF meal was administered twice for reproducibility. Blood was collected over 8 h postprandially, triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins (TRL), and particles with a Svedberg flotation rate >400 (<i>S</i><sub>f</sub> > 400, <i>n</i> = 8) were isolated by ultracentrifugation, and labeling of two TG species (54:3 and 52:2) was quantified by LC-MS. Total plasma TRL-TG concentrations were threefold greater than <i>S</i><sub>f</sub> > 400-TG. Both <i>S</i><sub>f</sub> > 400- and TRL-TG 54:3 were present at higher concentrations than 52:2, and singly labeled TG concentrations were higher than doubly labeled. Furthermore, TG 54:3 and the singly labeled molecules demonstrated higher plasma absolute entry rates differing significantly across fat levels within a single TG species (<i>P</i> < 0.01). Calculation of fractional entry showed no significant differences in label handling supporting the utility of either TG species for appearance rate calculations. These data demonstrate the utility of labeling research meals with stable isotopes to investigate human postprandial lipemia while simultaneously highlighting the importance of examining individual responses. Meal type and timing, control of prestudy activities, and effects of sex on outcomes should match the research goals. The method, optimized here, will be beneficial to conduct basic science research in precision nutrition and clinical drug development.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> A novel method to test human intestinal lipid handling using stable isotope labeling is presented and, for the first time, plasma appearance and lipid turnover were quantified in 12 healthy men following meals with varying amounts of fat. The method can be applied to studies in precision nutrition characterizing individual response to support basic science research or drug development.

33402165,Targeting body composition in an older population: do changes in movement behaviours matter? Longitudinal analyses in the PREDIMED-Plus trial.,"The optimal distribution between physical activity (PA) levels and sedentary behaviour (SB) for the greatest benefits for body composition among older adults with overweight/obesity and chronic health conditions remains unclear. We aimed to determine the prospective association between changes in PA and in SB with concurrent changes in body composition and to examine whether reallocating inactive time into different physical activity levels was associated with 12-month change to body composition in older adults. Longitudinal assessment nested in the PREDIMED-Plus trial. A subsample (n = 1564) of men and women (age 55-75 years) with overweight/obesity and metabolic syndrome from both arms of the PREDIMED-Plus trial was included in the present analysis. Participants were followed up at 6 and 12 months. Physical activity and SB were assessed using validated questionnaires. Out of 1564 participants, 388 wore an accelerometer to objectively measure inactive time and PA over a 7-day period. At each time point, participants' body composition was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Standard covariate-adjusted and isotemporal substitution modelling were applied to linear mixed-effects models. Increasing 30 min of total PA and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was associated with significant reductions in body fat (β - 0.07% and - 0.08%) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) (- 13.9 g, and - 15.6 g) at 12 months (all p values < 0.001). Reallocating 30 min of inactive time to MVPA was associated with reductions in body fat and VAT and with an increase in muscle mass and muscle-to-fat mass ratio (all p values < 0.001). At 12 months, increasing total PA and MVPA and reducing total SB and TV-viewing SB were associated with improved body composition in participants with overweight or obesity, and metabolic syndrome. This was also observed when substituting 30 min of inactive time with total PA, LPA and MVPA, with the greatest benefits observed with MVPA.

33333960,Miracle Berry as a Potential Supplement in the Control of Metabolic Risk Factors in Cancer.,"The increased incidence of chronic diseases related to altered metabolism has become a social and medical concern worldwide. Cancer is a chronic and multifactorial disease for which, together with genetic factors, environmental factors are crucial. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), up to one third of cancer-related deaths could be prevented by modifying risk factors associated with lifestyle, including diet and exercise. Obesity increases the risk of cancer due to the promotion of low-grade chronic inflammation and systemic metabolic oxidative stress. The effective control of metabolic parameters, for example, controlling glucose, lipid levels, and blood pressure, and maintaining a low grade of chronic inflammation and oxidative stress might represent a specific and mechanistic approach against cancer initiation and progression. Miracle berry (MB) (<i>Synsepalum dulcificum)</i> is an indigenous fruit whose small, ellipsoid, and bright red berries have been described to transform a sour taste into a sweet one. MB is rich in terpenoids, phenolic compounds, and flavonoids, which are responsible for their described antioxidant activities. Moreover, MB has been reported to ameliorate insulin resistance and inhibit cancer cell proliferation and malignant transformation in vitro. Herein, we briefly summarize the current knowledge of MB to provide a scientific basis for its potential use as a supplement in the management of chronic diseases related to altered metabolism, including obesity and insulin resistance, which are well-known risk factors in cancer. First, we introduce cancer as a metabolic disease, highlighting the impact of systemic metabolic alterations, such as obesity and insulin resistance, in cancer initiation and progression. Next, as oxidative stress is closely associated with metabolic stress, we also evaluate the effect of phytochemicals in managing oxidative stress and its relationship with cancer. Finally, we summarize the main biological activities described for MB-derived extracts with a special focus on the ability of miraculin to transform a sour taste into a sweet one through its interaction with the sweet taste receptors. The identification of sweet taste receptors at the gastrointestinal level, with effects on the secretion of enterohormones, may provide an additional tool for managing chronic diseases, including cancer.",Gómez de Cedrón M; Wagner S; Reguero M; Menéndez-Rey A; de Molina AR,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33333960/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33235060,Cross-sectional evaluation of the interaction between activity relative-time expenditure and comorbidity concerning physical quality of life.,"Quality of life (QoL) is a matter of concern in both healthy and diseased individuals. Lifestyle factors such as physical activity and sleep have a direct impact on QoL. In this context, interactions between activity time expenditure and QoL might be different in comorbid and non comorbid patients. Besides, the quantification and evaluation of time expenditure is ordinarily measured as the absolute time devoted to each activity. The objective of this study is the evaluation of the influence and interactions of activity-relative time expenditure and co-morbidity in Physical QoL.The study involved 302 consecutive patients, from an Internal Medicine ambulatory evaluation. Validated questionnaires were used to collect demographic variables and time expenditure variables. QoL was gathered with de survey short form-36questionnaire. Comorbidity was compiled with de Charlson Comorbidity Index. SPSS v20.0 was used for statistical analysis.As hypothesized, healthy subjects had higher Physical QoL score than comorbid subjects (P < .05). Physical activity and sleep relative time expenditure were statistically significant and associated to a better QoL in comorbid patients (P < .05). Interestingly, sleep was found to have statistically significant interaction with a score of ≥2 in the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Age, gender, comorbidity, physical activity relative time expenditure, and the interaction between relative time dedicated to sleep and comorbidity were found statistically significant in a multivariate model on Physical QoL prediction.Activity-relative time expenditure could be an adequate measure of daily activity pattern in the evaluation of QoL. Relative time spent in physical activity and sleep might be positively associated to Physical QoL. Sleep and comorbidity could have a statistically significant interaction in the prediction of Physical QoL.",Suarez-Villar R; Martinez-Urbistondo D; Fernandez MA; Lopez-Cano M; Fernandez E; Dominguez A; Prosper L; Rodriguez-Cobo A; Tinoco MEC; Nadal P; Risco CR; Fernández PV; Martínez JA,Medicine,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33235060/,0,0,0,0,0,0

This review summarizes the current knowledge about the harmful effects of high-fat/high-sugar diets, micronutrient deficiencies (folate, manganese, and carotenoids), obesity and associated complications, bacterial/viral infections, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, sleep deprivation, chronic stress, air pollution, and chemical exposure on inflammation through epigenetic mechanisms. Additionally, the epigenetic phenomena underlying the anti-inflammatory potential of caloric restriction, n-3 PUFA, Mediterranean diet, vitamin D, zinc, polyphenols (i.e., resveratrol, gallic acid, epicatechin, luteolin, curcumin), and the role of systematic exercise are discussed. Original and review articles encompassing epigenetics and inflammation were screened from major databases (including PubMed, Medline, Science Direct, Scopus, etc.) and analyzed for the writing of the review paper. Although caution should be exercised, research on epigenetic mechanisms is contributing to understand pathological processes involving inflammatory responses, the prediction of disease risk based on the epigenotype, as well as the putative design of therapeutic interventions targeting the epigenome.",Ramos-Lopez O; Milagro FI; Riezu-Boj JI; Martinez JA,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

A 3-year multicentre randomized trial in eight countries using a 2 x 2 diet-by-PA factorial design was conducted. Eight-week weight reduction was followed by a 3-year randomized weight-maintenance phase. In total, 2326 adults (age 25-70 years, body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ) with prediabetes were enrolled. The primary endpoint was 3-year incidence of T2D analysed by diet treatment. Secondary outcomes included glucose, insulin, HbA1c and body weight. The total number of T2D cases was 62 and the cumulative incidence rate was 3.1%, with no significant differences between the two diets, PA or their combination. T2D incidence was similar across intervention centres, irrespective of attrition. Significantly fewer participants achieved normoglycaemia in the HP compared with the MP group (P < .0001). At 3 years, normoglycaemia was lowest in HP-HI (11.9%) compared with the other three groups (20.0%-21.0%, P < .05). There were no group differences in body weight change (-11% after 8-week weight reduction; -5% after 3-year weight maintenance) or in other secondary outcomes. Three-year incidence of T2D was much lower than predicted and did not differ between diets, PA or their combination.

32708828,Adherence to the Mediterranean Lifestyle and Desired Body Weight Loss in a Mediterranean Adult Population with Overweight: A PREDIMED-Plus Study.,"Body weight dissatisfaction is a hindrance to following a healthy lifestyle and it has been associated with weight concerns. The aim of this study was to assess the association between the adherence to the Mediterranean lifestyle (diet and exercise) and the desired body weight loss in an adult Mediterranean population with overweight. Cross-sectional analysis in 6355 participants (3268 men; 3087 women) with metabolic syndrome and BMI (Body mass index) between 27.0 and 40.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (55-75 years old) from the PREDIMED-Plus trial.

This cross-sectional analysis aimed to quantitatively measure the influence of dietary, lifestyle, and demographic factors on HRQoL. A sub-sample of the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) Project, a Mediterranean cohort, was analyzed (n = 15,674). Through self-administered questionnaires the relationship between HRQoL and dietary patterns (Mediterranean-diet (MedDiet) and provegetarian food pattern (FP) assessment), lifestyles (sleeping hours, physical activity) and demographic characteristics were measured. Multivariate linear regression and flexible regression models were used to estimate the pondered effect of personal factors on Short Form-36 (SF-36) scores. Coefficients for MedDiet and provegetarian scores (β-coefficient for global SF-36 score: 0.32 (0.22, 0.42); 0.09 (0.06, 0.12) respectively for every unit increase), physical activity (β: 0.03 (0.02, 0.03) for every metabolic equivalent of task indexes (MET)-h/week) had a positive association to HRQoL.

Information on dietary intake, adiposity, physical activity (PA), blood biomarkers and participant characteristics was collected at baseline and month 6. Benefit from the intervention was defined as ≥5 % change in the primary outcome (Healthy Eating Index) and secondary outcomes (waist circumference and BMI, PA, sedentary time and plasma concentrations of cholesterol, carotenoids and omega-3 index) at month 6. For our primary outcome, benefit from the intervention was greater in older participants, women and participants with lower HEI scores at baseline. Benefit was greater for individuals reporting greater self-efficacy for 'sticking to healthful foods' and who 'felt weird if [they] didn't eat healthily'. Participants benefited more if they reported wanting to improve their health and well-being. The characteristics of individuals benefiting did not differ by other demographic, health-related, anthropometric or genotypic characteristics. Findings were similar for secondary outcomes.

32131847,Compositional analysis of the associations between 24-h movement behaviours and cardio-metabolic risk factors in overweight and obese adults with pre-diabetes from the PREVIEW study: cross-sectional baseline analysis.,"Physical activity, sedentary time and sleep have been shown to be associated with cardio-metabolic health. However, these associations are typically studied in isolation or without accounting for the effect of all movement behaviours and the constrained nature of data that comprise a finite whole such as a 24 h day. The aim of this study was to examine the associations between the composition of daily movement behaviours (including sleep, sedentary time (ST), light intensity physical activity (LIPA) and moderate-to-vigorous activity (MVPA)) and cardio-metabolic health, in a cross-sectional analysis of adults with pre-diabetes. Further, we quantified the predicted differences following reallocation of time between behaviours. Accelerometers were used to quantify daily movement behaviours in 1462 adults from eight countries with a body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg·m<sup>- 2</sup>, impaired fasting glucose (IFG; 5.6-6.9 mmol·l<sup>- 1</sup>) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; 7.8-11.0 mmol•l<sup>- 1</sup> 2 h following oral glucose tolerance test, OGTT). Compositional isotemporal substitution was used to estimate the association of reallocating time between behaviours. Replacing MVPA with any other behaviour around the mean composition was associated with a poorer cardio-metabolic risk profile. Conversely, when MVPA was increased, the relationships with cardiometabolic risk markers was favourable but with smaller predicted changes than when MVPA was replaced. Further, substituting ST with LIPA predicted improvements in cardio-metabolic risk markers, most notably insulin and HOMA-IR. This is the first study to use compositional analysis of the 24 h movement composition in adults with overweight/obesity and pre-diabetes. These findings build on previous literature that suggest replacing ST with LIPA may produce metabolic benefits that contribute to the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes.

31870449,Isotemporal substitution of inactive time with physical activity and time in bed: cross-sectional associations with cardiometabolic health in the PREDIMED-Plus study.,"This study explored the association between inactive time and measures of adiposity, clinical parameters, obesity, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome components. It further examined the impact of reallocating inactive time to time in bed, light physical activity (LPA) or moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) on cardio-metabolic risk factors, including measures of adiposity and body composition, biochemical parameters and blood pressure in older adults. This is a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from 2189 Caucasian men and women (age 55-75 years, BMI 27-40 Kg/m<sup>2</sup>) from the PREDIMED-Plus study (http://www.predimedplus.com/). All participants had ≥3 components of the metabolic syndrome. Inactive time, physical activity and time in bed were objectively determined using triaxial accelerometers GENEActiv during 7 days (ActivInsights Ltd., Kimbolton, United Kingdom). Multiple adjusted linear and logistic regression models were used. Isotemporal substitution regression modelling was performed to assess the relationship of replacing the amount of time spent in one activity for another, on each outcome, including measures of adiposity and body composition, biochemical parameters and blood pressure in older adults. Inactive time was associated with indicators of obesity and the metabolic syndrome. Reallocating 30 min per day of inactive time to 30 min per day of time in bed was associated with lower BMI, waist circumference and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (all p-values < 0.05). Reallocating 30 min per day of inactive time with 30 min per day of LPA or MVPA was associated with lower BMI, waist circumference, total fat, visceral adipose tissue, HbA1c, glucose, triglycerides, and higher body muscle mass and HDL cholesterol (all p-values < 0.05). Inactive time was associated with a poor cardio-metabolic profile. Isotemporal substitution of inactive time with MVPA and LPA or time in bed could have beneficial impact on cardio-metabolic health.

31362802,Sex matters: a focus on the impact of biological sex on metabolomic profiles and dietary interventions.,"The metabolomic profile of a biofluid can be altered by dietary intake, exercise and disease processes and, thus provides an important tool for the study of many physiological processes. However, in addition to perturbation due to disease, the metabolomic profile of urine and plasma has also been shown to vary due to many intrinsic physiological factors such as age, sex, hormonal status and diurnal variation. Characterisation of this normal degree of variation in the metabolomic profiles of human biofluids is a necessary and important step in the development of metabolomics for use in nutrition-related research. The current review focuses on the impact of sex on the metabolomic profile. A number of studies have reported that sex impacts metabolites such as amino acids, lipids, sugars and keto acids. Furthermore, we examine the effect of the menstrual cycle on the metabolomic profile. Responses to dietary interventions can also differ between the sexes and highlighting this is important for the development of the field of precision nutrition.",Brennan L; Gibbons H,The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31362802/,1,0,0,0,0,0
31282167,Definition of nutritionally qualitative categorizing (proto)nutritypes and a pilot quantitative nutrimeter for mirroring nutritional well-being based on a quality of life health related questionnaire.,"Background: there are numerous approaches to assess nutritional status, which are putatively applied to nutritionally classify diseased people, but less information is available to study the role of environmental factors on nutritional well-being. A qualitative (nutritypes) and quantitative (nutrimeter) nutritional categorization based on dietary, lifestyle and disease criteria can be a useful nutritional approach to personalize health interventions and identify at risk individuals. Methods: cross-sectional study conducted on 102 patients (60 women), evaluating quality of life using the Short-Form 36 questionnaire (SF-36) and lifestyle factors with a general questionnaire, the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ). A nutrimeter based on physical activity, fat mass, diet and diseases (hypertension, prediabetes, obesity and dyslipidemia) data was defined with an equation to quantitatively score the nutritive well-being of the participants, and classify them into two (proto)nutritypes. Results: participants were categorized into two groups (lower/higher global health) according to quality of life. Significant or marginal statistical differences in physical activity, fat mass, diet and disease were found (all p < 0.1). Two (proto)nutritypes were identified based on participant's age, sex, fat mass, physical activity, diet and diseases. Participants classified as high nutritional well-being nutritype showed higher values for physical, mental and global health dimensions. Age, fat mass, physical activity and diet, when categorized by the median, confirm that the designed nutritional well-being nutrimeter identified two (proto)nutritypes. Conclusions: the association between phenotypical (fat mass/diseases) and lifestyle factors (diet/physical activity) with quality of life allowed categorizing individuals with a nutritional quantitative score or nutrimeter according to their nutritional well-being and discriminate two qualitative (proto)nutritypes.",de Cuevillas B; Álvarez Álvarez I; Cuervo M; Fernández Montero A; Navas Carretero S; Martínez JA,Nutricion hospitalaria,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31282167/,0,0,0,0,0,0

A 6-month RCT (Food4Me) was conducted in seven European countries between 2012 and 2013. A total of 1,125 participants were randomized to Lower- (n=562) or Higher- (n=563) Frequency Feedback groups. Participants in the Lower-Frequency group received personalized nutritional advice at baseline and at Months 3 and 6 of the intervention, whereas the Higher-Frequency group received personalized nutritional advice at baseline and at Months 1, 2, 3 and 6. The primary outcomes were change in dietary intake (at food and nutrient levels) and obesity-related traits (body weight, BMI, and waist circumference). Participants completed an online Food Frequency Questionnaire to estimate usual dietary intake at baseline and at Months 3 and 6 of the intervention. Overall diet quality was evaluated using the 2010 Healthy Eating Index. Obesity-related traits were self-measured and reported by participants via the Internet. Statistical analyses were performed during the first quarter of 2018. At 3 months, participants in the Lower- and Higher-Frequency Feedback groups showed improvements in Healthy Eating Index score; this improvement was larger in the Higher-Frequency group than the Lower-Frequency group (Δ=1.84 points, 95% CI=0.79, 2.89, p=0.0001). Similarly, there were greater improvements for the Higher- versus Lower-Frequency group for body weight (Δ= -0.73 kg, 95% CI= -1.07, -0.38, p<0.0001), BMI (Δ= -0.24 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95% CI= -0.36, -0.13, p<0.0001), and waist circumference (Δ= -1.20 cm, 95% CI= -2.36, -0.04, p=0.039). However, only body weight and BMI remained significant at 6 months. At 3 months, higher-frequency feedback produced larger improvements in overall diet quality as well as in body weight and waist circumference than lower-frequency feedback.

30646166,Association of Levels of Physical Activity With Risk of Parkinson Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"The association between physical activity and the risk of Parkinson disease (PD) has been increasingly recognized. However, to our knowledge, a comprehensive assessment of the quantitative dose-response association between physical activity and PD risk has not been performed previously. To quantify the dose-response association between physical activity and the risk of developing PD. PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were systematically searched for peer-reviewed articles published through February 2018 reporting the association between physical activity and PD risk. Prospective studies that examined the association between physical activity and PD risk were included. Data were extracted independently by 2 investigators. Adjusted risk estimates were extracted and pooled using a random-effects model. The study adhered to Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) reporting guidelines. The main outcome was the incidence of PD diagnoses confirmed by the treating neurologists or the authoritative medical records. Eight prospective studies totaling 544 336 participants included 2192 patients with PD with a median (range) follow-up period of 12 (6.1-22.0) years were identified. A significantly reduced risk of PD was associated with the highest levels of either total physical activity (relative risk, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.68-0.91) or moderate to vigorous physical activity (relative risk, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58-0.87), with stronger associations among men than among women. In contrast, light physical activity was not associated with PD risk (relative risk, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.60-1.23). The dose-response analysis revealed that for each 10 metabolic equivalent of task-hours/week increase in total or moderate to vigorous physical activity, the risk of PD among men decreased by 10% and 17%, respectively. No linear dose-response association was found between physical activity and PD risk among women. This analysis revealed an inverse dose-response association between physical activity and PD risk among men; importantly, even moderate exercise was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of PD. Future studies with quantified measurements of physical activity will help identify the precise relative risk estimates for various levels of activity with respect to PD risk.",Fang X; Han D; Cheng Q; Zhang P; Zhao C; Min J; Wang F,JAMA network open,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30646166/,0,1,0,1,0,1
30257464,Determinants of Self-Rated Health Perception in a Sample of a Physically Active Population: PLENUFAR VI Study.,"The aim of this study was to investigate determinants of self-rated health (SRH) perception in Spanish adults. This cross-sectional study including data from 11,342 participants from the Spanish PLENUFAR VI study. SRH status was grouped in two categories ('good'/'poor') and the associations of socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyles, diet adequacy and chronic disease with SRH were assessed. After adjusting for relevant confounders, the risk ratios (RR) and (95% confidence intervals) for poor SRH were 1.05 (1.03⁻1.07) for each hour of increment of sitting, 1.56 (1.30⁻1.88) for short (≥5 h vs. 7⁻8 h) sleep duration, 0.63 (0.55⁻0.72) for vigorous (vs. light) physical activity, 0.61 (0.50⁻0.74) for adequate (vs. non-adequate) diet. Activities like jogging [RR for each unit of increment in the METs-h/day = 0.87 (0.82⁻0.92)], gymnastics [0.87 (0.81⁻0.93)], biking [0.91 (0.85⁻0.98)], and track and field [0.94 (0.89⁻0.98)], were associated with better health perception. Normally weight participants with any chronic disease had lower probability to report poor SRH than overweight/obese participants with any chronic disease. Frequent consumption of bread (>2 servings/day) was associated with a lower adjusted mean of health perception scale, while higher consumption of vegetables and fruit or fish were associated with higher values, concerning good SRH. We can conclude that normal-weight participants even suffering a chronic disease had lower probability to report poor health perception than participants with overweight/obesity and a chronic disease especially for hypertension and diabetes. Activities like jogging, gymnastics, biking, and track and field, and a higher consumption of fruits, vegetables and fish, were associated with better health rated perception.",Sayón-Orea C; Santiago S; Bes-Rastrollo M; Martínez-González MA; Pastor MR; Moreno-Aliaga MJ; Tur JA; Garcia A; Martínez JA,International journal of environmental research and public health,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30257464/,0,0,0,0,0,0
30122198,Zinc transporter SLC39A11 polymorphisms are associated with chronic gastritis in the Korean population: the possible effect on spicy food intake.,"Herein, we hypothesized that ZIP11 variants would be important risk factors for chronic gastritis and that there would be an interaction effect of the relationship between their variants and spicy food intake on the development of chronic gastritis. Participants in this cross-sectional study (n = 3882 + 252) were recruited from a cohort of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study in 2001. Age, sex, education, smoking and drinking status, exercise, stress, and income level of all participants were determined by a questionnaire. Demographic and anthropometric data were collected. Fasting blood samples were collected to determine the serum levels of glucose, insulin, total bilirubin, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. The presence of chronic gastritis was defined as a confirmed diagnosis by a physician. Food consumption was determined using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. We found 8 different single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are significantly different between subjects without gastritis and those with gastritis. Of these 8 SNPs, 3 SNP (rs17183225 [C/T], rs17780814 [A/C], and rs17780820 [A/G]) are closely located in the intronic region of zinc transporter SLC39A11, commonly known as ZIP11, and show linkage disequilibrium (D' = 1.0). We also found that participants with (TCA + TCG) haplotype of ZIP11 at high levels of dietary intake of spicy foods show a significantly increasing tendency in the odds of having chronic gastritis when compared with those with CAA haplotype (odds ratio, 2.620; 95% confidence interval, 1.207-5.689). The data indicate positive associations between higher meal frequency and lower spicy food preference and gastritis. In conclusion, we found that zinc transporter gene ZIP11 is associated with chronic gastritis in the Korean population and it may interact with spicy food, which suggests ZIP11 as a therapeutic target for precision nutrition.",Ha E; Bae JH,"Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)",2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30122198/,0,0,0,0,0,0
30070117,"[Nutrigenetics, nutrigenomics and Mediterranean diet: a new vision for gastronomy].","Both nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics are disciplines that form part of what is known as Nutritional Genomics, which, in the widest sense, provides the framework for integrating different omics with food and nutrition sciences. After decades of nutrigenetic and nutrigenomic studies, there is a large enough amount of knowledge to consider its application in so-called precision nutrition. This new discipline seeks to take into account the particular characteristics of the individual in order to provide the best diet for preventing or treating a disease. Omic markers are considered to be of importance to that personalization. There are many foods, nutrients and dietary patterns that have been researched in nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics, including the Mediterranean Diet pattern. Despite heterogeneity in defining the Mediterranean Diet, there are various studies that show that the Mediterranean Diet can interact with the genome, so reducing the risk of disease in the most genetically susceptible individuals. Likewise, several studies have recently been revealing the mechanisms through which the Mediterranean Diet may exercise this protective effect. Understanding genetic susceptibility, epigenetic mechanisms, the influence of the metabolome and other omics in more detail may be important in gastronomy, understood as the practice of selecting, cooking and eating food. This omic influence can not only be found in health-disease phenotypes, but also in food taste and smell perception and preferences for certain dishes.

29233792,N-acetylcysteine supplementation increases exercise performance and reduces oxidative stress only in individuals with low levels of glutathione.,"Most of the evidence indicates that chronic antioxidant supplementation induces negative effects in healthy individuals. However, it is currently unknown whether specific redox deficiencies exist and whether targeted antioxidant interventions in deficient individuals can induce positive effects. We hypothesized that the effectiveness of antioxidant supplements to decrease oxidative stress and promote exercise performance depends on the redox status of the individuals that receive the antioxidant treatment. To this aim, we investigated whether N-acetylcysteine (NAC) supplementation would enhance exercise performance by increasing glutathione concentration and by reducing oxidative stress only in individuals with low resting levels of glutathione. We screened 100 individuals for glutathione levels and formed three groups with low, moderate and high levels (N = 36, 12 per group). After by-passing the regression to the mean artifact, by performing a second glutathione measurement, the individuals were supplemented with NAC (2 × 600mg, twice daily, for 30 days) or placebo using a double-blind cross-over design. We performed three whole-body performance tests (VO<sub>2</sub>max, time trial and Wingate), measured two systemic oxidative stress biomarkers (F<sub>2</sub>-isoprostanes and protein carbonyls) and assessed glutathione-dependent redox metabolism in erythrocytes (glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase, catalase and NADPH). The low glutathione group improved after NAC supplementation in VO<sub>2</sub>max, time trial and Wingate by 13.6%, 15.4% and 11.4%, respectively. Thirty days of NAC supplementation were sufficient to restore baseline glutathione concentration, reduce systemic oxidative stress and improve erythrocyte glutathione metabolism in the low glutathione group. On the contrary, the 30-day supplementation period did not affect performance and redox state of the moderate and high glutathione groups, although few both beneficial and detrimental effects in performance were observed. In conclusion, individuals with low glutathione levels were linked with decreased physical performance, increased oxidative stress and impaired redox metabolism of erythrocytes. NAC supplementation restored both performance and redox homeostasis.",Paschalis V; Theodorou AA; Margaritelis NV; Kyparos A; Nikolaidis MG,Free radical biology & medicine,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29233792/,0,0,0,0,0,0
28829397,Precision Nutrition: A Review of Personalized Nutritional Approaches for the Prevention and Management of Metabolic Syndrome.,"The translation of the growing increase of findings emerging from basic nutritional science into meaningful and clinically relevant dietary advices represents nowadays one of the main challenges of clinical nutrition. From nutrigenomics to deep phenotyping, many factors need to be taken into account in designing personalized and unbiased nutritional solutions for individuals or population sub-groups. Likewise, a concerted effort among basic, clinical scientists and health professionals will be needed to establish a comprehensive framework allowing the implementation of these new findings at the population level. In a world characterized by an overwhelming increase in the prevalence of obesity and associated metabolic disturbances, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, tailored nutrition prescription represents a promising approach for both the prevention and management of metabolic syndrome. This review aims to discuss recent works in the field of precision nutrition analyzing most relevant aspects affecting an individual response to lifestyle/nutritional interventions. Latest advances in the analysis and monitoring of dietary habits, food behaviors, physical activity/exercise and deep phenotyping will be discussed, as well as the relevance of novel applications of nutrigenomics, metabolomics and microbiota profiling. Recent findings in the development of precision nutrition are highlighted.

28392934,Evaluation of a web-based weight loss intervention in overweight cancer survivors aged 50 years and younger.,"Half of adult cancer survivors under age 50 years are obese. Excess body weight is associated with cancer recurrence, and effective weight loss interventions for younger cancer survivors are needed. Commercially available, online weight loss programmes are readily accessible, but few have been studied in this population. This study employed a single-arm, pre-post intervention (baseline-6 month/baseline-12 month comparisons) to preliminarily explore feasibility, efficacy and safety of an online, commercially available weight loss programme in breast (<i>n</i> = 30) and testicular (<i>n</i> = 16) cancer survivors under age 50 years. The intervention included three daily components: exercise, nutritional/behavioural modification strategies and health lessons. Intention-to-treat and completers analyses were conducted. Feasibility was measured by participation (number of participants enrolled/number screened), retention (number of participants attending 6/12 month study visit/number of enrolled) and self-reported adherence rates (average of mean percent adherence to each of the three intervention components). Efficacy was assessed by changes in initial weight (percent weight loss). Safety was assessed by adverse events. The mean participation rate was 42%. The retention rate was 59% at 6 and 49% at 12 months. The adherence rate for all participants (completers/dropouts/lost-to-follow-up) was 50.1% at 6 and 44% at 12 months. Completers reported adherence rates of 68% at 12 months. Study participants lost 5.3% body weight at 12 months; completers lost 9%. Only three unexpected adverse events (unrelated to the intervention) were reported. Clinically significant weight loss was observed, although retention rates were low. Findings generally support preliminary feasibility, efficacy and safety of this online weight loss programme, and future randomized control trials should be explored.",Lynch SM; Stricker CT; Brown JC; Berardi JM; Vaughn D; Domchek S; Filseth S; Branas A; Weiss-Trainor E; Schmitz KH; Sarwer DB,Obesity science & practice,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28392934/,0,0,0,0,0,1
28065180,Phenotypic factors influencing the variation in response of circulating cholesterol level to personalised dietary advice in the Food4Me study.,"Individual response to dietary interventions can be highly variable. The phenotypic characteristics of those who will respond positively to personalised dietary advice are largely unknown. The objective of this study was to compare the phenotypic profiles of differential responders to personalised dietary intervention, with a focus on total circulating cholesterol. Subjects from the Food4Me multi-centre study were classified as responders or non-responders to dietary advice on the basis of the change in cholesterol level from baseline to month 6, with lower and upper quartiles defined as responder and non-responder groups, respectively. There were no significant differences between demographic and anthropometric profiles of the groups. Furthermore, with the exception of alcohol, there was no significant difference in reported dietary intake, at baseline. However, there were marked differences in baseline fatty acid profiles. The responder group had significantly higher levels of stearic acid (18 : 0, P=0·034) and lower levels of palmitic acid (16 : 0, P=0·009). Total MUFA (P=0·016) and total PUFA (P=0·008) also differed between the groups. In a step-wise logistic regression model, age, baseline total cholesterol, glucose, five fatty acids and alcohol intakes were selected as factors that successfully discriminated responders from non-responders, with sensitivity of 82 % and specificity of 83 %. The successful delivery of personalised dietary advice may depend on our ability to identify phenotypes that are responsive. The results demonstrate the potential use of metabolic profiles in identifying response to an intervention and could play an important role in the development of precision nutrition.",Kirwan L; Walsh MC; Celis-Morales C; Marsaux CF; Livingstone KM; Navas-Carretero S; Fallaize R; O'Donovan CB; Woolhead C; Forster H; Kolossa S; Daniel H; Moschonis G; Manios Y; Surwillo A; Godlewska M; Traczyk I; Drevon CA; Gibney MJ; Lovegrove JA; Martinez JA; Saris WH; Mathers JC; Gibney ER; Brennan L,The British journal of nutrition,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28065180/,0,0,0,0,1,0
28057105,[Precision nutrition in the era of precision medicine].,"Precision medicine has been increasingly incorporated into clinical practice and is enabling a new era for disease prevention and treatment. As an important constituent of precision medicine, precision nutrition has also been drawing more attention during physical examinations. The main aim of precision nutrition is to provide safe and efficient intervention methods for disease treatment and management, through fully considering the genetics, lifestyle (dietary, exercise and lifestyle choices), metabolic status, gut microbiota and physiological status (nutrient level and disease status) of individuals. Three major components should be considered in precision nutrition, including individual criteria for sufficient nutritional status, biomarker monitoring or techniques for nutrient detection and the applicable therapeutic or intervention methods. It was suggested that, in clinical practice, many inherited and chronic metabolic diseases might be prevented or managed through precision nutritional intervention. For generally healthy populations, because lifestyles, dietary factors, genetic factors and environmental exposures vary among individuals, precision nutrition is warranted to improve their physical activity and reduce disease risks. In summary, research and practice is leading toward precision nutrition becoming an integral constituent of clinical nutrition and disease prevention in the era of precision medicine.",Chen PZ; Wang H,Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28057105/,0,0,0,0,0,0

A 12-month commercially available web-based lifestyle modification program (Precision Nutrition Coaching) was utilized. Cardiovascular fitness, dietary intake, leisure time activity, body composition, bone mineral density, bone structure, and muscle strength were assessed. Average adherence to all program components was 74.8 %. Women in the intervention group maintained their cardiovascular fitness level over the 12 months (1.1 ± 7.9 %), while the control group significantly decreased fitness capacity (-4.0 ± 7.5 %). There was a significant difference between groups in percent change of whole body bone area (-0.8 ± 2.5 control and 0.5 ± 1.30 intervention). We also observed decreased BMI (-4.7 ± 6.2 %) and fat mass (-8.6 ± 12.7 %) in the intervention group due to significant concomitant decreases in caloric intake and increases in caloric expenditure. The control group demonstrated decreased caloric intake and decreased lean tissue mass. In this population at high risk for detrimental cardiovascular and bone outcomes, a commercially available lifestyle intervention program mitigated a decline in cardiovascular health, improved bone health, and decreased weight through fat loss.

19108717,Recovery from a cycling time trial is enhanced with carbohydrate-protein supplementation vs. isoenergetic carbohydrate supplementation.,"In this study we assessed whether a liquid carbohydrate-protein (C+P) supplement (0.8 g/kg C; 0.4 g/kg P) ingested early during recovery from a cycling time trial could enhance a subsequent 60 min effort on the same day vs. an isoenergetic liquid carbohydrate (CHO) supplement (1.2 g/kg). Two hours after a standardized breakfast, 15 trained male cyclists completed a time trial in which they cycled as far as they could in 60 min (AM(ex)) using a Computrainer indoor trainer. Following AM(ex), subjects ingested either C+P, or CHO at 10, 60 and 120 min, followed by a standardized meal at 4 h post exercise. At 6 h post AM(ex) subjects repeated the time trial (PM(ex)). There was a significant reduction in performance for both groups in PM(ex) versus AM(ex). However, performance and power decreases between PM(ex) and AM(ex) were significantly greater (p </= 0.05) with CHO (-1.05 +/- 0.44 km and -16.50 +/- 6.74 W) vs C+P (-0.30 +/- 0.50 km and -3.86 +/- 6.47 W). Fat oxidation estimated from RER values was significantly greater (p </= 0.05) in the C+P vs CHO during the PM(ex), despite a higher average workload in the C+P group. Under these experimental conditions, liquid C+P ingestion immediately after exercise increases fat oxidation, increases recovery, and improves subsequent same day, 60 min efforts relative to isoenergetic CHO ingestion.",Berardi JM; Noreen EE; Lemon PW,Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition,2008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19108717/,0,0,0,0,0,0
