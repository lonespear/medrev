41539835,Edible mRNA platforms: The next frontier in precision functional foods.,"The tendency toward functional foods is moving not toward the fixed intake of nutrient supplementation but toward dynamic biological regulation. Nanocarriers of edible mRNA are disruptive technologies, whereby foods may serve as bioreactors to induce temporary, targeted delivery of genes without posing the threat of genomic integration. The review is the summation of 156 peer-reviewed papers (2022--2025) and industrial reports to evaluate the bases of the technology, translational prospects, and social implications of edible mRNA systems in functional foods. It is used in the fields of immunomodulation, metabolism regulation, scalable production and ethical nutrition. mRNA delivery structures, including plant lipid droplets and chitosan-alginate structures, facilitate oral stability and intestinal control. IL-10 mRNA has been used in the management of IBD, whereas FGF21 mRNA has been used to treat obesity, and milk exosome-based immune priming has been used. Although there are challenges such as mRNA degradation during processing and uncertain regulatory mechanisms, edible mRNA systems have benefits over traditional nutritional supplements, such as shorter developmental cycles and low costs. The given review offers a roadmap with the help of which it is possible to combine green synthesis, the principles of a circular economy, and AI-based personalization, which allows making mRNA foods potentially scalable answers to sustainable precision nutrition.",Liu Y; Wang L; Jin W; Pei J; Abd El-Aty AM,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41539835/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41515177,Thyroid-Microbiome Allostasis and Mitochondrial Performance: An Integrative Perspective in Exercise Physiology.,"Exercise acts as a physiological stimulus, requiring precise coordination among endocrine, microbial, and mitochondrial systems to maintain metabolic stability through allostatic regulation. The goal of the article is to integrate multidisciplinary evidence to characterize the thyroid-microbiome-mitochondrial axis as a key regulator of the allostatic state in athletic physiological response. During acute, chronic, and overload training phases, the thyroid-microbiome-mitochondrial axis operates bidirectionally, coupling microbial signaling with endocrine and mitochondrial networks to mediate metabolic response to exercise. This response shows interindividual variability driven by sex, age, genetics, and nutritional status, shaping the boundaries between adaptive efficiency and allostatic overload. Microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and secondary bile acids, modulate deiodinase activity, bile acid recycling, and mitochondrial biogenesis through AMPK-SIRT1-PGC1α signaling, optimizing substrate use and thermogenic capacity. Thyroid hormones reciprocally regulate gut motility, luminal pH, and bile secretion, maintaining microbial diversity and mineral absorption. Under excessive training load, caloric restriction, or inadequate recovery, this network becomes transiently unbalanced: SCFA synthesis decreases, D3 activity increases, and a reversible low-T<sub>3</sub>/high-rT<sub>3</sub> pattern emerges, resembling early Hashimoto- or Graves-like responses. Selenium-, zinc-, and iron-dependent enzymes form the redox link between microbial metabolism, thyroid control, and mitochondrial defense. In conclusion, the thyroid-microbiome-mitochondrial axis provides the physiological basis for the allostatic state, a reversible phase of dynamic recalibration that integrates training, nutrition, environmental stress, and circadian cues to sustain thyroid activity, mitochondrial efficiency, and microbial balance. This integrative perspective supports precision interventions to optimize recovery and performance in athletes.",Odriozola A; González A; Odriozola I; Corbi F; Álvarez-Herms J,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41515177/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41461264,Food as Medicine: Enhancing Crop Breeding and Food Processing to Shift the Gut Microbiome for Prevention and Treatment of Chronic Diseases.,"Prebiotics are useful tools for shifting the gut microbiome and metabolome to confer immune, metabolic, and preventive benefits for human disease. However, there are emerging concerns about methods for discovering optimal candidate compounds and their sustainable production for long-term success in targeting mechanisms of disease. In this perspective, we review the current state of prebiotics moving from nutrition to function in health, highlighting the opportunities for using food as medicine in treating a model disease, inflammatory bowel disease, discussing the ways crop breeding can be used to identify and improve the functional (beyond nutritional) value of a prebiotic and the critical role that food processing plays in sustaining the integrity and scalability of the prebiotic compound while influencing consumer adoption of these agents. This information supports a trajectory for the future of food as medicine to be moving from population-scale dietary guidelines to personalized or precision nutrition guidelines, from ""eat more fiber"" to ""eat this specific type of fiber that has been enhanced in and processed from this specific genotype of food crop"". This could include developing designer fibers by crop breeding to develop panels of genotypes with different fiber structures that deliver reliable shifts in the microbiome and metabolome for most patients with the targeted disease. Finally, there needs to be a commitment to sustainability of the plant-derived product so that future generations will have access to the same benefits of the food as medicine initially developed for disease prevention and treatment.",Mannon PJ; Benson AK; Schnable JC; Ding W; Juritsch AF; Rose DJ,The Journal of nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41461264/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41429531,[Research progress on precise lifestyle intervention for obesity based on genetic background].,"With the advancement of genomic technologies, precision lifestyle interventions tailored to individual genetic backgrounds have emerged as a novel approach for preventing and managing chronic diseases such as obesity. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) targeting obese or overweight populations have found that individuals with different genotypes exhibit varying responses to the same lifestyle intervention (gene-lifestyle intervention interactions). To date, more than 20 genes, including <i>FTO</i> and <i>MC4R</i>, have been identified to show such interactions, suggesting that genotype-based precision nutrition is a feasible approach. Based on this, some RCTs have compared the effectiveness of genotype-based precision interventions and one-fits-all interventions. However, current study results show considerable heterogeneity, and it remains inconclusive whether precision interventions are superior to one-fits-all interventions. Future studies should further explore precision intervention strategies, particularly by taking polygenic effects into account and integrating multi-omics data using methods such as machine learning, to provide new insights for precision interventions.",Li YX; Peng HX; Guo HD; Hou TJ; Zhang HY; Zheng Y; Tan YX; Zhang HD; Wu YQ; Qin XY; Wu T; Chen DF; Hu YH; Wang MY,Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41429531/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41367416,Regulatory mechanisms of the gut microbiota-short chain fatty acids signaling axis in slow transit constipation and progress in multi-target interventions.,"Slow-transit constipation (STC) is an increasingly prevalent disorder that imposes a substantial health and economic burden. Mounting evidence highlights the ""gut microbiota-short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-motility"" axis as a central pathophysiological link between dysbiosis and impaired colonic transit. This review synthesizes current knowledge of how SCFAs, especially acetate, propionate and butyrate, shape motility through serotonergic signaling, enteric nervous system modulation, epithelial barrier integrity and immune regulation. Particular attention is devoted to the biased-signaling properties of the SCFA receptors FFAR2 and FFAR3 (free fatty acid receptors 2 and 3, respectively), including emerging data on their heterodimerization. The article then appraises recent randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses of multi-target interventions (dietary fibers, synbiotics, postbiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, phytochemicals, and small-molecule FFAR agonists) highlighting their efficacy, safety, and translational hurdles. Finally, the authors propose a precision-medicine framework that integrates multi-omics microbiome profiling, metabolomics, and host genetics to enable phenotype-stratified therapy. Key research gaps include limited long-term safety data, heterogeneous human cohorts and the need for large multicenter trials and machine-learning-guided responder prediction. Collectively, the review provides a roadmap for shifting STC management from symptom control to mechanism-based, personalized care.",Liu SH; Yang XF; Liang L; Song BB; Song XM; Yang YJ; Alhoot MA,Frontiers in microbiology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41367416/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41306022,Molecular Insights into the Functional Roles of Variants in the <italic>FADS</italic> Gene Cluster on Omega-3 Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Synthesis.,"Omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3-LCPUFAs) have strong triglyceride-lowering and anti-inflammatory properties, and high levels of these fatty acids have been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. The synthesis of n3-LCPUFA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and n6-LCPUFA, arachidonic acid, share a common pathway mediated by fatty acid desaturase genes, FADS1 and FADS2. LCPUFA synthesis is regulated by both modifiable and non-modifiable factors. Of particular interest is the role of genetic variants in the FADS gene cluster, which are associated with altered FADS1 and FADS2 expression, as well as LCPUFA levels. However, the specific functional variants and the precise molecular mechanisms by which these variants regulate FADS gene expression remain to be elucidated. Variation in the FADS gene cluster is thought to have arisen through natural selection and changing dietary patterns. Available evidence suggests these variants, either individually or as a haplotype, may alter FADS gene expression by modifying DNA methylation in regulatory regions, as well as microRNA and transcription factor binding sites. This review explores the current state of knowledge regarding the functional roles of these variants on LCPUFA synthesis and how these new insights will help support precision nutrition strategies aimed at improving an individual's n3-LCPUFA status and health. Identifying specific functional variants in or near the FADS gene cluster and elucidating the mechanisms by which these variants impact LCPUFA synthesis requires further investigation. However, hypothesis generating in vitro studies have revealed roles for epigenetics, non-coding RNAs, and modification of transcription factor binding sites. This knowledge will generate new insights that will help improve our understanding of the genetic basis underlying LCPUFA synthesis and how this may differ across populations.",Coulson M; Mutch DM,Lifestyle genomics,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41306022/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41305652,Hidden Hunger in Pediatric Obesity: Redefining Malnutrition Through Macronutrient Quality and Micronutrient Deficiency.,"<b>Background:</b> Pediatric obesity exemplifies the paradox of energy excess coexisting with nutritional inadequacy. Despite high caloric intake, children with obesity often display deficiencies in essential macro- and micronutrients that impair growth, metabolic regulation, and long-term health. This review critically examines the mechanisms underlying malnutrition in pediatric obesity, emphasizing the interplay between dietary quality, inflammation, microbiota alterations, and biomarker profiles, and identifies research gaps limiting precision nutrition approaches. <b>Methods:</b> A comprehensive narrative review of studies addressing macro- and micronutrient intake, metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers, and gut microbiota-host interactions in pediatric obesity was conducted. Evidence from both clinical and experimental models was integrated to evaluate mechanistic pathways, diagnostic criteria, and preventive strategies. <b>Results:</b> Obesity-related malnutrition arises from poor dietary quality, systemic inflammation, and microbiota dysbiosis, leading to impaired nutrient utilization and metabolic dysfunction. Deficiencies in vitamin D, calcium, iron, magnesium, and B vitamins are common and often coexist with macronutrient imbalances. Diets rich in saturated fats and refined carbohydrates exacerbate inflammation and metabolic risk, whereas plant-based proteins, unsaturated fats, and fiber support metabolic resilience. Precision nutrition and biomarker-guided monitoring show promise but require validation in pediatric cohorts. Evidence on microbiota modulation and nutrient-gene interactions remains inconsistent, reflecting methodological heterogeneity. <b>Conclusions:</b> Malnutrition in pediatric obesity should be recognized as a distinct clinical phenotype characterized by qualitative nutrient deficiency within a state of energy surplus. Addressing this paradox demands harmonized diagnostic criteria, longitudinal biomarker surveillance, and individualized dietary strategies informed by genetics and microbiome profiling. Multilevel interventions, linking clinical practice, policy, and food system reform, are essential to prevent lifelong metabolic complications and promote healthy growth trajectories.",Dargenio VN; Sgarro N; La Grasta G; Begucci M; Castellaneta SP; Dargenio C; Paulucci L; Francavilla R; Cristofori F,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41305652/,1,0,0,0,0,1
41302083,"Nutrigenomics of Obesity: Integrating Genomics, Epigenetics, and Diet-Microbiome Interactions for Precision Nutrition.","Obesity is a highly complex, multifactorial disease influenced by dynamic interactions among genetic, epigenetic, environmental, and behavioral determinants that explicitly position genetics as the core. While advances in multi-omic integration have revolutionized our understanding of adiposity pathways, translation into personalized clinical nutrition remains a critical challenge. This review systematically consolidates emerging insights into the molecular and nutrigenomic architecture of obesity by integrating data from large-scale GWAS, functional epigenomics, nutrigenetic interactions, and microbiome-mediated metabolic programming. The primary aim is to systematically organize and synthesize recent genetic and genomic findings in obesity, while also highlighting how these discoveries can be contextualized within precision nutrition frameworks. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science up to July 2024 using MeSH terms, nutrigenomic-specific queries, and multi-omics filters. Eligible studies were classified into five domains: monogenic obesity, polygenic GWAS findings, epigenomic regulation, nutrigenomic signatures, and gut microbiome contributions. Over 127 candidate genes and 253 QTLs have been implicated in obesity susceptibility. Monogenic variants (e.g., <i>LEP</i>, <i>LEPR</i>, <i>MC4R</i>, <i>POMC</i>, <i>PCSK1</i>) explain rare, early-onset phenotypes, while <i>FTO</i> (polygenic) and <i>MC4R</i> (monogenic mutations as well as common polygenic variants) represent major loci across populations. Epigenetic mechanisms, dietary composition, physical activity, and microbial diversity significantly recalibrate obesity trajectories. Integration of genomics, functional epigenomics, precision nutrigenomics, and microbiome science presents transformative opportunities for personalized obesity interventions. However, translation into evidence-based clinical nutrition remains limited, emphasizing the need for functional validation, cross-ancestry mapping, and AI-driven precision frameworks. Specifically, this review systematically identifies and integrates evidence from genomics, epigenomics, nutrigenomics, and microbiome studies published between 2000 and 2024, applying structured inclusion/exclusion criteria and narrative synthesis to highlight translational pathways for precision nutrition.",Farzand A; Rohin MAK; Awan SJ; Ahmad AMR; Akram H; Saleem T; Imran MM,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41302083/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41228448,Zinc as a Modulator of miRNA Signaling in Obesity.,"<b>Background</b>: Obesity is a multifactorial metabolic disorder influenced not only by excessive caloric intake but also by micronutrient imbalances such as zinc deficiency. Emerging evidence suggests that zinc regulates microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis and expression, linking nutritional status to metabolic regulation. <b>Objective</b>: This review delineates the molecular interplay between zinc and miRNAs in obesity, emphasizing the mechanistic, clinical, and translational relevance of zinc-sensitive miRNAs in adipogenesis, insulin resistance, inflammation, and oxidative stress. <b>Results</b>: Zinc deficiency alters miRNA expression profiles associated with metabolic dysregulation. Key miRNAs-miR-21, miR-34a, miR-122, and miR-144-3p-are consistently modulated by zinc status, influencing inflammation, lipid metabolism, and insulin signaling. Zinc repletion restores several miRNAs (e.g., miR-10b, miR-155, miR-145), suggesting reversibility, while excessive zinc may upregulate miR-144-3p and exacerbate oxidative stress. Circulating and exosomal miRNAs show promise as dynamic biomarkers for zinc intervention efficacy. <b>Methods</b>: A literature search was performed in 4 databases up to August 2025 using keywords related to zinc, miRNAs, and obesity. Eligible studies included both preclinical and human research evaluating zinc status or supplementation and miRNA expression in metabolic contexts. <b>Conclusion</b>: Maintaining optimal zinc levels may normalize miRNA expression and improve insulin sensitivity.

41228418,Nutritional Approaches in Neurodegenerative Disorders: A Mini Scoping Review with Emphasis on SPG11-Related Conditions.,"<b>Background:</b> Neurodegenerative diseases, including spastic paraplegia type 11 (SPG11), are complex disorders characterized by progressive neurological decline and significant metabolic disturbances. Spatacsin, the protein encoded by the SPG11 gene, plays a critical role in autophagy and lysosomal homeostasis, which are essential for neuronal health. Its impairment leads to defective cellular clearance and neurodegeneration. Recently, personalized and precision nutrition have emerged as promising approaches to enhance clinical outcomes by tailoring dietary interventions to individual genetic, metabolic, and phenotypic profiles. <b>Objectives:</b> This mini scoping review aimed to synthesize current evidence on the application of personalized and precision nutrition in SPG11 and to explore how insights from related neurodegenerative diseases could inform the development of future dietary and metabolic interventions for this rare disorder. <b>Methods:</b> Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, a scoping review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases (2020-2024). Eligible studies included investigations addressing nutritional, genomic, or metabolic interventions in neurodegenerative diseases. Of 30 screened papers, nine met the inclusion criteria, primarily focusing on nutritional and metabolic interventions related to neurodegenerative and neuromuscular conditions. <b>Results:</b> To date, no dietary intervention trials have been conducted specifically for SPG11. However, evidence from studies on related neurodegenerative diseases suggests that antioxidant, mitochondrial-supportive, and microbiota-targeted dietary approaches may beneficially influence key pathological processes such as oxidative stress, lipid dysregulation, and autophagy-core mechanisms that are also central to SPG11 pathophysiology. <b>Conclusions:</b> Although current evidence remains preliminary, personalized nutrition is a promising supplementary strategy for managing neurodegenerative diseases, including SPG11. Future research should incorporate systems-based approaches that combine dietary, metabolic, and neuroimaging assessments, with sex and comorbidity-stratified analyses, multi-omics profiling, and predictive modeling. These frameworks could help design safe, effective, and personalized nutritional interventions aimed at enhancing metabolic resilience and slowing disease progression in SPG11.",Ribeiro PR; Ferreira C; Antunes C; Dias G; Lima MJ; Guiné R; Teixeira-Lemos E,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41228418/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Epigenetics and Possible Future Perspective.","This review provides an overview of the relationship among nutritional, environmental, and genetic factors in the development of the chronic inflammatory state, starting from the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) up to the onset of Colorectal Cancer (CRC). Finally, it also examines potential prospects and future topics of research taking into account the relation between nutrition and epigenetic factors. Evidence indicates that genetic and lifestyle-related factors play a crucial role in CRC etiology. Dietary intake may induce epigenetic alterations which in turn, result in carcinogenesis. Several bioactive components can modify epigenetic mechanisms, required for gene activation or silencing, thus, representing a potential way of preventing CRC. The gene-diet interaction analysis suggested some functions and pathways that may affect the CRC development. In this view, personalized nutrition, which is an approach that combines with new omics technologies, could represent a new possible key for personalized prevention and treatment in association with other cancer prevention and chemotherapeutic therapies.",Brandolino S; Franzago M; Murmura G; Ricci F; Gatta V; Stuppia L; Vitacolonna E,Current nutrition reports,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41108343/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41056462,"Precision Nutritional Genomics, Gut Microbiota and Artificial Intelligence in Chronic Kidney Disease.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a prevalent global health issue, and nutritional management of CKD is an integral component through all stages of the disease. However, response to dietary interventions varies, potentially due to genetic variations influencing metabolic pathways. This review highlights key gene-diet interactions relevant to CKD management, including risk factors and comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and proteinuria. Variants in the <i>ACE</i> gene influence salt sensitivity and blood pressure responses, while <i>TCF7L2</i> polymorphisms affect the relationship between dietary glycemic load and diabetes risk, impacting kidney complications. Protein intake, a key modifier of CKD, correlates with proteinuria risk, moderated by a <i>PPM1K</i> polymorphism. Dietary bioactives, such as caffeine, may also alter the progression rate of proteinuria and hypertension, with effects contingent upon <i>CYP1A2</i> genotype. Additional markers of cardiovascular disease, CKD-associated bone-mineral disease, and CKD anemia are also discussed as well as role of the gut microbiome in nutrition modulation and vice versa. The review concludes with the potential of artificial intelligence as a clinical tool to refine precision nutrition, enabling clinicians to adopt targeted approaches, stratified by genetic-metabolic patient profiles that match best nutritional interventions for prevention and management of CKD. Vitamin D is used as a model nutrient to illustrate a simulated framework for precision nutrition, incorporating molecular mechanisms, genetic variation, epigenetic modifications, and translational tools applicable to both population health and clinical practice.",Mahdavi S,Journal of the American Nutrition Association,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41056462/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41043686,Ingestive Behavior and Precision Nutrition: Part of the Puzzle.,"The marked individual variability in response to common dietary exposures necessitates tailoring of dietary guidance to individuals, or small groups of individuals with similar needs, to optimize health. This is a complex task requiring integration of environmental, cultural, psychological, and biological contributions. Work in the area of precision nutrition is an effort to translate science into practice. A research roadmap developed through a National Institutes of Health conference identified many of the inputs that require quantification. Better characterization of ingestive behaviors is one key area. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize current understanding of the influences of age, sex, body mass index, ethnicity, and genetics on ingestive behaviors, including culture, sensory function, appetite, dietary intake, the gut-brain axis, and microbiome. To do so, the extant literature was accessed through search engines relevant to the various topics covered. Outcomes assessed varied topically. In addition to compiling evidence on the nature and magnitude of these relationships, this review highlights the degree of individual variability in attributes or responses to an intervention. More broadly, it documents: 1) that cause-and-effect relationships are difficult to establish as most are dynamic and interactive; 2) there are inherent and learned contributions to both behavior and biology that will require different considerations and offer different opportunities for manipulation; 3) a focus on intuitive approaches may not be as successful as desired; 4) that external influences can, and often do, override internal influences of biology; and 5) there are multiple ways to construct healthful diets. At the same time, it is vital that improved methods to characterize the multiple relevant inputs to ingestive behavior be developed. It is hoped that the evidence compiled here will inform efforts to develop precision nutrition guidance.",Biruete A; Buobu PS; Considine RV; Met Hoxha E; Eicher-Miller HA; Kinzig KP; Panjwani AA; Running CA; Rutigliani G; Savaiano DA; Veile A; Wolf PG; Mattes RD,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41043686/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41036659,"Klotho, Kidneys, and Micronutrient Signaling: A Promising Paradigm for Healthy Aging.","Klotho, a transmembrane protein with pleiotropic antiaging properties, is increasingly recognized as a central regulator of longevity and metabolic resilience. Primarily expressed in the kidneys and brain, Klotho governs phosphate and calcium homeostasis, modulates redox signaling, and influences key metabolic pathways, including PI3K/AKT and IGF-1. Declining Klotho expression is associated with both biological and chronological aging and has been mechanistically implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration, and metabolic dysfunction. Klotho expression is modifiable through diet, in preclinical and observational studies, offering a promising avenue for delaying cellular aging and preserving physiological function. Micronutrients such as magnesium, vitamin D, folate, and vitamin B12, as well as phytochemicals including sulforaphane and curcumin, have been shown to modulate Klotho expression through redox-sensitive and transcriptional mechanisms. Macronutrient balance, particularly carbohydrate quality and saturated fat intake, also plays a critical role in maintaining Klotho activity via insulin sensitivity, mitochondrial integrity, and inflammatory signaling. Inflammatory dietary profiles, quantified through tools such as the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII), have been inversely associated with serum α-Klotho concentrations and biological age acceleration. This review critically synthesizes current knowledge on nutrient-specific and dietary pattern-level influences on Klotho, with emphasis on antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and epigenetically active compounds. In parallel, the Klotho-FGF23 axis is examined regarding dietary calcium and phosphate regulation, highlighting the distinct effects of whole food-derived versus supplemental calcium on mineral metabolism and vascular health. Klotho emerges as a potential modifiable determinant with current limitations as a potential biomarker within precision nutrition strategies aimed at extending health span and attenuating age-related disease risk. Key concepts discussed include dietary factors in Klotho modulation and chronic disease prevention. Opportunities and limitations of soluble Klotho as a multifaceted biomarker of human health and longevity are highlighted.",Mahdavi S,Lifestyle genomics,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41036659/,1,0,0,0,0,0
41002985,Impact of Dietary Interventions on the Human Plasma and Lipoprotein Lipidome.,"Lipids are structurally diverse biomolecules that play essential roles in cellular function, energy storage, and signaling. The human lipidome, a dynamic and complex subset of the metabolome, is shaped by both endogenous factors, such as genetics, sex, age, and metabolic health, and exogenous influences like lifestyle, diet, and microbiota. Among these, diet stands out as one of the most modifiable and impactful determinants, influencing lipid composition across plasma, serum, and lipoprotein fractions. While traditional lipid profiling provides limited insight, lipidomics enables comprehensive characterization of lipid species, revealing mechanistic links between lipid metabolism and diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), metabolic syndrome (MetS), and inflammatory disorders. This review explores: (1) the relationship between lipid profiles and CVD risk, (2) the internal and external modulators of the lipidome, and (3) current evidence on how specific dietary patterns, including Mediterranean, Nordic, low glycemic, and vegetarian diets, and individual nutrients such as omega-3 fatty acids (FAs), plant sterols, and mycoprotein, influence lipidomic profiles. Advances in lipidomics highlight that dietary fat quality, food matrix, and eating patterns can significantly modulate lipid species such as triacylglycerols (TAGs), ceramides (Cers), and phospholipids, with implications for cardiometabolic health. Notably, distinct responses are observed across plasma High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) and Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) lipidomes, emphasizing the need for compartment-specific analyses. Understanding these diet-lipidome interactions offers promising avenues for precision nutrition and the development of lipid-based biomarkers for disease prevention and management.",Casas R; Sánchez-García ND; Estruch R; López-Yerena A,Metabolites,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41002985/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40897609,Translational biomarkers for integrated cardiovascular disease risk assessment: A multidisciplinary review with applications in precision medicine.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, significantly impacting healthcare systems and individual lives. This pragmatic review focuses on the assessment of CVD utilizing traditional and emerging risk factors that provide a basis for personalized medicine and precision nutrition, highlighting the knowledge and application of these insights for accurate risk diagnosis, individualized interventions, and precise outcome/evaluation prognosis. Critical biochemical markers such as lipid metabolism signatures, inflammatory molecules, endocrine mediators, homeostatic signals (including omics data), and lifestyle factors such as unhealthy dietary habits, physical inactivity, smoking, alcohol abuse, along with anthropometric variables and body composition measurements, play a pivotal role in assessing and managing CVD. This progression starts with early vascular and cardiac dysfunctions, advancing to atherosclerosis, and ultimately leading to cardiovascular events. Major adverse cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure, highlight the need for effective and accurate risk stratification and objective assessment. Various CVD risk scores, such as the Framingham Risk Score, SCORE, and the Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Calculator, provide valuable global frameworks for predicting individual risk based on recognized conventional factors. Additionally, omics markers-which encompass genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and metagenomic data-offer deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying CVD, alongside novel lipidomic and immunomic determinants.

40896188,"Precision nutrition across climates: decoding diet, tradition, and genomic adaptations from South Asia to the Arctic.","Human populations have developed distinct genetic adaptations to diet in response to changes in lifestyle and environments in which they live. Particularly contrasting patterns of dietary adaptations are expected in populations living in tropical versus extreme cold environments. This article explores the genetic, dietary, and microbiome-related adaptations in populations of South Asia and the Arctic. We review adaptations related to high-carbohydrate, plant-based diets in South Asians and compare these against adaptations in Arctic populations who have evolved to rely on fat- and protein-rich diets from marine and animal sources. We discuss how these genetic adaptations interact with traditional diets and microbiomes, and the implications for chronic disease risks as modern, westernized diets disrupt ancestral gene-diet-microbiome interactions. By comparing these regions, we highlight the need for genome-based nutrition created strategies that account for genetic diversity, local dietary traditions, and environmental context to promote precision health and prevent diet-related chronic diseases.

40871725,Integrating Precision Medicine and Digital Health in Personalized Weight Management: The Central Role of Nutrition.,"Obesity is a global health challenge marked by substantial inter-individual differences in responses to dietary and lifestyle interventions. Traditional weight loss strategies often overlook critical biological variations in genetics, metabolic profiles, and gut microbiota composition, contributing to poor adherence and variable outcomes. Our primary aim is to identify key biological and behavioral effectors relevant to precision medicine for weight control, with a particular focus on nutrition, while also discussing their current and potential integration into digital health platforms. Thus, this review aligns more closely with the identification of influential factors within precision medicine (e.g., genetic, metabolic, and microbiome factors) but also explores how these factors are currently integrated into digital health tools. We synthesize recent advances in nutrigenomics, nutritional metabolomics, and microbiome-informed nutrition, highlighting how tailored dietary strategies-such as high-protein, low-glycemic, polyphenol-enriched, and fiber-based diets-can be aligned with specific genetic variants (e.g., FTO and MC4R), metabolic phenotypes (e.g., insulin resistance), and gut microbiota profiles (e.g., <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> abundance, SCFA production). In parallel, digital health tools-including mobile health applications, wearable devices, and AI-supported platforms-enhance self-monitoring, adherence, and dynamic feedback in real-world settings. Mechanistic pathways such as gut-brain axis regulation, microbial fermentation, gene-diet interactions, and anti-inflammatory responses are explored to explain inter-individual differences in dietary outcomes. However, challenges such as cost, accessibility, and patient motivation remain and should be addressed to ensure the effective implementation of these integrated strategies in real-world settings. Collectively, these insights underscore the pivotal role of precision nutrition as a cornerstone for personalized, scalable, and sustainable obesity interventions.",Liu X; Xu M; Wang H; Zhu L,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40871725/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40737867,Precision nutrition for obesity management: A gut microbiota-centered weight-loss approach.,"Obesity is a complex and multifactorial condition strongly associated with metabolic burdens and cardiovascular diseases. This review focuses on precision nutrition as a strategy for obesity management, exploring how personalized interventions can modulate the composition and functionality of the gut microbiome to promote weight loss and improve metabolic health. A growing body of evidence suggests that imbalances in gut microbiota composition directly impact lipid metabolism, immune and inflammatory pathways, and appetite regulation mechanisms. Furthermore, the review discusses the relationship between gut microbiota and dietary factors, highlighting how certain types of diets (such as the Mediterranean diet and fiber-rich diets) can promote the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and the growth of beneficial bacteria associated with weight regulation and reduced inflammation. While diet is the primary factor modulating the gut microbiota, factors such as genetics and epigenetic characteristics, body composition, maternal nutritional, type of birth delivery, physical activity and even drug use also play significant roles in this modulation. Although the use of precision nutrition approaches still faces challenges, such as cost and variability in individual response, the integration of omics technologies, artificial intelligence, and machine learning appear to offer great potential as tools to identify specific microbial and genetic profiles that allow for the personalization of nutritional interventions. These technologies enable large-scale analysis of dietary, genomic, and microbial factors to create dietary strategies to prevent or treat obesity that meet the specific metabolic needs of each individual. Thus, the application of these tools in clinical settings could transform obesity management, creating data-driven interventions that enhance treatment effectiveness.",Carvalho LM; da Mota JCNL; Ribeiro AA; Carvalho BG; Martinez JA; Nicoletti CF,"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40737867/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40732992,Orchestrating Nutrient Homeostasis: RNA-Binding Proteins as Molecular Conductors in Metabolic Disease Pathogenesis.,"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are critical regulators of post-transcriptional processes, playing essential roles in nutrient metabolism and metabolic homeostasis. This literature review explores how RBPs influence the metabolism of glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism by controlling processes like mRNA stability and translation regulation. The dysregulation of RBPs, including HuR, PTB, and YTHDF1, is linked to metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Advances in techniques like TREX technology and transcriptome analysis have deepened our understanding of RBP functions. Additionally, RBPs show promise as potential biomarkers and targets for new therapies. Future research directions in RBPs could focus on tissue-specific regulation and nutrient-RBP interactions. This could pave the way for more personalized treatments and improved metabolic health.",Sun S; Li X; Zhai J; Lu C; Yu W; Wu W; Chen J,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40732992/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40732941,Gut Microbiota in Women with Eating Disorders: A New Frontier in Pathophysiology and Treatment.,"Emerging evidence highlights the critical role of the gut microbiota in the development and progression of eating disorders (EDs), particularly in women, who are more frequently affected by these conditions. Women with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder exhibit distinct alterations in gut microbiota composition compared to healthy controls. These alterations, collectively termed dysbiosis, involve reduced microbial diversity and shifts in key bacterial populations responsible for regulating metabolism, inflammation, and gut-brain signaling. The gut microbiota is known to influence appetite regulation, mood, and stress responses-factors closely implicated in the pathogenesis of EDs. In women, hormonal fluctuations related to menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause may further modulate gut microbial profiles, potentially compounding vulnerabilities to disordered eating. Moreover, the restrictive eating patterns, purging behaviors, and altered dietary intake often observed in women with EDs exacerbate microbial imbalances, contributing to intestinal permeability, low-grade inflammation, and disturbances in neurotransmitter production. This evolving understanding suggests that microbiota-targeted therapies, such as probiotics, prebiotics, dietary modulation, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), could complement conventional psychological and pharmacological treatments in women with EDs. Furthermore, precision nutrition and personalized microbiome-based interventions tailored to an individual's microbial and metabolic profile offer promising avenues for improving treatment efficacy, even though these approaches remain exploratory and their clinical applicability has yet to be fully validated. Future research should focus on sex-specific microbial signatures, causal mechanisms, and microbiota-based interventions to enhance personalized treatment for women struggling with eating disorders.",Marano G; Rossi S; Sfratta G; Acanfora M; Anesini MB; Traversi G; Lisci FM; Rinaldi L; Pola R; Gasbarrini A; Sani G; Gaetani E; Mazza M,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40732941/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40714351,"Integrating biological age, epigenetic clocks, and telomere length in precision nutrition strategies for chronic disease management: Potential frameworks and ongoing challenges.","Precision nutrition is emerging as a transformative strategy for optimizing health, particularly in the context of biological aging and chronic disease prevention. This review aims to examine how biological age markers-specifically telomere length and epigenetic clocks-can be integrated into precision nutrition frameworks to personalize interventions, enhance chronic disease management, and support healthy aging. Telomere length is a widely studied biomarker of aging and chronic disease risk, while epigenetic clocks, based on DNA methylation patterns, offer complementary insights into biological age, gene expression, and disease susceptibility. Nutritional interventions rich in antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, polyphenols, B vitamins, and anti-inflammatory compounds have shown potential to modulate these biomarkers, supporting cellular health and delaying aging processes. In addition, lifestyle factors such as physical activity, stress management, and adequate sleep play critical roles in maintaining telomere integrity and epigenetic stability. However, challenges remain in translating these biomarkers into clinical practice. Importantly, variability is not the only barrier; most of these biomarkers still lack clinical validation, and there is no consensus on standardized protocols or reference values that would support their routine application in healthcare. Current guidelines recommend combining telomere length and epigenetic age with other molecular markers, such as multi-omics data, within integrative biological age assessment approaches. Nevertheless, translating this approach into clinical practice will require overcoming significant limitations, including the validation of biomarkers, standardization of measurement techniques, cost-effectiveness, and the development of clear clinical guidelines. Continued research is essential to confirm their predictive value and practical utility in precision nutrition strategies aimed at promoting healthy aging and preventing chronic diseases.",Carvalho BG; Ribeiro AA; da Mota JCNL; Carvalho LM; Nicoletti CF,"Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40714351/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40700711,Interactional Effects of Food Macronutrients with Gut Microbiome: Implications for Host Health and Risk.,"Macronutrients in the diet (e.g., carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids) that are rarely absorbed in the small intestine can typically traverse to the colon where they are metabolized by the gut microbiota to produce a spectrum of beneficial or detrimental metabolites. These gut-microbiota-dependent small-molecule metabolites are subsequently absorbed by the intestinal mucosa to participate in various physiological responses. Notably, succinate as a star dicarboxylic acid metabolite stemming from microbial fermentation of nondigestible carbohydrates regulates blood glucose homeostasis by promoting intestinal gluconeogenesis while inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, protein- or tryptophan-derived indole metabolites have emerged as a promising target for modulating neuropathic diseases. Fascinatingly, the linkage between gut microbiota and lncRNA <i>Snhg9</i> introduces a novel promising dimension for modulating lipid absorption, metabolism, and storage. Ongoing advancements in elucidating the interplay between macronutrients, gut microbiota, and host health may facilitate the development of gut microbiota-directed clinical precision nutrition strategies through intake of tailored macronutrients.",Tan Z; Yang C; Zhao Y; Yang X; Li T,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40700711/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40589935,A Scoping Review of Epigenetic Signatures of Diet and Diet-related Metabolites: Insights from Epigenome-Wide Association Studies and Their Implications for Cardiometabolic Health and Diseases.,"Epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) have emerged as a powerful approach to investigate how dietary exposures shape the epigenome and subsequently influence metabolic and cardiovascular health. A growing number of EWAS have examined the effects of various dietary factors, including overall dietary patterns, specific food groups, micronutrients, and food-related metabolites, on DNA methylation (DNAm) across diverse populations. In this review, we map the landscape of nutritional EWAS, identifying the types of dietary exposures studied, the genomic regions where epigenetic signals emerge, and overarching trends across studies. Across studies, consistent associations were reported at nine CpG sites in genes such as <i>AHRR</i>, <i>CPT1A</i>, and <i>FADS2</i>, particularly in relation to fatty acid consumption, and certain diet patterns. Biological pathways enriched included fatty acid metabolism and the PPAR signaling pathway. In conclusion, our review identified a pattern of epigenetic convergence that may underlie diet-related disease risk. While promising, key knowledge gaps were also noted, including limited longitudinal follow-up, unclear causal pathways, and underrepresentation of ethnic diversity. Moving forward, we highlighted several complementary approaches for translating nutritional EWAS findings into actionable public health and precision nutrition strategies, including integrating multi-omics, mediation analyses, and population-wide epigenetic risk profiling.",Asif R; Liu R; de Souza RJ; Azab S; Chong M; Anand SS; Deng WQ,The Yale journal of biology and medicine,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40589935/,0,0,0,0,0,1
40516614,Exploring genetic modifiers influencing adult eating behaviour: A scoping review.,"Disruptive eating behaviors can negatively impact psychological well-being and increase the risk of metabolic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. While behavioral strategies remain central to dietary interventions, emerging research highlights genetic factors, particularly single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as contributors to individual differences in eating behaviors. This scoping review maps existing research on genetic modifiers of adult eating behaviors, identifying key variants and genetic predispositions. An extensive systematic search was conducted across 12 electronic databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, alongside relevant grey literature. Sixty-five studies published from 2014 to April 2024 met inclusion criteria. Data were synthesized using Covidence and NVivo for thematic mapping. Studies were eligible if they utilized genotyping to examine genetic markers, variations, or SNPs in relation to adult eating behaviors using validated questionnaires and/or dietary interventions. Six key themes emerged: taste perception; appetite and satiety; emotional eating; disinhibition; food timing and eating habits; and snacking, craving and binge eating. Frequently studied genes included CD36, MC4R, FTO, TAS1R, TAS2R, SLC4A5, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, DRD2, CLOCK, ADIPOQ and CA6, with some studies incorporating genetic risk scores. Across reviewed studies, there was a female predominance (female-to-male ratio of 1.6:1), while older adults were underrepresented (mean age: 35.2 ± 8.4 years). Cross-sectional study designs (58 %), highlighted a methodological gap, underscoring the need for longitudinal research to explore causality. This review provides valuable insights into the genetic underpinnings of eating behaviors and emphasizes the need for future research in more diverse populations to support precision nutrition strategies.",Brown JE; Morton L; Braakhuis AJ,Appetite,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40516614/,0,0,0,0,0,1

This review synthesizes mechanistic insights demonstrating how live starter cultures and their fermentation-derived metabolites (short-chain fatty acids, bioactive peptides, and exopolysaccharides) act synergistically to enhance microbial diversity, reinforce epithelial barrier integrity via upregulation of tight-junction proteins, and modulate immune signaling. Clinical evidence supports significant improvements in metabolic parameters (fasting glucose, lipid profiles, blood pressure) and reductions in systemic inflammation across metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and IBS cohorts. We highlight critical modulatory factors-including strain specificity, host enterotypes and FUT2 genotype, fermentation parameters, and matrix composition-that govern probiotic engraftment, postbiotic yield, and therapeutic efficacy. Despite promising short-term outcomes, current studies are limited by heterogeneous designs and brief intervention periods, underscoring the need for long-term, adaptive trials and integrative multi-omics to establish durability and causality. Looking forward, precision nutrition frameworks that harness baseline microbiota profiling, host genetics, and data-driven fermentation design will enable bespoke fermented dairy formulations, transforming these traditional foods into next-generation functional matrices for targeted prevention and management of metabolic, inflammatory, and neuroimmune disorders.",Gao Y; Liu Y; Ma T; Liang Q; Sun J; Wu X; Song Y; Nie H; Huang J; Mu G,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40509473/,1,0,0,0,0,0
40504085,"Innovations in Quail Welfare: Integrating Environmental Enrichment, Nutrition and Genetic Advances for Improved Health and Productivity.","The demand for ethical and sustainable poultry production is driving up the importance of quail welfare. Because quail meat and eggs are in high demand, quails are frequently kept in harsh production environments that may harm their health and well-being. This review examines contemporary developments that combine enhanced nutrition, environmental enrichment and genetic improvements to improve quail well-being. By concentrating on these essential elements, we offer a thorough synopsis of tactics that can improve the welfare and productivity of quails in industrial environments. Enhancing the environment for quail has shown to be a successful strategy. It has been demonstrated that adding naturalistic elements, such as perches, materials for dust bathing and different lighting, reduces stress, promotes natural behaviours and enhances general health. We analysed the influence of innovative feeding on immunity, gastrointestinal health and stress resilience, emphasising the importance of personalised nutritional interventions in welfare improvement. Additionally, there are encouraging prospects to improve quail welfare thanks to genetic developments. Results are starting to emerge from selective breeding initiatives designed to increase stress tolerance, disease resistance and environmental adaptation. The potential of genetics and biotechnology in developing quail strains that are resilient to welfare challenges and highly productive is covered in this review. This review highlights the potential of integrating environmental enrichment, precision nutrition and genetic innovations to enhance quail welfare in intensive systems. These science-based strategies improve bird well-being and productivity, responding to growing consumer demand for ethically produced animal products.

This review highlights how precision nutrition improves poultry performance through metabolomics, which is a multidisciplinary approach that integrates traditional nutrition with other fields, including biology, immunology, molecular biology, genetics, computer sciences, chemistry, biochemistry, mathematics, engineering, and technology sciences. For measuring the results of the body's biochemical activities and figuring out Living systems' dynamic, multi-parametric metabolic response to pathological stimuli, metabolomics can be a very useful instrument. Numerous metabolomics techniques exist, including emerging capillary electrophoresis (CE), gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and some targeted HPLC-based assays. Metabolomics can help in understanding the metabolism of diets (protein, carbohydrate, and fat) and the pathways of precise nutrition. Metabolomics can revolutionize poultry nutrition strategies, optimizing health, growth performance, and metabolic efficiency by decoding biochemical interactions between diet, metabolism, and physiology.

Bacterial flagellin, a key microbe-associated molecular pattern, is recognized by Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) and NOD-like receptor family caspase activation and recruitment domain-containing 4 inflammasome. This dual recognition maintains the delicate balance between immune tolerance and activation, thereby influencing health and disease outcomes. Therefore, we explored the structural and functional evolution of bacterial flagellin to elucidate its role in innate and adaptive immune responses, along with its impact on metabolic processes, particularly via TLR5. In this review, we highlight the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of flagellin, including its application in vaccine development, cancer immunotherapy, and microbiome-based therapies. We integrated perspectives from structural biology, immunology, and microbiome research to elucidate the co-evolutionary dynamics between gut microbiota-derived flagellin and host immunity.

However, the design and application of whole-cell biosensing systems are limited by the unsatisfactory performance of the core sensing element ─ transcription factors. This paper proposed the development of artificial riboswitches for heavy metal identification based on their high sensitivity, specificity, and ease of modification, which can be used alone or combination with transcription factors to construct more efficient whole-cell biosensors. This article summarized the reported aptamers targeting heavy metals in the last 20 years, and presented methods for screening intracellularly folding aptamers and strategies for constructing and optimizing the performance of artificial riboswitches using these aptamers. Heavy-metal-induced artificial riboswitches can be used in multiple applications, significantly enhancing the design potential of whole-cell sensing systems.

Advances in deep phenotyping technologies, digital tools and artificial intelligence have made possible early proof-of-concept research that expands the understanding of within- and between-person variability in responses to diet. These studies illustrate the promise of precision nutrition to complement the traditional 'one size fits all' dietary guidelines, which, while considering broad life-stage and disease-specific nutritional requirements, often lack the granularity to account fully for individual variations in nutritional needs and dietary responses. Despite these developments, however, considerable challenges remain before precision nutrition can be implemented on a broader scale.

FAM implies using food as a part of an individual's health plan to prevent or help treat acute and chronic health conditions and diseases. We highlight trends and hurdles in the FAM intervention pyramid. Our viewpoint is to indicate how interventions might change the future demand for specific food groups, their transport in supply chains, and the technologies used to process them. On the basis of national guidelines, dietary interventions can help to prevent and treat many diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancers, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. FAM R&D and services offer more individualized treatments. This is challenging given the interindividual variability and complexity of the body's response to food and related factors, such as dietary habits, genetics, lifestyle, and biosphere. Quantifying health improvements is essential to prove the added value of more individualized FAM interventions compared with adopting a general healthy diet. It is unclear which level of individualization of interventions produces the largest health benefits at the lowest costs for the patient, healthcare system, and climate. FAM interventions can support and complement conventional medical treatment. They will require a shift to producing more health-promoting foods, including whole foods, minimally processed foods, and selected processed foods.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are emerging as critical tools in precision obesity management. miRNAs serve as biomarkers for predicting dietary response and obesity risk, while siRNAs provide a targeted approach to silencing obesity-related genes. This review explores the mechanisms, applications, and potential of integrating miRNA and siRNA in personalized dietary strategies to combat obesity. A comprehensive literature review was conducted using Boolean operations to identify studies on miRNAs, siRNAs, and their roles in precision nutrition. The review focused on molecular mechanisms, clinical applications, challenges, and future directions in integrating miRNA detection and siRNA therapy for obesity management. miRNAs regulate gene expression related to lipid metabolism, adipogenesis, and insulin sensitivity, with miRNA-33 and miRNA-103/107 being notable examples. siRNAs offer precise gene silencing for targets like SREBP-1c and PPARγ, addressing metabolic pathways resistant to dietary interventions. The synergistic integration of miRNAs as biomarkers and siRNAs as therapeutic tools enhances the personalization and efficacy of obesity management. The dual application of miRNAs and siRNAs in precision nutrition represents a transformative approach to obesity management.

Available evidence is organized according to the major classes of polyphenols (flavonoids, phenolic acids, stilbenes, lignans, and tannins) and their derived subgroups. Nutrigenetic studies have identified mainly single nucleotide polymorphisms located within genes involved in the biotransformation of phenolic acids, stilbenes, lignans and several flavonoid molecules. These genetic variants may affect polyphenol metabolism rates and related predisposition to chronic non-communicable diseases. Moreover, differential cardiometabolic outcomes upon polyphenol supplementation as dietary sources or nutraceuticals have been modulated by specific genotypes. Although current evidence is still limited, growing gene-polyphenol interactions are contributing to systematically elucidate the biological functions of polyphenols; determine individual risk phenotypes to specific diseases or particular responses upon polyphenol exposure; and facilitate the prescription of personalized genotype-based doses of dietary polyphenols to optimize related health benefits.

Determinants may include genetics, current dietary habits and eating patterns, circadian rhythms, health status, gut microbiome, socioeconomic and psychosocial characteristics, and physical activity. ​​​​In this systematic review, we examined the evidence base for the effect of interventions based on precision nutrition approaches on overweight and obesity in children and adolescents to help inform future research and global guidelines. To examine the impact of precision nutrition-based interventions for the management of obesity in children and adolescents in all their diversity. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science Core Collection, BIOSIS Previews, Global Index Medicus (all regions), IBECS, SciELO, PAHO, PAHO IRIS, WHO IRIS, WHOLIS, Bibliomap, and TRoPHI, as well as the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov. We last searched the databases on 23 July 2024. We did not apply any language restrictions. We included randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that evaluated precision nutrition-based interventions (accounting for 'omics' such as phenotyping, genotyping, gut microbiome; clinical data, baseline dietary intake, postprandial glucose response, etc., and/or including artificial intelligence such as machine learning methods) compared to general or one-size-fits-all interventions or no intervention in children and adolescents aged 0 to 9 years or 10 to 19 years with overweight or obesity. Two review authors independently conducted study screening, data extraction, and risk of bias and GRADE assessments. We used fixed-effect analyses. Our outcomes of interest were physical and mental well-being, physical activity, health-related quality of life, obesity-associated disability, and adverse events associated with the interventions as defined or measured by trialists, and weight change (reduction, stabilisation or maintenance). Two studies (3 references, 105 participants) conducted in Ukraine and Greece met our eligibility criteria. One study reported nonprofit funding sources, whilst the other did not report funding, and the certainty of evidence ranged from very low to low across outcomes (all measured at endpoint). Only one trial (65 participants) contributed data on our primary outcomes of interest. Precision nutrition-based intervention versus one-size-fits-all intervention or standard of care In children 0 to 9 years of age, evidence is very uncertain about the effect of a precision nutrition-based intervention (a computerised Decision Support Tool (DST) that incorporates a variety of participant data and provides personalised diet recommendations based on decision-tree algorithms) on body mass index (BMI) (mean difference (MD) -1.40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.48 to 0.68; 1 study, 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and on weight (MD -2.60 kg, 95% CI -8.42 to 3.22; 1 study, 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence) compared with a one-size-fits-all control intervention. In children and adolescents 10 to 19 years of age, evidence is very uncertain about the effect of a precision nutrition-based intervention (computerised DST) on BMI (MD 3.00 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95% CI -0.26 to 6.26; 1 study, 30 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and on weight (MD 11.40 kg, 95% CI -0.47 to 23.27; 1 study, 30 participants; very low-certainty evidence) compared with a one-size-fits-all control intervention. Based on data from two small studies with a total of 105 participants, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of precision nutrition-based interventions on body weight or BMI. This review was limited by the number of available randomised controlled trials in this relatively nascent field. Given these limitations, the two studies do not provide sufficient evidence to adequately inform practice. Future research should report participant outcome data, including outcomes related to mental, emotional, and functional well-being, in addition to biochemical and physical measures, stratified by World Health Organization-defined age groups (children (0 to 9 years), and children and adolescents (10 to 19 years)).

39861372,Vitamin Metabolism and Its Dependency on Genetic Variations Among Healthy Adults: A Systematic Review for Precision Nutrition Strategies.,"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in precision nutrition and its potential for disease prevention. Differences in individual responses to diet, especially among populations of different ancestry, have underlined the importance of understanding the effects of genetic variations on nutrient intake (nutrigenomics). Since humans generally cannot synthesize essential vitamins, the maintenance of healthy bodily functions depends on dietary vitamin intake. Understanding the differences in vitamin uptake and metabolism across diverse populations may allow for targeted treatment plans and improved overall health. We assessed the current scientific evidence on genetic variations (such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) affecting vitamin metabolism in humans. A systematic literature review of primary studies on genetic variations associated with (personalized) nutrition was conducted. Using key terms related to personalized nutrition, nutrigenomics, SNPs, and genetic variations, three online databases were searched for studies published between 2007 and 2023 that included healthy adult subjects. Only results that were confirmed at least once were included. Study quality was assessed with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool. Eighty-six articles were included in this review. Our analysis revealed associations with homocysteine metabolism and B Vitamins, Vitamin D, and components of Vitamin E. Genetic associations with Vitamin D, particularly with the GC gene, were extensively researched and linked to lower 25(OH)D concentrations, with sunlight exposure as a contributing factor. Most variants had a negative effect on homocysteine levels. Additionally, we observed general increases in carotenoid levels in the presence of SNPs, although more research on Selenium and Selenoprotein P concentrations is warranted. No studies on Vitamin C were obtained, indicating an area for further methodological improvement. Ancestry is believed to be a significant factor influencing SNP associations and significance. The current review emphasizes the importance of genetics in targeted disease prevention and health care. Our comprehensive findings may provide healthcare practitioners with reliable information to make recommendations in precision nutrition, specifically vitamin supplementation.",Bösch ES; Spörri J; Scherr J,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39861372/,0,1,0,0,0,0
39796537,The Contribution of Precision Nutrition Intervention in Subfertile Couples.,"Subfertility is characterized by a decrease in reproductive efficiency, which can result in delayed pregnancy, and affects one in six individuals during their lifetime. The present narrative review aims to evaluate the contribution of precision nutrition to changes in fertility in subfertile couples. The literature review was carried out through bibliographic research in the PubMed, Scopus, SciELO and Google Scholar databases. The following search criteria were applied: (1) original articles and narrative, systematic or meta-analytic reviews, and (2) the individual or combined use of the following keywords: ""genetic variation"", ""nutrigenetics"", ""precision nutrition"", ""couple's subfertility"", and ""couple's infertility"". A preliminary reading of all the articles was carried out, and only those that best fit the themes and subthemes of the narrative review were selected. Scientific evidence suggests that adherence to a healthy diet that follows the Mediterranean pattern is associated with increased fertility in women and improved semen quality in men, better metabolic health and reduced levels of inflammation and oxidative stress, as well as maintaining a healthy body weight. The integration of different tools, such as nutrigenetics, predictive biochemical analyses, intestinal microbiota tests and clinical nutrition software, used in precision nutrition interventions can contribute to providing information on how diet and genetics interact and how they can influence fertility.

39796476,Emerging Biomarkers and Determinants of Lipoprotein Profiles to Predict CVD Risk: Implications for Precision Nutrition.,"Biomarkers constitute a valuable tool to diagnose both the incidence and the prevalence of chronic diseases and may help to inform the design and effectiveness of precision nutrition interventions. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be the foremost cause of death all over the world. While the reasons that lead to increased risk for CVD are multifactorial, dyslipidemias, plasma concentrations of specific lipoproteins, and dynamic measures of lipoprotein function are strong biomarkers to predict and document coronary heart disease incidence. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the biomarkers and emerging approaches that can be utilized to characterize lipoprotein profiles as predictive tools for assessing CVD risk, including the assessment of traditional clinical lipid panels, measures of lipoprotein efflux capacity and inflammatory and antioxidant activity, and omics-based characterization of lipoprotein composition and regulators of lipoprotein metabolism. In addition, we discuss demographic, genetic, metagenomic, and lifestyle determinants of lipoprotein profiles-such as age, sex, gene variants and single-nucleotide polymorphisms, gut microbiome profiles, dietary patterns, physical inactivity, obesity status, smoking and alcohol intake, and stress-which are likely to be essential factors to explain interindividual responses to precision nutrition recommendations to mitigate CVD risk.",Andersen CJ; Fernandez ML,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39796476/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39683519,Nutritional Genomics: Implications for Age-Related Macular Degeneration.,"<b>Background:</b> Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss in older individuals, driven by a multifactorial etiology involving genetic, environmental, and dietary factors. Nutritional genomics, which studies gene-nutrient interactions, has emerged as a promising field for AMD prevention and management. Genetic predispositions, such as variants in <i>CFH</i>, <i>C3</i>, <i>C2/CFB</i>, <i>APOE</i>, and oxidative stress pathways, significantly affect the risk and progression of AMD. <b>Methods:</b> This narrative review synthesizes findings from randomized controlled trials and recent advances in nutritional genomics research. It examines the interplay between genetic predispositions and dietary interventions, exploring how personalized nutritional strategies can optimize AMD management. <b>Results and Discussion:</b> The AREDS and AREDS2 trials demonstrated that supplements, including vitamins C, E, zinc, copper, lutein, and zeaxanthin, can reduce the progression to advanced AMD. Nutritional interventions tailored to genetic profiles show promise: <i>CFH</i> risk alleles may enhance zinc supplementation's anti-inflammatory effects, while <i>APOE</i> variants influence the response to omega-3 fatty acids. Adjusting carotenoid intake, such as lutein and zeaxanthin, based on genetic susceptibility exemplifies emerging precision nutritional approaches. Ongoing research seeks to integrate nutrigenomic testing into clinical settings, enabling clinicians to tailor interventions to individual genetic profiles. <b>Conclusions:</b> Further studies are needed to assess the long-term effects of personalized interventions, investigate additional genetic variants, and develop tools for clinical implementation of nutrigenomics. Advancing these strategies holds the potential to improve patient outcomes, optimize AMD management, and pave the way for precision nutrition in ophthalmology.",Figueiredo I; Farinha C; Barreto P; Coimbra R; Pereira P; Marques JP; Pires I; Cachulo ML; Silva R,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39683519/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39663494,π-HuB: the proteomic navigator of the human body.,"The human body contains trillions of cells, classified into specific cell types, with diverse morphologies and functions. In addition, cells of the same type can assume different states within an individual's body during their lifetime. Understanding the complexities of the proteome in the context of a human organism and its many potential states is a necessary requirement to understanding human biology, but these complexities can neither be predicted from the genome, nor have they been systematically measurable with available technologies. Recent advances in proteomic technology and computational sciences now provide opportunities to investigate the intricate biology of the human body at unprecedented resolution and scale. Here we introduce a big-science endeavour called π-HuB (proteomic navigator of the human body). The aim of the π-HuB project is to (1) generate and harness multimodality proteomic datasets to enhance our understanding of human biology; (2) facilitate disease risk assessment and diagnosis; (3) uncover new drug targets; (4) optimize appropriate therapeutic strategies; and (5) enable intelligent healthcare, thereby ushering in a new era of proteomics-driven phronesis medicine.

39519563,Coffee and Risk of Pancreatic Cancer: Insights from Two-Sample and Multivariable Mendelian Randomization Analyses.,"The association between coffee and pancreatic cancer risk has reported inconsistent results. Therefore, a Mendelian randomization (MR) study was undertaken to investigate the association between coffee and pancreatic cancer from a genetic perspective. In East Asian and European populations, independent genetic variants strongly associated with coffee were chosen as instrumental variables (IVs) from relevant genome-wide association studies (GWASs). GWAS data for pancreatic cancer were obtained from the JENGER (Japanese Encyclopedia of Genetic Associations by Riken) project and GWAS catalog database. Two-sample (TSMR) and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) analyses were conducted to investigate the genetically predicted causal relationship between coffee consumption and pancreatic cancer. A fixed-effect meta-analysis was employed to aggregate estimates from the two populations to reveal the overall association. Both in East Asian and European populations, an increase in coffee intake of a cup per day was not associated with pancreatic cancer risk, regardless of coffee type (including caffeine drinks, instant coffee, decaffeinated coffee, ground coffee, etc.). The results aligned with the findings of the meta-analysis (OR = 1.100, 95%CI = 0.862-1.403, <i>p</i> = 0.450). Also, for coffee intake with positive results in the TSMR analysis (OR = 1.739, 95%CI 1.104-2.739, <i>p</i> = 0.017), consistent negative results were observed after adjusting for potential confounders (smoking traits, drinking, type 2 diabetes, body mass index) in the MVMR analyses.

39481358,"DNA Methylation and Non-Coding RNAs in Metabolic Disorders: Epigenetic Role of Nutrients, Dietary Patterns, and Weight Loss Interventions for Precision Nutrition.","Dysregulation of epigenetic processes and abnormal epigenetic profiles are associated with various metabolic disorders. Nutrition, as an environmental factor, can induce epigenetic changes through both direct exposure and transgenerational inheritance, continuously altering gene expression and shaping the phenotype. Nutrients consumed through food or supplementation, such as vitamin B12, folate, vitamin B6, and choline, play a pivotal role in DNA methylation, a critical process for gene regulation. Additionally, there is mounting evidence that the expression of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) can be modulated by the intake of specific nutrients and natural compounds, thereby influencing processes involved in the onset and progression of metabolic diseases. Evidence suggests that dietary patterns, weight loss interventions, nutrients and nutritional bioactive compounds can modulate the expression of various microRNA (miRNAs) and DNA methylation levels, contributing to the development of metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, several studies have proposed that DNA methylation and miRNA expression could serve as biomarkers for the effects of weight loss programs. Despite ongoing debate regarding the effects of nutrient supplementation on DNA methylation levels and the expression of ncRNAs, certain DNA methylation marks and ncRNA expressions might predict the risk of metabolic disorders and act as biomarkers for forecasting the success of therapies within the framework of precision medicine and nutrition. The role of DNA methylation and miRNA expression as potential mediators of the effects of weight loss underscores their potential as biomarkers for the outcomes of weight loss programs. This highlights the influence of dietary patterns and weight loss interventions on the regulation of miRNA expression and DNA methylation levels, suggesting an interaction between these epigenetic factors and the body's response to weight loss.",Nicoletti CF; Assmann TS; Souza LL; Martinez JA,Lifestyle genomics,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39481358/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39467522,Barriers in Translating Existing Nutrigenetics Insights to Precision Nutrition for Cardiometabolic Health in Ethnically Diverse Populations.,"Cardiometabolic diseases pose a significant threat to global public health, with a substantial majority of cardiovascular disease mortality (more than three-quarters) occurring in low- and middle-income countries. There have been remarkable advances in recent years in identifying genetic variants that alter disease susceptibility by interacting with dietary factors. Despite the remarkable progress, several factors need to be considered before the translation of nutrigenetics insights to personalised and precision nutrition in ethnically diverse populations. Some of these factors include variations in genetic predispositions, cultural and lifestyle factors as well as socio-economic factors. This review aimed to explore the factors that need to be considered in bridging the gap between existing nutrigenetics insights and the implementation of personalised and precision nutrition across diverse ethnicities. Several factors might influence variations among individuals with regard to dietary exposures and metabolic responses, and these include genetic diversity, cultural and lifestyle factors as well as socio-economic factors. A multi-omics approach involving disciplines such as metabolomics, epigenetics, and the gut microbiome might contribute to improved understanding of the underlying mechanisms of gene-diet interactions and the implementation of precision nutrition although more research is needed to confirm the practicality and effectiveness of this approach. Conducting gene-diet interaction studies in diverse populations is essential and studies utilising large sample sizes are required as this improves the power to detect interactions with minimal effect sizes. Future studies should focus on replicating initial findings to enhance reliability and promote comparison across studies. Once findings have been replicated in independent samples, dietary intervention studies will be required to further strengthen the evidence and facilitate their application in clinical practice. Nutrigenetics has a potential role to play in the prevention and management of cardiometabolic diseases. Conducting gene-diet interaction studies in diverse populations is essential giving the genetic diversity and variations in dietary patterns. Integrating data from disciplines such as metabolomics, epigenetics, and the gut microbiome could help in early identification of individuals at risk of cardiometabolic diseases as well as the implementation of precise dietary interventions for preventing and managing cardiometabolic diseases.",Wuni R; Vimaleswaran KS,Lifestyle genomics,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39467522/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39418223,Gut microbiota determines the fate of dietary fiber-targeted interventions in host health.,"Epidemiological investigation confirmed that the intake of dietary fiber (DF) is closely related to human health, and the most important factor affecting the physiological function of DF, besides its physicochemical properties, is the gut microbiota. This paper mainly summarizes the interaction between DF and gut microbiota, including the influence of DF on the colonization of gut microbiota based on its different physicochemical properties, and the physiological role of gut microbiota in destroying the complex molecular structure of DF by encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes, thus producing small molecular products that affect the metabolism of the host. Taking cardiovascular disease (Atherosclerosis and hypertension), liver disease, and immune diseases as examples, it is confirmed that some DF, such as fructo-oligosaccharide, galactooligosaccharide, xylo-oligosaccharide, and inulin, have prebiotic-like physiological effects. These effects are dependent on the metabolites produced by the gut microbiota. Therefore, this paper further explores how DF affects the gut microbiota's production of substances such as short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, and tryptophan metabolites, and provides a preliminary explanation of the mechanisms associated with their impact on host health. Finally, based on the structural properties of DF and the large heterogeneity in the composition of the population gut microbiota, it may be a future trend to utilize DF and the gut microbiota to correlate host health for precision nutrition by combining the information from population disease databases.",Wang W; Fan Z; Yan Q; Pan T; Luo J; Wei Y; Li B; Fang Z; Lu W,Gut microbes,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39418223/,1,0,0,0,0,0

However, the mechanisms by which these microorganisms contribute to cancer development are complex and far from completely clarified. Specifically, the impact of gut microbiota-derived metabolites on CRC is undeniable, exerting both protective and detrimental effects. This paper examines the effects and mechanisms by which important bacterial metabolites exert detrimental effects associated with increased risk of CRC. Metabolites considered include heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heme iron, secondary bile acids, ethanol, and aromatic amines. It is necessary to delve deeper into the mechanisms of action of these metabolites in CRC and identify the microbiota members involved in their production. Furthermore, since diet is the main factor capable of modifying the intestinal microbiota, conducting studies that include detailed descriptions of dietary interventions is crucial. All this knowledge is essential for developing precision nutrition strategies to optimise a protective intestinal microbiota against CRC.",González A; Fullaondo A; Odriozola I; Odriozola A,Advances in genetics,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39396839/,1,0,0,0,0,0
39283705,A Systematic Review of the Effect of Gene-Lifestyle Interactions on Metabolic-Disease-Related Traits in South Asian Populations.,"Recent data from the South Asian subregion have raised concern about the dramatic increase in the prevalence of metabolic diseases, which are influenced by genetic and lifestyle factors. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the contemporary evidence for the effect of gene-lifestyle interactions on metabolic outcomes in this population. PubMed, Web of Science, and SCOPUS databases were searched up until March 2023 for observational and intervention studies investigating the interaction between genetic variants and lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity on obesity and type 2 diabetes traits. Of the 14 783 publications extracted, 15 were deemed eligible for inclusion in this study. Data extraction was carried out independently by 3 investigators. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Appraisal Tool for Cross-Sectional Studies (AXIS), the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I), and the methodological quality score for nutrigenetics studies. Using a narrative synthesis approach, the findings were presented in textual and tabular format. Together, studies from India (n = 8), Pakistan (n = 3), Sri Lanka (n = 1), and the South Asian diaspora in Singapore and Canada (n = 3) reported 543 gene-lifestyle interactions, of which 132 (∼24%) were statistically significant. These results were related to the effects of the interaction of genetic factors with physical inactivity, poor sleep habits, smoking, and dietary intake of carbohydrates, protein, and fat on the risk of metabolic disease in this population. The findings of this systematic review provide evidence of gene-lifestyle interactions impacting metabolic traits within the South Asian population. However, the lack of replication and correction for multiple testing and the small sample size of the included studies may limit the conclusiveness of the evidence.

39164015,Nutrigenetics and Nutritional Strategies in Systemic Arterial Hypertension: Evidence From a Scoping Review.,"Nutrition and genetics have individual roles in systemic arterial hypertension (SAH); however, they can interact, influencing the regulation of blood pressure (BP) levels. The aim of this study was to evaluate the available evidence regarding gene-nutrient interactions in modulating BP levels in adults with SAH. The review followed the recommendations of the Joanna Briggs Institute and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, reporting on 20 genes and 31 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), with 19 of them associated with BP variations. The most frequently evaluated SNPs were ACE rs4646994 and AT1R rs5186. Among the nutritional interventions, dietary sodium content was the focus of most studies (n = 11). Interactions with sodium consumption were observed for the following SNPs: KDM1A rs587168, EDNRB rs5351, LSS rs2254524, IRS1 rs1801278, KCNK9 rs6997709, ACE rs4646994, GNB3 rs5443, PPARG rs4684847, EDN1 rs5370, BCAT1 rs7961152, IL18 rs5744292, NOS3 rs2070744, and AT1R rs5186. In the presence of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, moderate alcohol consumption, and reduced sodium intake, the SNP AT2R rs11091046 was associated with a decrease in BP levels. Furthermore, the SNP MTHFR rs1801133 exhibited an interaction with riboflavin supplementation in affecting BP levels. The evidence regarding the interaction between genetics and diet on BP levels remains limited. Among the existing findings, an interaction was observed between sodium, calcium, riboflavin, and specific polymorphisms; however, the underlying mechanisms for these interactions have yet to be identified.

39097171,Dietary modulation of microRNAs in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.,"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing worldwide. Various molecular mechanisms have been proposed to interfere with the insulin signaling pathway. Recent advances in proteomics and genomics indicate that one such mechanism involves the post-transcriptional regulation of insulin signaling by microRNA (miRNA). These noncoding RNAs typically induce messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation or translational repression by interacting with the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of target mRNA. Dietary components and patterns, which can either enhance or impair the insulin signaling pathway, have been found to regulate miRNA expression in both in vitro and in vivo studies. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge of how dietary components influence the expression of miRNAs related to the control of the insulin signaling pathway and discusses the potential application of these findings in precision nutrition.",Capetini VC; Quintanilha BJ; Garcia BREV; Rogero MM,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39097171/,1,0,0,0,0,0

The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to explore the association between the different genotypes of MC4R rs17782313 and energy intake and appetite. A literature search was conducted up to June 2023 in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Collaboration databases, following PRISMA guidelines. Inclusion criteria were studies in humans measuring energy intake, appetite, or satiety in all ages and physiological conditions. Studies dealing solely with body mass index were excluded. Twenty-one articles representing 48 560 participants were included in the meta-analysis. According to the NHLBI (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute) quality-assessment criteria, all case-control studies and 6 out of 17 cohort and cross-sectional studies were classified as ""good,"" while the rest scored as ""fair."" Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated in a (CT+CC) vs TT dominant model, and both random-effects and fixed-effects models were used. A statistically significant association between the presence of the C allele and increased appetite was found (OR = 1.25; 95% CI: 1.01-1.49; P = .038) using the fixed-effects model, but the random-effects model proved nonsignificant. However, no association with energy intake was found. None of the variables considered (sample size, year of publication, sex, age group, type of population, origin, and quality) were identified as effect modifiers, and no publication biases were found after subgroup and meta-regression analyses. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis that has analyzed the association between rs17782313 of MC4R and energy intake and appetite.

Genetics may account for differences in CAP tolerance and its impact on adiposity status. The aim of this study was to systematically review current evidence concerning the role of genetic polymorphisms influencing CAP tolerance. The present systematic review analyzed and synthesized available evidence concerning associations between genetic polymorphisms and CAP tolerance following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines.

38785965,"Biological Rhythms, Chrono-Nutrition, and Gut Microbiota: Epigenomics Insights for Precision Nutrition and Metabolic Health.","Circadian rhythms integrate a finely tuned network of biological processes recurring every 24 h, intricately coordinating the machinery of all cells. This self-regulating system plays a pivotal role in synchronizing physiological and behavioral responses, ensuring an adaptive metabolism within the environmental milieu, including dietary and physical activity habits. The systemic integration of circadian homeostasis involves a balance of biological rhythms, each synchronically linked to the central circadian clock. Central to this orchestration is the temporal dimension of nutrient and food intake, an aspect closely interwoven with the neuroendocrine circuit, gut physiology, and resident microbiota. Indeed, the timing of meals exerts a profound influence on cell cycle regulation through genomic and epigenetic processes, particularly those involving gene expression, DNA methylation and repair, and non-coding RNA activity. These (epi)genomic interactions involve a dynamic interface between circadian rhythms, nutrition, and the gut microbiota, shaping the metabolic and immune landscape of the host. This research endeavors to illustrate the intricate (epi)genetic interplay that modulates the synchronization of circadian rhythms, nutritional signaling, and the gut microbiota, unravelling the repercussions on metabolic health while suggesting the potential benefits of feed circadian realignment as a non-invasive therapeutic strategy for systemic metabolic modulation via gut microbiota.

38728013,Conjugated linoleic acid metabolite impact in colorectal cancer: a potential microbiome-based precision nutrition approach.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most deadly and the third most diagnosed cancer in both sexes worldwide. CRC pathogenesis is associated with risk factors such as genetics, alcohol, smoking, sedentariness, obesity, unbalanced diets, and gut microbiota dysbiosis. The gut microbiota is the microbial community living in symbiosis in the intestine, in a dynamic balance vital for health. Increasing evidence underscores the influence of specific gut microbiota bacterial species on CRC incidence and pathogenesis. In this regard, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) metabolites produced by certain gut microbiota have demonstrated an anticarcinogenic effect in CRC, influencing pathways for inflammation, proliferation, and apoptosis. CLA production occurs naturally in the rumen, and human bioavailability is through the consumption of food derived from ruminants. In recent years, biotechnological attempts to increase CLA bioavailability in humans have been unfruitful. Therefore, the conversion of essential dietary linoleic acid to CLA metabolite by specific intestinal bacteria has become a promising process. This article reviews the evidence regarding CLA and CLA-producing bacteria as therapeutic agents against CRC and investigates the best strategy for increasing the yield and bioavailability of CLA. Given the potential and limitations of the present strategies, a new microbiome-based precision nutrition approach based on endogenous CLA production by human gut bacteria is proposed. A literature search in the PubMed and PubMed Central databases identified 794 papers on human gut bacteria associated with CLA production. Of these, 51 studies exploring association consistency were selected. After excluding 19 papers, due to health concerns or discrepancies between studies, 32 papers were selected for analysis, encompassing data for 38 CLA-producing bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species. The information was analyzed by a bioinformatics food recommendation system patented by our research group, Phymofood (EP22382095).

These digital tools have been designed for particular user groups: citizens, nutritionists, and physicians and researchers employing genetics and epigenetics tools. The applications were evaluated in terms of their key functionalities, strengths, and limitations. The analysis primarily concentrated on artificial intelligence algorithms and devices intended to streamline the collection and organization of nutrition data. Furthermore, an exploration was conducted of potential future advancements in this field. Digital applications designed for the use of citizens allow diet self-monitoring, and they can be an effective tool for weight and diabetes management, while digital precision nutrition solutions for professionals can provide scalability, personalized recommendations for patients, and a means of providing ongoing diet support. The limitations in using these digital applications include data accuracy, accessibility, and affordability, and further research and development are required. The integration of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and blockchain technology holds promise for improving the performance, security, and privacy of digital precision nutrition interventions. Multidisciplinarity is crucial for evidence-based and accessible solutions. Digital applications for diet monitoring and precision nutrition have the potential to revolutionize nutrition and health. These tools can make it easier for individuals to control their diets, help nutritionists provide better care, and enable physicians to offer personalized treatment.",Abeltino A; Riente A; Bianchetti G; Serantoni C; De Spirito M; Capezzone S; Esposito R; Maulucci G,Nutrition reviews,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38722240/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38586455,Meal timing and its role in obesity and associated diseases.,"Meal timing emerges as a crucial factor influencing metabolic health that can be explained by the tight interaction between the endogenous circadian clock and metabolic homeostasis. Mistimed food intake, such as delayed or nighttime consumption, leads to desynchronization of the internal circadian clock and is associated with an increased risk for obesity and associated metabolic disturbances such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Conversely, meal timing aligned with cellular rhythms can optimize the performance of tissues and organs. In this review, we provide an overview of the metabolic effects of meal timing and discuss the underlying mechanisms. Additionally, we explore factors influencing meal timing, including internal determinants such as chronotype and genetics, as well as external influences like social factors, cultural aspects, and work schedules. This review could contribute to defining meal-timing-based recommendations for public health initiatives and developing guidelines for effective lifestyle modifications targeting the prevention and treatment of obesity and associated metabolic diseases. Furthermore, it sheds light on crucial factors that must be considered in the design of future food timing intervention trials.",Peters B; Vahlhaus J; Pivovarova-Ramich O,Frontiers in endocrinology,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38586455/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38474710,"Precision Nutrition Unveiled: Gene-Nutrient Interactions, Microbiota Dynamics, and Lifestyle Factors in Obesity Management.","Obesity is a complex metabolic disorder that is associated with several diseases. Recently, precision nutrition (PN) has emerged as a tailored approach to provide individualised dietary recommendations. This review discusses the major intrinsic and extrinsic components considered when applying PN during the management of obesity and common associated chronic conditions. The review identified three main PN components: gene-nutrient interactions, intestinal microbiota, and lifestyle factors. Genetic makeup significantly contributes to inter-individual variations in dietary behaviours, with advanced genome sequencing and population genetics aiding in detecting gene variants associated with obesity. Additionally, PN-based host-microbiota evaluation emerges as an advanced therapeutic tool, impacting disease control and prevention. The gut microbiome's composition regulates diverse responses to nutritional recommendations. Several studies highlight PN's effectiveness in improving diet quality and enhancing adherence to physical activity among obese patients. PN is a key strategy for addressing obesity-related risk factors, encompassing dietary patterns, body weight, fat, blood lipids, glucose levels, and insulin resistance. PN stands out as a feasible tool for effectively managing obesity, considering its ability to integrate genetic and lifestyle factors. The application of PN-based approaches not only improves current obesity conditions but also holds promise for preventing obesity and its associated complications in the long term.",Mansour S; Alkhaaldi SMI; Sammanasunathan AF; Ibrahim S; Farhat J; Al-Omari B,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38474710/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38442341,Understanding and applying gene-environment interactions: a guide for nutrition professionals with an emphasis on integration in African research settings.,"Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are influenced by the interplay between genetics and environmental exposures, particularly diet. However, many healthcare professionals, including nutritionists and dietitians, have limited genetic background and, therefore, they may lack understanding of gene-environment interactions (GxEs) studies. Even researchers deeply involved in nutrition studies, but with a focus elsewhere, can struggle to interpret, evaluate, and conduct GxE studies. There is an urgent need to study African populations that bear a heavy burden of NCDs, demonstrate unique genetic variability, and have cultural practices resulting in distinctive environmental exposures compared with Europeans or Americans, who are studied more. Although diverse and rapidly changing environments, as well as the high genetic variability of Africans and difference in linkage disequilibrium (ie, certain gene variants are inherited together more often than expected by chance), provide unparalleled potential to investigate the omics fields, only a small percentage of studies come from Africa. Furthermore, research evidence lags behind the practices of companies offering genetic testing for personalized medicine and nutrition. We need to generate more evidence on GxEs that also considers continental African populations to be able to prevent unethical practices and enable tailored treatments. This review aims to introduce nutrition professionals to genetics terms and valid methods to investigate GxEs and their challenges, and proposes ways to improve quality and reproducibility. The review also provides insight into the potential contributions of nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics to the healthcare sphere, addresses direct-to-consumer genetic testing, and concludes by offering insights into the field's future, including advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning.",Nienaber-Rousseau C,Nutrition reviews,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38442341/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Focusing on macronutrient tailoring, we discuss the impact of genetic variation on responses to carbohydrate, lipid, protein, and fiber consumption. Our bioinformatic analysis of genomic variants guiding macronutrient intake revealed enrichment of pathways associated with circadian rhythm, melatonin metabolism, cholesterol and lipoprotein remodeling and PPAR signaling as potential targets of macronutrients for the management of obesity in relevant genetic backgrounds. Notably, our data-based in silico predictions suggest the potential of repurposing the SYK inhibitor fostamatinib for obesity treatment in relevant genetic profiles. In addition to dietary considerations, we address genetic variations guiding lifestyle changes in weight management, including exercise and chrononutrition. Finally, we emphasize the need for a refined understanding and expanded research into the complex genetic landscape underlying obesity and its management.",Gkouskou KK; Grammatikopoulou MG; Lazou E; Vasilogiannakopoulou T; Sanoudou D; Eliopoulos AG,Human genomics,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38281958/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38276558,Cow's Milk: A Benefit for Human Health? Omics Tools and Precision Nutrition for Lactose Intolerance Management.,"Cow's milk (CM) is a healthy food consumed worldwide by individuals of all ages. Unfortunately, ""lactase-deficient"" individuals cannot digest milk's main carbohydrate, lactose, depriving themselves of highly beneficial milk proteins like casein, lactoalbumin, and lactoglobulin due to lactose intolerance (LI), while other individuals develop allergies specifically against these proteins (CMPA). The management of these conditions differs, and an inappropriate diagnosis or treatment may have significant implications for the patients, especially if they are infants or very young children, resulting in unnecessary dietary restrictions or avoidable adverse reactions. Omics technologies play a pivotal role in elucidating the intricate interactions between nutrients and the human body, spanning from genetic factors to the microbiota profile and metabolites. This comprehensive approach enables the precise delineation and identification of distinct cohorts of individuals with specific dietary requirements, so that tailored nutrition strategies can be developed. This is what is called personalized nutrition or precision nutrition (PN), the area of nutrition that focuses on the effects of nutrients on the genome, proteome, and metabolome, promoting well-being and health, preventing diseases, reducing chronic disease incidence, and increasing life expectancy. Here, we report the opinion of the scientific community proposing to replace the ""one size fits all"" approach with tailor-made nutrition programs, designed by integrating nutrigenomic data together with clinical parameters and microbiota profiles, taking into account the individual lactose tolerance threshold and needs in terms of specific nutrients intake. This customized approach could help LI patients to improve their quality of life, overcoming depression or anxiety often resulting from the individual perception of this condition as different from a normal state.",Pratelli G; Tamburini B; Badami GD; Lo Pizzo M; De Blasio A; Carlisi D; Di Liberto D,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38276558/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38219722,Application of Gut Bacterial Profiling Information in Precision Nutrition for Obesity and Weight Loss Management.,"It has been suggested that the dysfunction of the gut microbiome can have deleterious effects on the regulation of body weight and adiposity by affecting energy metabolism. In this context, gut bacterial profiling studies have contributed to characterize specific bacteria associated with obesity. This review covers the information driven by gut bacterial profiling analyses and emphasizes the potential application of this knowledge in precision nutrition strategies for obesity understanding and weight loss management. Gut bacterial profiling studies have identified bacterial families that are more abundant in obese than in nonobese individuals (i.e., Prevotellaeae, Ruminococcaceae, and Veillonellaceae) as well as other families that have been repeatedly found more abundant in nonobese people (i.e., Christensenellaceae and Coriobacteriaceae), suggesting that an increase in their relative amount could be an interesting target in weight-loss treatments. Also, some gut-derived metabolites have been related to the regulation of body weight, including short-chain fatty acids, trimethylamine-N-oxide, and branched-chain and aromatic amino acids. Moreover, gut microbiota profiles may play a role in determining weight loss responses to specific nutritional treatments for the precise management of obesity. Thus, incorporating gut microbiota features may improve the performance of integrative models to predict weight loss outcomes. The application of gut bacterial profiling information is of great value for precision nutrition in metabolic diseases since it contributes to the understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in obesity onset and progression, facilitates the identification of potential microorganism targets, and allows the personalization of tailored weight loss diets as well as the prediction of adiposity outcomes based on the gut bacterial profiling of each individual. Integrating microbiota information with other omics knowledge (genetics, epigenetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular and physiological events underlying obesity and adiposity outcomes for precision nutrition.",Ramos-Lopez O; Aranaz P; Riezu-Boj JI; Milagro FI,Lifestyle genomics,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38219722/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38143595,Beyond Diet and Exercise: The Impact of Gut Microbiota on Control of Obesity.,"Obesity, a widespread health concern characterized by the excessive accumulation of body fat, is a complex condition influenced by genetics, environment, and social determinants. Recent research has increasingly focused on the role of gut microbiota in obesity, highlighting its pivotal involvement in various metabolic processes. The gut microbiota, a diverse community of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, interacts with the host in a myriad of ways, impacting energy metabolism, appetite regulation, inflammation, and the gut-brain axis. Dietary choices significantly shape the gut microbiota, with diets high in fat and carbohydrates promoting the growth of harmful bacteria while reducing beneficial microbes. Lifestyle factors, like physical activity and smoking, also influence gut microbiota composition. Antibiotics and medications can disrupt microbial diversity, potentially contributing to obesity. Early-life experiences, including maternal obesity during pregnancy, play a vital role in the developmental origins of obesity. Therapeutic interventions targeting the gut microbiota, including prebiotics, probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, bacterial consortium therapy, and precision nutrition, offer promising avenues for reshaping the gut microbiota and positively influencing weight regulation and metabolic health. Clinical applications of microbiota-based therapies are on the horizon, with potential implications for personalized treatments and condition-based interventions. Emerging technologies, such as next-generation sequencing and advanced bioinformatics, empower researchers to identify specific target species for microbiota-based therapeutics, opening new possibilities in healthcare. Despite the promising outlook, microbiota-based therapies face challenges related to microbial selection, safety, and regulatory issues. However, with ongoing research and advances in the field, these challenges can be addressed to unlock the full potential of microbiota-based interventions.",Kamal FD; Dagar M; Reza T; Karim Mandokhail A; Bakht D; Shahzad MW; Silloca-Cabana EO; Mohsin SN; Chilla SP; Bokhari SFH,Cureus,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38143595/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Therefore, the combination of omics technologies with the use of phenolic compounds may represent a promising approach to precision nutrition in cancer. This article provides an updated review involving the current applications of high-throughput technologies in ovarian cancer, the role of dietary polyphenols and their mechanistic effects in ovarian cancer, and the current status and challenges of precision nutrition and their relationship with big data. High-throughput technologies in different omics science can provide relevant information from different facets for identifying biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and selection of specific therapies for personalized treatment. Furthermore, the field of omics sciences can provide a better understanding of the role of polyphenols and their function as signaling molecules in the prevention and treatment of ovarian cancer.

38075858,A toolbox of machine learning software to support microbiome analysis.,"The human microbiome has become an area of intense research due to its potential impact on human health. However, the analysis and interpretation of this data have proven to be challenging due to its complexity and high dimensionality. Machine learning (ML) algorithms can process vast amounts of data to uncover informative patterns and relationships within the data, even with limited prior knowledge. Therefore, there has been a rapid growth in the development of software specifically designed for the analysis and interpretation of microbiome data using ML techniques. These software incorporate a wide range of ML algorithms for clustering, classification, regression, or feature selection, to identify microbial patterns and relationships within the data and generate predictive models. This rapid development with a constant need for new developments and integration of new features require efforts into compile, catalog and classify these tools to create infrastructures and services with easy, transparent, and trustable standards. Here we review the state-of-the-art for ML tools applied in human microbiome studies, performed as part of the COST Action ML4Microbiome activities. This scoping review focuses on ML based software and framework resources currently available for the analysis of microbiome data in humans. The aim is to support microbiologists and biomedical scientists to go deeper into specialized resources that integrate ML techniques and facilitate future benchmarking to create standards for the analysis of microbiome data. The software resources are organized based on the type of analysis they were developed for and the ML techniques they implement. A description of each software with examples of usage is provided including comments about pitfalls and lacks in the usage of software based on ML methods in relation to microbiome data that need to be considered by developers and users. This review represents an extensive compilation to date, offering valuable insights and guidance for researchers interested in leveraging ML approaches for microbiome analysis.",Marcos-Zambrano LJ; López-Molina VM; Bakir-Gungor B; Frohme M; Karaduzovic-Hadziabdic K; Klammsteiner T; Ibrahimi E; Lahti L; Loncar-Turukalo T; Dhamo X; Simeon A; Nechyporenko A; Pio G; Przymus P; Sampri A; Trajkovik V; Lacruz-Pleguezuelos B; Aasmets O; Araujo R; Anagnostopoulos I; Aydemir Ö; Berland M; Calle ML; Ceci M; Duman H; Gündoğdu A; Havulinna AS; Kaka Bra KHN; Kalluci E; Karav S; Lode D; Lopes MB; May P; Nap B; Nedyalkova M; Paciência I; Pasic L; Pujolassos M; Shigdel R; Susín A; Thiele I; Truică CO; Wilmes P; Yilmaz E; Yousef M; Claesson MJ; Truu J; Carrillo de Santa Pau E,Frontiers in microbiology,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38075858/,1,0,0,0,0,0
38065232,Emerging roles of RNA ac4C modification and NAT10 in mammalian development and human diseases.,"RNA ac4C modification is a novel and rare chemical modification observed in mRNA. Traditional biochemical studies had primarily associated ac4C modification with tRNA and rRNA until in 2018, Arango D et al. first reported the presence of ac4C modification on mRNA and demonstrated its critical role in mRNA stability and translation regulation. Furthermore, they established that the ac4C modification on mRNA is mediated by the classical N-acetyltransferase NAT10. Subsequent studies have underscored the essential implications of NAT10 and mRNA ac4C modification across both physiological and pathological regulatory processes. In this review, we aimed to explore the discovery history of RNA ac4C modification, its detection methods, and its regulatory mechanisms in disease and physiological development. We offer a forward-looking examination and discourse concerning the employment of RNA ac4C modification as a prospective therapeutic strategy across diverse diseases. Furthermore, we comprehensively summarize the functions and mechanisms of NAT10 in gene expression regulation and pathogenesis independent of RNA ac4C modification.",Zhang Y; Lei Y; Dong Y; Chen S; Sun S; Zhou F; Zhao Z; Chen B; Wei L; Chen J; Meng Z,Pharmacology & therapeutics,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38065232/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37890592,Effects of DHA on cognitive dysfunction in aging and Alzheimer's disease: The mediating roles of ApoE.,"The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to rise due to the increasing aging population. Among the various genetic factors associated with AD, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a lipid transporter, stands out as the primary genetic risk factor. Specifically, individuals carrying the ApoE4 allele exhibit a significantly higher risk. However, emerging research indicates that dietary factors play a prominent role in modifying the risk of AD. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a prominent ω-3 fatty acid, has garnered considerable attention for its potential to ameliorate cognitive function. The intricate interplay between DHA and the ApoE genotype within the brain, which may influence DHA's utilization and functionality, warrants further investigation. This review meticulously examines experimental and clinical studies exploring the effects of DHA on cognitive decline. Special emphasis is placed on elucidating the role of ApoE gene polymorphism and the underlying mechanisms are discussed. These studies suggest that early DHA supplementation may confer benefits to cognitively normal older adults carrying the ApoE4 gene. However, once AD develops, ApoE4 non-carriers may experience greater benefits compared to ApoE4 carriers, although the overall effectiveness of DHA supplementation at this stage is limited. Potential mechanisms underlying these differential effects may include accelerated DHA catabolism in ApoE4 carriers, impaired transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and compromised lipidation and circulatory function in ApoE4 carriers. Thus, the supplementation of DHA may represent a potential intervention strategy aimed at compensating for these deficiencies in ApoE4 carriers prior to the onset of AD.",Zhang X; Yuan T; Chen X; Liu X; Hu J; Liu Z,Progress in lipid research,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37890592/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37836535,Epigenetic Biomarkers of Metabolic Responses to Lifestyle Interventions.,"Studies have examined the possible utility of epigenetic phenomena (DNA methylation changes, covalent histone modifications, and miRNA expression patterns) in predicting individual responses to different lifestyle programs. Nonetheless, most available evidence is focused on identifying epigenetic marks eventually associated with body composition and adiposity outcomes, whereas their roles in metabolic endings remain less explored. This document comprehensively reviewed the evidence regarding the use of epigenetic signatures as putative biomarkers of metabolic outcomes (glycemic, lipid, blood pressure, and inflammatory/oxidative stress features) in response to different lifestyle interventions in humans. Although more investigation is still necessary in order to translate this knowledge in clinical practice, these scientific insights are contributing to the design of advanced strategies for the precise management of cardiometabolic risk, gaining understanding on metabolic heterogeneity, allowing for the prediction of metabolic outcomes, and facilitating the design of epigenome-based nutritional strategies for a more customized approach for metabolic alterations treatment under the scope of precision nutrition.",Ramos-Lopez O,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37836535/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Modulating the gut microbiota and immune system with probiotics or genetically modified probiotics confers health benefits to the host and offers a novel strategy for preventing and treating food allergy. This systematic review aims to summarize the current proof of the role of probiotics in food allergy and propose a promising future research direction of using probiotics as a possible strategy of treatment for food allergy.",Wei Y; Peng J; Wang S; Ding Z; Chen G; Sun J,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37836443/,0,1,0,0,0,0
37702886,Precision Nutrition and Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction: the Promise of High-Density Lipoproteins.,"Emerging evidence supports the promise of precision nutritional approaches for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. Here, we discuss current findings from precision nutrition trials and studies reporting substantial inter-individual variability in responses to diets and dietary components relevant to CVD outcomes. We highlight examples where early precision nutrition research already points to actionable intervention targets tailored to an individual's biology and lifestyle. Finally, we make the case for high-density lipoproteins (HDL) as a compelling next generation target for precision nutrition aimed at CVD prevention. HDL possesses complex structural features including diverse protein components, lipids, size distribution, extensive glycosylation, and interacts with the gut microbiome, all of which influence HDL's anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and cholesterol efflux properties. Elucidating the nuances of HDL structure and function at an individual level may unlock personalized dietary and lifestyle strategies to optimize HDL-mediated atheroprotection and reduce CVD risk. Recent human studies have demonstrated that HDL particles are key players in the reduction of CVD risk. Our review highlights the role of HDL and the importance of personalized therapeutic approaches to improve their potential for reducing CVD risk. Factors such as diet, genetics, glycosylation, and gut microbiome interactions can modulate HDL structure and function at the individual level. We emphasize that fractionating HDL into size-based subclasses and measuring particle concentration are necessary to understand HDL biology and for developing the next generation of diagnostics and biomarkers. These discoveries underscore the need to move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach to HDL management. Precision nutrition strategies that account for personalized metabolic, genetic, and lifestyle data hold promise for optimizing HDL therapies and function to mitigate CVD risk more potently. While human studies show HDL play a key role in reducing CVD risk, recent findings indicate that factors such as diet, genetics, glycosylation, and gut microbes modulate HDL function at the individual level, underscoring the need for precision nutrition strategies that account for personalized variability to optimize HDL's potential for mitigating CVD risk.",Hong BV; Agus JK; Tang X; Zheng JJ; Romo EZ; Lei S; Zivkovic AM,Current atherosclerosis reports,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37702886/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37458294,Zebrafish as model organisms for toxicological evaluations in the field of food science.,"Food safety has long been an area of concern. The selection of stable and efficient model organisms is particularly important for food toxicology studies. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are small model vertebrates, and 70% of human genes have at least one zebrafish ortholog. Zebrafish have advantages as model organisms due to their short life cycle, strong reproductive ability, easy rearing, and low cost. Zebrafish embryos have the advantage of being sensitive to the breeding environment and thus have been used as biosensors. Zebrafish and their embryos have been widely used for food toxicology assessments. This review provides a systematic and comprehensive summary of food toxicology studies using zebrafish as model organisms. First, we briefly introduce the multidimensional mechanisms and structure-activity relationship studies of food toxicological assessment. Second, we categorize these studies according to eight types of hazards in foods, including mycotoxins, pesticides, antibiotics, heavy metals, endocrine disruptors, food additives, nanoparticles, and other food-related ingredients. Finally, we list the applications of zebrafish in food toxicology studies in line with future research prospects, aiming to provide a valuable reference for researchers in the field of food science.",Hou Y; Liu X; Qin Y; Hou Y; Hou J; Wu Q; Xu W,Comprehensive reviews in food science and food safety,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37458294/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37432488,Effect of High Fat Diet on Disease Development of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and Lifestyle Intervention Strategies.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent endocrine and metabolic disorder that affects premenopausal women. The etiology of PCOS is multifaceted, involving various genetic and epigenetic factors, hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian dysfunction, androgen excess, insulin resistance, and adipose-related mechanisms. High-fat diets (HFDs) has been linked to the development of metabolic disorders and weight gain, exacerbating obesity and impairing the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. This results in increased insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and the release of inflammatory adipokines, leading to heightened fat synthesis and reduced fat breakdown, thereby worsening the metabolic and reproductive consequences of PCOS. Effective management of PCOS requires lifestyle interventions such as dietary modifications, weight loss, physical activity, and psychological well-being, as well as medical or surgical interventions in some cases. This article systematically examines the pathological basis of PCOS and the influence of HFDs on its development, with the aim of raising awareness of the connection between diet and reproductive health, providing a robust approach to lifestyle interventions, and serving as a reference for the development of targeted drug treatments.",Han Y; Wu H; Sun S; Zhao R; Deng Y; Zeng S; Chen J,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37432488/,1,0,0,0,0,0
37335395,Behavioral and Psychological Factors Affecting Weight Loss Success.,"There is a large variability between individuals in the weight loss response to any given diet treatment, which fuels interest into personalized or precision nutrition. Although most efforts are directed toward identifying biological or metabolic factors, several behavioral and psychological factors can also be responsible for some of this interindividual variability. There are many factors that can influence the response to dietary weight loss interventions, including factors related to eating behavior (emotional eating, disinhibition, restraint, perceived stress), behaviors and societal norms related to age and sex, psychological and personal factors (motivation, self-efficacy, locus of control, self-concept), and major life events. The success of a weight loss intervention can be influenced by many psychological and behavioral constructs and not merely by physiological factors such as biology and genetics. These factors are difficult to capture accurately and are often overlooked. Future weight loss studies should consider assessing such factors to better understand the underlying reasons for the large interindividual variability to weight loss therapy.",Pigsborg K; Kalea AZ; De Dominicis S; Magkos F,Current obesity reports,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37335395/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Both are indispensable to human beings and closely related to life and death. This article discusses the similarities in various aspects between mitochondria and Yang Qi, including body temperature, aging, newborns, circadian rhythm, immunity, and meridian. It is well-known that Yang Qi is vital for human health. Interestingly, decreased mitochondrial function is thought to be key to the development of various diseases. Here, we further explain diseases induced by Yang Qi deficiency, such as cancer, chronic fatigue syndrome, sleep disorder, senile dementia, and metabolic diseases, from the perspective of mitochondrial function. We aim to establish similarities and connections between two important concepts, and hope our essay can stimulate further discussion and investigation on unifying important concepts in western medicine and alternative medicine, especially TCM, and provide unique holistic insights into understanding human health.",Luo J; Shen S; Xia J; Wang J; Gu Z,"Phenomics (Cham, Switzerland)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36939762/,1,0,0,0,0,0

However, the pendulum has swung because of our increased understanding of the importance of fibers in maintaining a health-associated microbiome. Preliminary evidence suggests that dietary fiber can alter the gut microbiome, improve IBD symptoms, balance inflammation, and enhance health-related quality of life. Therefore, it is now more vital than ever to examine how fiber could be used as a therapeutic strategy to manage and prevent disease relapse. At present, there is limited knowledge about which fibers are optimal and in what form and quantity they should be consumed to benefit patients with IBD. Additionally, individual microbiomes play a strong role in determining the outcomes and necessitate a more personalized nutritional approach to implementing dietary changes, as dietary fiber may not be as benign as once thought in a dysbiotic microbiome. This review describes dietary fibers and their mechanism of action within the microbiome, details novel fiber sources, including resistant starches and polyphenols, and concludes with potential future directions in fiber research, including the move toward precision nutrition.",Haskey N; Gold SL; Faith JJ; Raman M,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36904081/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Perturbation in host nutritional status influences gut microbiome composition and vice versa. The gut microbiome can help in producing vitamins, hormones, and other active metabolites that support the immune system; harvest energy from food; aid in digestion; protect against pathogens; improve gut transit and function; send signals to the brain and other organs; oscillate the circadian rhythm; and coordinate with the host metabolism through multiple cellular pathways. Gut microbiota can be influenced by host genetics, medications, diet, and lifestyle factors from preterm to aging. Aligning with precision nutrition, identifying a personalized microbiome mandates the provision of the right nutrients at the right time to the right patient. Thus, before prescribing a personalized treatment, it is crucial to monitor and count the gut flora as a focused biomarker. Many nutritional approaches that have been developed help in maintaining and restoring an optimal microbiome such as specific diet therapy, nutrition interventions, and customized eating patterns. One of these approaches is time-restricted feeding/eating (TRF/E), a type of intermittent fasting (IF) in which a subject abstains from food intake for a specific time window. Such a dietary modification might alter and restore the gut microbiome for proper alignment of cellular and molecular pathways throughout the lifespan. In this review, we have highlighted that the gut microbiota would be a targeted biomarker and TRF/E would be a targeted approach for restoring the gut-microbiome-associated molecular pathways such as hormonal signaling, the circadian system, metabolic regulators, neural responses, and immune-inflammatory pathways. Consequently, modulation of the gut microbiota through TRF/E could contribute to proper utilization and availability of the nutrients and in this way confer protection against diseases for harnessing personalized nutrition approaches to improve human health.",Zeb F; Osaili T; Obaid RS; Naja F; Radwan H; Cheikh Ismail L; Hasan H; Hashim M; Alam I; Sehar B; Faris ME,Nutrients,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36678130/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36501140,Implementation of Nutrigenetics and Nutrigenomics Research and Training Activities for Developing Precision Nutrition Strategies in Malaysia.,"Nutritional epidemiological studies show a triple burden of malnutrition with disparate prevalence across the coexisting ethnicities in Malaysia. To tackle malnutrition and related conditions in Malaysia, research in the new and evolving field of nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics is essential. As part of the Gene-Nutrient Interactions (GeNuIne) Collaboration, the Nutrigenetics and Nutrigenomics Research and Training Unit (N<sup>2</sup>RTU) aims to solve the malnutrition paradox. This review discusses and presents a conceptual framework that shows the pathway to implementing and strengthening precision nutrition strategies in Malaysia. The framework is divided into: (1) Research and (2) Training and Resource Development. The first arm collects data from genetics, genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, gut microbiome, and phenotypic and lifestyle factors to conduct nutrigenetic, nutrigenomic, and nutri-epigenetic studies. The second arm is focused on training and resource development to improve the capacity of the stakeholders (academia, healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the food industry) to utilise the findings generated by research in their respective fields. Finally, the N<sup>2</sup>RTU framework foresees its applications in artificial intelligence and the implementation of precision nutrition through the action of stakeholders.",Dhanapal ACTA; Wuni R; Ventura EF; Chiet TK; Cheah ESG; Loganathan A; Quen PL; Appukutty M; Noh MFM; Givens I; Vimaleswaran KS,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36501140/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36455237,Chlorogenic acid improves food allergy through the AMPK/ACC/CPT-1 pathway.,"Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a polyphenol prevalent in daily food and plants. Food allergy (FA) can lead to metabolic disorders of the immune system. The objective of this study was to investigate CGA therapeutic effect on FA and regulatory mechanism through shrimp food allergy in mice models. Here, 24 female BALB/C mice were randomly allocated into the (I) Control group, (II) Food allergy group, (III) Chlorogenic acid low (50 mg/kg), and (IV) high group (200 mg/kg). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that CGA decreased levels of IgE and IgG induced by food allergy significantly. Real-time PCR demonstrated that high-dose chlorogenic acid significantly reduced Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) mRNA expression and increased Carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) mRNA expression. Western blot indicated that CGA promoted a noticeable increase at the levels of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and ACC phosphorylation, resulting in a significant activation in AMPK and inhibition in ACC, and increased CPT-1 expression. Consequently, CGA improves FA by the regulation of the AMPK/ACC/CPT-1 signaling pathway in the spleen. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Chlorogenic acid is a water-soluble polyphenolic substance that is widely distributed in natural plants that show a variety of pharmacological effects. At present, CGA has been developed as a weigh-reducing tonic in western countries. As one of the most widely found and most easily obtained phenolic acids from food, the diverse physiological effects of CGA (such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, metabolic regulation, intestinal microbial regulation, etc.) imply its potential for application in functional foods, food additives, and clinical medicine. However, the basic molecular mechanisms of its effects have not been elucidated. In this study, CGA reduced allergy in a mouse model, likely by interacting with the AMPK/ACC/CPT-1 pathway.",Yun Z; Zou Z; Sun S; Che H,Journal of food biochemistry,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36455237/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36421817,Multi-Omics Nutritional Approaches Targeting Metabolic-Associated Fatty Liver Disease.,"Currently, metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a leading global cause of chronic liver disease, and is expected to become one of the most common indications of liver transplantation. MAFLD is associated with obesity, involving multiple mechanisms such as alterations in lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, hyperinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, and extracellular matrix formation. However, the onset and progression of MAFLD is variable among individuals, being influenced by intrinsic (personal) and external environmental factors. In this context, sequence structural variants across the human genome, epigenetic phenomena (i.e., DNA methylation, histone modifications, and long non-coding RNAs) affecting gene expression, gut microbiota dysbiosis, and metabolomics/lipidomic fingerprints may account for differences in MAFLD outcomes through interactions with nutritional features. This knowledge may contribute to gaining a deeper understanding of the molecular and physiological processes underlying MAFLD pathogenesis and phenotype heterogeneity, as well as facilitating the identification of biomarkers of disease progression and therapeutic targets for the implementation of tailored nutritional strategies. This comprehensive literature review highlights the potential of nutrigenetic, nutriepigenetic, nutrimetagenomic, nutritranscriptomics, and nutrimetabolomic approaches for the prevention and management of MAFLD in humans through the lens of precision nutrition.",Ramos-Lopez O,Genes,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36421817/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36125787,Precision Nutrition: Recent Advances in Obesity.,"""Precision nutrition"" is an emerging area of nutrition research that focuses on understanding metabolic variability within and between individuals and helps develop customized dietary plans and interventions to maintain optimal individual health. It encompasses nutritional genomic (gene-nutrient interactions), epigenetic, microbiome, and environmental factors. Obesity is a complex disease that is affected by genetic and environmental factors and thus a relevant target of precision nutrition-based approaches. Recent studies have shown significant associations between obesity phenotypes (body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, and central and regional adiposity) and genetic variants, epigenetic factors (DNA methylation and noncoding RNA), microbial species, and environment (sociodemographics and physical activity). Additionally, studies have also shown that the interactions between genetic variants, microbial metabolites, and epigenetic factors affect energy balance and adiposity. These include variants in <i>FTO, MC4R, PPAR</i>, <i>APOA</i>, and <i>FADS</i> genes, DNA methylation in CpG island regions, and specific miRNAs and microbial species such as <i>Firmicutes</i>, <i>Bacteriodes</i>, <i>Clostridiales,</i> etc. Similarly, studies have shown that microbial metabolites, folate, B-vitamins, and short-chain fatty acids interact with miRNAs to influence obesity phenotypes. With the advent of next-generation sequencing and analytical approaches, the advances in precision nutrition have the potential to lead to new paradigms, which can further lead to interventions or customized treatments specific to individuals or susceptible groups of individuals. This review highlights the recent advances in precision nutrition as applied to obesity and projects the importance of precision nutrition in obesity and weight management.",Voruganti VS,"Physiology (Bethesda, Md.)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36125787/,1,0,0,0,0,0
36118748,Precision nutrition: Maintaining scientific integrity while realizing market potential.,"Precision Nutrition (PN) is an approach to developing comprehensive and dynamic nutritional recommendations based on individual variables, including genetics, microbiome, metabolic profile, health status, physical activity, dietary pattern, food environment as well as socioeconomic and psychosocial characteristics. PN can help answer the question ""What should I eat to be healthy?"", recognizing that what is healthful for one individual may not be the same for another, and understanding that health and responses to diet change over time. The growth of the PN market has been driven by increasing consumer interest in individualized products and services coupled with advances in technology, analytics, and omic sciences. However, important concerns are evident regarding the adequacy of scientific substantiation supporting claims for current products and services. An additional limitation to accessing PN is the current cost of diagnostic tests and wearable devices. Despite these challenges, PN holds great promise as a tool to improve healthspan and reduce healthcare costs. Accelerating advancement in PN will require: (a) investment in multidisciplinary collaborations to enable the development of user-friendly tools applying technological advances in omics, sensors, artificial intelligence, big data management, and analytics; (b) engagement of healthcare professionals and payers to support equitable and broader adoption of PN as medicine shifts toward preventive and personalized approaches; and (c) system-wide collaboration between stakeholders to advocate for continued support for evidence-based PN, develop a regulatory framework to maintain consumer trust and engagement, and allow PN to reach its full potential.",Berciano S; Figueiredo J; Brisbois TD; Alford S; Koecher K; Eckhouse S; Ciati R; Kussmann M; Ordovas JM; Stebbins K; Blumberg JB,Frontiers in nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36118748/,1,0,0,0,0,0

For this purpose, the present manuscript reviews the available GWAS registered on the GWAS Catalog reporting the interaction between environmental factors and metabolic syndrome traits. Advances in omics-related analytical and computational approaches in recent years have led to a better understanding of the biological processes underlying these G × E interactions. A total of 42 GWAS were analysed, reporting over 300 loci interacting with environmental factors. Alcohol consumption, sleep time, smoking habit and physical activity were the most studied environmental factors with significant G × E interactions. The implementation of more comprehensive GWAS will provide a better understanding of the metabolic processes that determine individual responses to environmental exposures and their association with the development of chronic diseases such as obesity and the metabolic syndrome. This will facilitate the development of precision approaches for better prevention, management and treatment of these diseases.",San-Cristobal R; de Toro-Martín J; Vohl MC,Current nutrition reports,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35948824/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Reproducible findings from the observational studies and diet intervention trials have lent preliminary but consistent evidence to support the fundamental role of gene-diet interactions in determining the individual variability in health outcomes including obesity and weight loss. Recent investigations suggest that the abundance and diversity of the gut microbiome may also modify the dietary effects; however, considerable instability in the results from the microbiome research has been noted. In addition, growing studies suggest that a complicated multiomics algorithm would be developed by incorporating the genome, epigenome, metabolome, proteome, and microbiome in predicting the individual variability in response to diets. Moreover, precision nutrition would also scrutinize the role of biological (circadian) rhythm in determining the individual variability of dietary effects. The evidence gathered from precision nutrition research will be the basis for constructing precision health dietary recommendations, which hold great promise to help individuals and their health care providers create precise and effective diet plans for precision health in the future.",Qi L,"Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35785484/,1,0,0,0,0,0

However, the response to dietary interventions varies widely, highlighting the need for refinement and personalisation beyond population-based 'one size fits all'. This article reviews the clinical evidence supporting precision nutrition as a fundamental approach for dietary advice in diabetes. Further, it proposes a framework for the eventual implementation of precision nutrition and discusses key challenges for the application of this approach in the prevention of diabetes. One implication of this approach is that precision nutrition would not exclude the parallel goal of population-based healthy dietary advice. Nevertheless, the shift in prioritising precision nutrition is needed to reflect the dynamic nature of responses to dietary interventions that vary among individuals and change over the life course.",Merino J,Diabetologia,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35593923/,1,0,0,0,0,0
35387533,"Current progress of miRNA-derivative nucleotide drugs: modifications, delivery systems, applications.","miRNA-derivative clinical nucleotide drugs (mdCNDs) effectively treat several diseases, with numerous undergoing clinical trials. In early-stage trials in disease therapeutics, such as malignant pleural mesothelioma and hepatic virus C infection, mdCND's therapeutic potency is undeniably good for effectiveness and safety. Fifteen mdCNDs undergoing clinical trials are introduced in this review. MiRNA modifications methods have been summarized, including phosphorothioate, cholesterol, locked nucleic acid, 2'-O-methyl, N,N-diethyl-4-(4-nitronaphthalen1-ylazo)-phenylamine modifications, and many more. Moreover, delivery systems, including self-assembled, inorganic ions nanoparticles, exosomes, and lipid-based nanosystems for mdCNDs targeted delivery, are presented. Among that, EnGeneIC, N-Acetylgalactosamine, liposomal nanoparticles, and cholesterol-conjugated for mdCNDs delivery are currently undergoing clinical trials. The pH, light, temperature, redox-responsive, enzyme, and specific-substance modes to trigger the release of miRNAs to target sites on-demand and the prospects of mdCNDs are discussed in this review. mdNCDs are one type of promising clinical drugs, however, it is still in the infancy.

34901112,The Functional Role of Lactoferrin in Intestine Mucosal Immune System and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is one of the main types of intestinal inflammatory diseases with intestine mucosal immune disorder. Intestine mucosal immune system plays a remarkable and important role in the etiology and pathogenesis of IBD. Therefore, understanding the intestine mucosal immune mechanism is a key step to develop therapeutic interventions for IBD. Intestine mucosal immune system and IBD are influenced by various factors, such as inflammation, gut permeability, gut microbiota, and nutrients. Among these factors, emerging evidence show that nutrients play a key role in inflammation activation, integrity of intestinal barrier, and immune cell modulation. Lactoferrin (LF), an iron-binding glycoprotein belonging to transferrin family, is a dietary bioactive component abundantly found in mammalian milk. Notably, LF has been reported to perform diverse biological functions including antibacterial activity, anti-inflammatory activity, intestinal barrier protection, and immune cell modulation, and is involved in maintaining intestine mucosal immune homeostasis. The improved understanding of the properties of LF in intestine mucosal immune system and IBD will facilitate its application in nutrition, clinical medicine, and health. Herein, this review outlines the recent advancements on LF as a potential therapeutic intervention for IBD associated with intestine mucosal immune system dysfunction. We hope this review will provide a reference for future studies and lay a theoretical foundation for LF-based therapeutic interventions for IBD by understanding the particular effects of LF on intestine mucosal immune system.",Liu N; Feng G; Zhang X; Hu Q; Sun S; Sun J; Sun Y; Wang R; Zhang Y; Wang P; Li Y,Frontiers in nutrition,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34901112/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34360741,An Overview of Adipose Tissue ACE2 Modulation by Diet and Obesity. Potential Implications in COVID-19 Infection and Severity.,"The present review is aimed at analysing the current evidence concerning the potential modulation of obesity and/or diet in adipose tissue ACE2. Additionally, the potential implications of these effects on COVID-19 are also addressed. The results published show that diet and obesity are two factors that effectively influence the expression of <i>Ace2</i> gene in adipose tissue. However, the shifts in this gene do not always occur in the same direction, nor with the same intensity. Additionally, there is no consensus regarding the implications of increased adipose tissue ACE2 expression in health. Thus, while in some studies a protective role is attributed to ACE2 overexpression, other studies suggest otherwise. Similarly, there is much debate regarding the role played by ACE2 in COVID-19 in terms of degree of infection and disease outcomes. The greater risk of infection that may hypothetically derive from enhanced ACE2 expression is not clear since the functionality of the enzyme seems to be as important as the abundance. Thus, the greater abundance of ACE2 in adipose tissue of obese subjects may be counterbalanced by its lower activation. In addition, a protective role of ACE2 overexpression has also been suggested, associated with the increase in anti-inflammatory factors that it may produce.",Gómez-Zorita S; Milton-Laskibar I; García-Arellano L; González M; Portillo MP,International journal of molecular sciences,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34360741/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34360695,The Mechanism of Secretion and Metabolism of Gut-Derived 5-Hydroxytryptamine.,"Serotonin, also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), is a metabolite of tryptophan and is reported to modulate the development and neurogenesis of the enteric nervous system, gut motility, secretion, inflammation, sensation, and epithelial development. Approximately 95% of 5-HT in the body is synthesized and secreted by enterochromaffin (EC) cells, the most common type of neuroendocrine cells in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, through sensing signals from the intestinal lumen and the circulatory system. Gut microbiota, nutrients, and hormones are the main factors that play a vital role in regulating 5-HT secretion by EC cells. Apart from being an important neurotransmitter and a paracrine signaling molecule in the gut, gut-derived 5-HT was also shown to exert other biological functions (in autism and depression) far beyond the gut. Moreover, studies conducted on the regulation of 5-HT in the immune system demonstrated that 5-HT exerts anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory effects on the gut by binding to different receptors under intestinal inflammatory conditions. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms through which 5-HT participates in cell metabolism and physiology can provide potential therapeutic strategies for treating intestinal diseases. Herein, we review recent evidence to recapitulate the mechanisms of synthesis, secretion, regulation, and biofunction of 5-HT to improve the nutrition and health of humans.",Liu N; Sun S; Wang P; Sun Y; Hu Q; Wang X,International journal of molecular sciences,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34360695/,1,0,0,0,0,0
34201625,Omega-3 Supplementation and Heart Disease: A Population-Based Diet by Gene Analysis of Clinical Trial Outcomes.,"Omega-3 (<i>n</i>-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and their metabolites have long been recognized to protect against inflammation-related diseases including heart disease. Recent reports present conflicting evidence on the effects of <i>n</i>-3 PUFAs on major cardiovascular events including death. While some studies document that <i>n</i>-3 PUFA supplementation reduces the risk for heart disease, others report no beneficial effects on heart disease composite primary outcomes. Much of this heterogeneity may be related to the genetic variation in different individuals/populations that alters their capacity to synthesize biologically active <i>n</i>-3 and omega 6 (<i>n</i>-6) PUFAs and metabolites from their 18 carbon dietary precursors, linoleic acid (LA, 18:2 <i>n</i>-6) and alpha-linolenic (ALA, 18:3, <i>n</i>-3). Here, we discuss the role of a <i>FADS</i> gene-by-dietary PUFA interaction model that takes into consideration dietary exposure, including the intake of LA and ALA, <i>n</i>-3 PUFAs, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in determining the efficacy of <i>n</i>-3 PUFA supplementation. We also review recent clinical trials with <i>n</i>-3 PUFA supplementation and coronary heart disease in the context of what is known about fatty acid desaturase (<i>FADS)</i> gene-by-dietary PUFA interactions. Given the dramatic differences in the frequencies of <i>FADS</i> variants that impact the efficiency of <i>n</i>-3 and <i>n</i>-6 PUFA biosynthesis, and their downstream signaling products among global and admixture populations, we conclude that large clinical trials utilizing ""one size fits all"" <i>n</i>-3 PUFA supplementation approaches are unlikely to show effectiveness. However, evidence discussed in this review suggests that <i>n</i>-3 PUFA supplementation may represent an important opportunity where precision interventions can be focused on those populations that will benefit the most from <i>n</i>-3 PUFA supplementation.",Fernandez ML; Blomquist SA; Hallmark B; Chilton FH,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34201625/,1,0,0,0,0,0

34062793,Dietary Selenium Regulates microRNAs in Metabolic Disease: Recent Progress.,"Selenium (Se) is an essential element for the maintenance of a healthy physiological state. However, due to environmental and dietary factors and the narrow safety range of Se, diseases caused by Se deficiency or excess have gained considerable traction in recent years. In particular, links have been identified between low Se status, cognitive decline, immune disorders, and increased mortality, whereas excess Se increases metabolic risk. Considerable evidence has suggested microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate interactions between the environment (including the diet) and genes, and play important roles in several diseases, including cancer. MiRNAs target messenger RNAs to induce changes in proteins including selenoprotein expression, ultimately generating disease. While a plethora of data exists on the epigenetic regulation of other dietary factors, nutrient Se epigenetics and especially miRNA regulated mechanisms remain unclear. Thus, this review mainly focuses on Se metabolism, pathogenic mechanisms, and miRNAs as key regulatory factors in Se-related diseases.

34039840,Recent advances in understanding the adaptive evolution of metabolic genes and traits.,"This review summarizes the recent advances in understanding the adaptive evolution of metabolic genes and traits, providing insights into gene-diet interactions in human evolution and health. The rapid accumulation of ancient DNA across time and geography illuminates unprecedented details of some well-established examples of genetic adaptation to diet, such as the LCT and FADS genes. Novel cases of thrifty genes were identified, especially a microRNA at the LCT locus that controls energy expenditure and glucose homeostasis, connecting the historical adaptation to present-day metabolic disorders. A new example of gene-diet-microbiota interactions was established among the AMY1 copy number, starchy diets, and resistant-starch-digesting Ruminococcus. The explosion of genome-wide association studies in large cohorts unravels the present-day health implications of historically adaptive genetic variants. It also enables studies into the polygenic adaptation of metabolic traits, revealing intriguing adaptive signals for increased bone mineral density, blood pressure, and risk of type 2 diabetes, but decreased body mass index and HbA1c. The rapid accumulation of ancient and modern DNA has fueled the characterization of novel and existing cases of genetic adaptation.

33921683,Precision Nutrition for Alzheimer's Prevention in <i>ApoE4</i> Carriers.,"The <i>ApoE4</i> allele is the most well-studied genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, a condition that is increasing in prevalence and remains without a cure. Precision nutrition targeting metabolic pathways altered by <i>ApoE4</i> provides a tool for the potential prevention of disease. However, no long-term human studies have been conducted to determine effective nutritional protocols for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease in <i>ApoE4</i> carriers. This may be because relatively little is yet known about the precise mechanisms by which the genetic variant confers an increased risk of dementia. Fortunately, recent research is beginning to shine a spotlight on these mechanisms. These new data open up the opportunity for speculation as to how carriers might ameliorate risk through lifestyle and nutrition. Herein, we review recent discoveries about how <i>ApoE4</i> differentially impacts microglia and inflammatory pathways, astrocytes and lipid metabolism, pericytes and blood-brain barrier integrity, and insulin resistance and glucose metabolism. We use these data as a basis to speculate a precision nutrition approach for <i>ApoE4</i> carriers, including a low-glycemic index diet with a ketogenic option, specific Mediterranean-style food choices, and a panel of seven nutritional supplements. Where possible, we integrate basic scientific mechanisms with human observational studies to create a more complete and convincing rationale for this precision nutrition approach. Until recent research discoveries can be translated into long-term human studies, a mechanism-informed practical clinical approach may be useful for clinicians and patients with <i>ApoE4</i> to adopt a lifestyle and nutrition plan geared towards Alzheimer's risk reduction.",Norwitz NG; Saif N; Ariza IE; Isaacson RS,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33921683/,1,0,0,0,0,0

This information may be translated into the implementation of personalized nutrition approaches involving precision nutrigenetic and nutrigenomic strategies for obesity monitoring and weight management. The importance and influence of several nongenetic contributors to obesity onset and individual responses to weight-loss interventions have been highlighted including the role of age, sex or perinatal feeding and others related to an individual's lifestyle and modifiable. Nutrigenetic studies have analysed potential interactions between polymorphisms influencing energy homeostasis/body composition and dietary factors in relation to adiposity phenotypes and therapy responsiveness. A second approach comprises the Nutrigenomic analysis of gene expression modifications in response to the consumption of specific nutrients or dietary bioactive compounds, which may involve epigenetic mechanisms including deoxyribonucleic acid methylation and micro-ribonucleic acid expression profiles. Taken together, these findings encompass the importance of taking into account up-to-date advances in Nutrigenetic and Nutrigenomic hallmarks, globally analysing the risk of weight gain and related outcomes after following nutrition counselling, this contributing to improve obesity care considering phenotypical traits and the genetic make-up for precision obesity care.",Ramos-Lopez O; Milton-Laskibar I; Martínez JA,Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33859118/,1,0,0,0,0,0
33794384,"Polyunsaturated fatty acids, specialized pro-resolving mediators, and targeting inflammation resolution in the age of precision nutrition.","Chronic inflammation contributes toward the pathogenesis of numerous diseases including, but not limited to, obesity, autoimmunity, cardiovascular diseases, and cancers. The discovery of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), which are critical for resolving inflammation, has commenced investigation into targeting pathways of inflammation resolution to improve physiological outcomes. SPMs are predominately synthesized from the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids. Therefore, one viable strategy to promote inflammation resolution would be to increase dietary intake of EPA/DHA, which are deficient in select populations. However, there are inconsistencies between the use of EPA/DHA as dietary or pharmacological supplements and improved inflammatory status. Herein, we review the literature on the relationship between the high n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio, downstream SPM biosynthesis, and inflammatory endpoints. We highlight key studies that have investigated how dietary intake of EPA/DHA increase tissue SPMs and their effects on inflammation. We also discuss the biochemical pathways by which EPA/DHA drive SPM biosynthesis and underscore mechanistic gaps in knowledge about these pathways which include a neglect for host genetics/ethnic differences in SPM metabolism, sexual dimorphism in SPM levels, and potential competition from select dietary n-6 PUFAs for enzymes of SPM synthesis. Altogether, establishing how dietary PUFAs control SPM biosynthesis in a genetic- and sex-dependent manner will drive new precision nutrition studies with EPA/DHA to prevent chronic inflammation in select populations.",Al-Shaer AE; Buddenbaum N; Shaikh SR,Biochimica et biophysica acta.

33461193,Gene-Centric Database Reveals Environmental and Lifestyle Relationships for Potential Risk Modification and Prevention.,"The database at Nutrigenetics.net has been under development since 2007 to facilitate the identification and classification of PubMed articles relevant to human genetics. A controlled vocabulary (i.e., standardized terminology) is used to index these records, with links back to PubMed for every article title. This enables the display of indexes (alphabetical subtopic listings) for any given topic, or for any given combination of topics, including for genes and specific genetic variants. Stepwise use of such indexes (first for one topic, then for combinations of topics) can reveal relationships that are otherwise easily overlooked. These relationships include environmental and lifestyle variables with potential relevance to risk modification (both beneficial and detrimental), and to prevention, or at least to the potential delay of symptom onset for health conditions like Alzheimer disease among many others. Thirty-four specific genetic variants have each been mentioned in at least ≥1,000 PubMed titles/abstracts, and these numbers are steadily increasing. The benefits of indexing with standardized terminology are illustrated for genetic variants like MTHFR 677C-T and its various synonyms (e.g., rs1801133 or Ala222Val). Such use of a controlled vocabulary is also helpful for numerous health conditions, and for potential risk modifiers (i.e., potential risk/effect modifiers).",Martin RL,Lifestyle genomics,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33461193/,1,0,0,0,0,0

Additionally, the epigenetic phenomena underlying the anti-inflammatory potential of caloric restriction, n-3 PUFA, Mediterranean diet, vitamin D, zinc, polyphenols (i.e., resveratrol, gallic acid, epicatechin, luteolin, curcumin), and the role of systematic exercise are discussed. Original and review articles encompassing epigenetics and inflammation were screened from major databases (including PubMed, Medline, Science Direct, Scopus, etc.) and analyzed for the writing of the review paper. Although caution should be exercised, research on epigenetic mechanisms is contributing to understand pathological processes involving inflammatory responses, the prediction of disease risk based on the epigenotype, as well as the putative design of therapeutic interventions targeting the epigenome.",Ramos-Lopez O; Milagro FI; Riezu-Boj JI; Martinez JA,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

33110916,Exploring Host Genetic Polymorphisms Involved in SARS-CoV Infection Outcomes: Implications for Personalized Medicine in COVID-19.,"To systematically explore genetic polymorphisms associated with the clinical outcomes in SARS-CoV infection in humans. This comprehensive literature search comprised available English papers published in PubMed/Medline and SCOPUS databases following the PRISMA-P guidelines and PICO/AXIS criteria. Twenty-nine polymorphisms located in 21 genes were identified as associated with SARS-CoV susceptibility/resistance, disease severity, and clinical outcomes predominantly in Asian populations. Thus, genes implicated in key pathophysiological processes such as the mechanisms related to the entry of the virus into the cell and the antiviral immune/inflammatory responses were identified. Although caution must be taken, the results of this systematic review suggest that multiple genetic polymorphisms are associated with SARS-CoV infection features by affecting virus pathogenesis and host immune response, which could have important applications for the study and understanding of genetics in SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 and for personalized translational clinical practice depending on the population studied and associated environments.",Ramos-Lopez O; Daimiel L; Ramírez de Molina A; Martínez-Urbistondo D; Vargas JA; Martínez JA,International journal of genomics,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33110916/,1,0,0,0,0,0

However, relatively little is known about most specific gene-diet interactions, and many molecular and clinical phenotypes of interest (e.g., body mass index [BMI]) involve multiple genes. In this review, we discuss direct to consumer genetic testing (DTC-GT) and the current potential for precision nutrition based on an individual's genetic data. We review important issues such as dietary exposure and genetic architecture addressing the concepts of penetrance, pleiotropy, epistasis, polygenicity, and epigenetics. More specifically, we discuss how they complicate using genotypic data to predict phenotypes as well as response to dietary interventions. Then, several examples (including caffeine sensitivity, alcohol dependence, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity/appetite, cardiovascular, Alzheimer's disease, folate metabolism, long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis, and vitamin D metabolism) are provided illustrating how genotypic information could be used to inform nutritional recommendations.

Nutrients (namely, carbohydrates, fat, protein, mineral substances, and vitamin), sensing, and management are central to metabolic homeostasis, therefore presenting a leading factor contributing to T2D. Understanding the comprehensive effects and the underlying mechanisms of nutrition in regulating glucose metabolism and the interactions of diet with genetics, epigenetics, and gut microbiota is helpful for developing new strategies to prevent and treat T2D. In this review, we discuss different mechanistic pathways contributing to T2D and then summarize the current researches concerning associations between different nutrients intake and glucose homeostasis. We also explore the possible relationship between nutrients and genetic background, epigenetics, and metagenomics in terms of the susceptibility and treatment of T2D. For the specificity of individual, precision nutrition depends on the person's genotype, and microbiota is vital to the prevention and intervention of T2D.",Guo Y; Huang Z; Sang D; Gao Q; Li Q,Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33042976/,1,0,0,0,0,0
32721626,Nano-enabled personalized nutrition: Developing multicomponent-bioactive colloidal delivery systems.,"There is growing interest in the production of foods and beverages with nutrient and nutraceutical profiles tailored to an individual's specific nutritional requirements. In principle, these personalized nutrition products are formulated based on the genetics, epigenetics, metabolism, microbiome, phenotype, lifestyle, age, gender, and health status of a person. A challenge in this area is to create customized functional food and beverage products that contain the required combination of bioactive agents, such as lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, nutraceuticals, prebiotics and probiotics. Nanotechnology may facilitate the development of these kind of products since it can be used to encapsulate one or more bioactive agent in a single colloidal delivery system. This delivery system may contain one or more different kinds of colloidal particle, specifically designed to protect each nutrient in the food, but then deliver it in a bioavailable form after ingestion. This review article provides an overview of the different kinds of bioactives that need to be delivered, as well as some of the challenges associated with incorporating them into functional foods and beverages. It then highlights how nanotech-enabled colloidal delivery systems can be developed to encapsulate multiple bioactive agents in a form suitable for functional food applications, particularly in the personalized nutrition field.",McClements DJ,Advances in colloid and interface science,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32721626/,1,0,0,0,0,0

In this Review, we summarize the current research concerning associations between the intake of different macronutrients and weight gain and adiposity. We discuss insights into possible differential mechanistic pathways where macronutrients might act on either appetite or adipogenesis to cause weight gain. We also explore the role of dietary macronutrient distribution on thermogenesis or energy expenditure for weight loss and maintenance. On the basis of the data discussed, we describe a novel way to manage excessive body weight; namely, prescribing personalized diets with different macronutrient compositions according to the individual's genotype and/or enterotype. In this context, the interplay of macronutrient consumption with obesity incidence involves mechanisms that affect appetite, thermogenesis and metabolism, and the outcomes of these mechanisms are altered by an individual's genotype and microbiota. Indeed, the interactions of the genetic make-up and/or microbiota features of a person with specific macronutrient intakes or dietary pattern consumption help to explain individualized responses to macronutrients and food patterns, which might represent key factors for comprehensive precision nutrition recommendations and personalized obesity management.",San-Cristobal R; Navas-Carretero S; Martínez-González MÁ; Ordovas JM; Martínez JA,Nature reviews.

Many inputs contribute to metabolic heterogeneity (including variations in genetics, epigenetics, microbiome, lifestyle, diet intake, and environmental exposure). Precision nutrition is not about developing unique prescriptions for individual people but rather about stratifying people into different subgroups of the population on the basis of biomarkers of the above-listed sources of metabolic variation and then using this stratification to better estimate the different subgroups' dietary requirements, thereby enabling better dietary recommendations and interventions. The hope is that we will be able to subcategorize people into ever-smaller groups that can be targeted in terms of recommendations, but we will never achieve this at the individual level, thus, the choice of precision nutrition rather than personalized nutrition to designate this new field. This review focuses mainly on genetically related sources of metabolic heterogeneity and identifies challenges that need to be overcome to achieve a full understanding of the complex interactions between the many sources of metabolic heterogeneity that make people differ from one another in their requirements for and responses to foods.

Advances in genomics, metabolomics, and proteomics are improving our understanding regarding cancer metabolic diversity, resulting in detailed classifications of tumors and raising the effectiveness of precision medicine. Likewise, the growing knowledge of interactions between nutrients and the expression of certain genes could lead to cancer therapies based on precision nutrition strategies. This review aims to identify the recent advances in the knowledge of the mechanistic role of bioactive phytochemicals in foodstuffs in tumor progression, metastasis, and chemo-resistance in order to assess their potential use in precision nutrition therapies targeting relapse in lung, breast, colon, and prostate cancer, and leukemia. A considerable number of bioactive phytochemicals in foodstuffs were identified in the literature with proven effects modulating tumor growth, progression, and metastasis. In addition, the use of foodstuffs in cancer, and specifically in relapse therapies, is being reinforced by the development of different formulations that significantly increase the therapeutic efficiency of these products.

31252674,Precision Nutrition and the Microbiome Part II: Potential Opportunities and Pathways to Commercialisation.,"Modulation of the human gut microbiota through probiotics, prebiotics and dietary fibre are recognised strategies to improve health and prevent disease. Yet we are only beginning to understand the impact of these interventions on the gut microbiota and the physiological consequences for the human host, thus forging the way towards evidence-based scientific validation. However, in many studies a percentage of participants can be defined as 'non-responders' and scientists are beginning to unravel what differentiates these from 'responders;' and it is now clear that an individual's baseline microbiota can influence an individual's response. Thus, microbiome composition can potentially serve as a biomarker to predict responsiveness to interventions, diets and dietary components enabling greater opportunities for its use towards disease prevention and health promotion. In Part I of this two-part review, we reviewed the current state of the science in terms of the gut microbiota and the role of diet and dietary components in shaping it and subsequent consequences for human health. In Part II, we examine the efficacy of gut-microbiota modulating therapies at different life stages and their potential to aid in the management of undernutrition and overnutrition. Given the significance of an individual's gut microbiota, we investigate the feasibility of microbiome testing and we discuss guidelines for evaluating the scientific validity of evidence for providing personalised microbiome-based dietary advice.

31225587,The Role of the Gut Microbiome in Predicting Response to Diet and the Development of Precision Nutrition Models. Part II: Results.,"The gut microbiota is increasingly implicated in the health and metabolism of its human host. The host's diet is a major component influencing the composition and function of the gut microbiota, and mounting evidence suggests that the composition and function of the gut microbiota influence the host's metabolic response to diet. This effect of the gut microbiota on personalized dietary response is a growing focus of precision nutrition research and may inform the effort to tailor dietary advice to the individual. Because the gut microbiota has been shown to be malleable to some extent, it may also allow for therapeutic alterations of the gut microbiota in order to alter response to certain dietary components. This article is the second in a 2-part review of the current research in the field of precision nutrition incorporating the gut microbiota into studies investigating interindividual variability in response to diet. Part I reviews the methods used by researchers to design and carry out such studies as well as analyze the results subsequently obtained.

31022973,"Precision Nutrition and the Microbiome, Part I: Current State of the Science.","The gut microbiota is a highly complex community which evolves and adapts to its host over a lifetime. It has been described as a virtual organ owing to the myriad of functions it performs, including the production of bioactive metabolites, regulation of immunity, energy homeostasis and protection against pathogens. These activities are dependent on the quantity and quality of the microbiota alongside its metabolic potential, which are dictated by a number of factors, including diet and host genetics. In this regard, the gut microbiome is malleable and varies significantly from host to host. These two features render the gut microbiome a candidate 'organ' for the possibility of precision microbiomics - the use of the gut microbiome as a biomarker to predict responsiveness to specific dietary constituents to generate precision diets and interventions for optimal health. With this in mind, this two-part review investigates the current state of the science in terms of the influence of diet and specific dietary components on the gut microbiota and subsequent consequences for health status, along with opportunities to modulate the microbiota for improved health and the potential of the microbiome as a biomarker to predict responsiveness to dietary components. In particular, in Part I, we examine the development of the microbiota from birth and its role in health. We investigate the consequences of poor-quality diet in relation to infection and inflammation and discuss diet-derived microbial metabolites which negatively impact health.

There is suggestive evidence that environmental stimuli, such as dietary pattern, particularly during pregnancy and early life, but also in adult life, can induce changes in DNA methylation predisposing to obesity and related comorbidities. In this context, the DNA methylation marks of each individual have emerged not only as a promising tool for the prediction, screening, diagnosis, and prognosis of obesity and metabolic syndrome features, but also for the improvement of weight loss therapies in the context of precision nutrition.

Despite outstanding technological progresses, genetics alone is not able to completely explain phenotypes, in particular for complex diseases. Given the existence of a ""missing heritability"", growing attention has been given to non-mendelian mechanisms of inheritance and to the role of the environment. The study of interaction between gene and environment represents a challenging but also a promising field with high potential for health prevention, and epigenetics has been suggested as one of the best candidate to mediate environmental effects on the genome. Among environmental factors able to interact with both genome and epigenome, nutrition is one of the most impacting. Not just our genome influences the responsiveness to food and nutrients, but vice versa, nutrition can also modify gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms. In this complex picture, nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics represent appealing disciplines aimed to define new prospectives of personalized nutrition.

Therefore, the characteristics (including sex) of an individual have to be taken into account as well as a series of omics markers. The results of nutritional genomics studies are crucial to generate the evidence needed so that precision nutrition can be applied. Although sex is one of the fundamental variables for making recommendations, at present, the nutritional genomics studies undertaken have not analyzed, systematically and with a gender perspective, the heterogeneity/homogeneity in gene-diet interactions on the different phenotypes studied, thus there is little information available on this issue and needs to be improved. Here we argue for the need to incorporate the gender perspective in nutritional genomics studies, present the general context, analyze the differences between sex and gender, as well as the limitations to measuring them and to detecting specific sex-gene or sex-phenotype associations, both at the specific gene level or in genome-wide-association studies.

Precision nutrition (PN) has emerged to translate discoveries about diversity in nutrient metabolism between subgroups and the inter-individual variability in the responses to dietary interventions. The overarching goals of PN are to deliver individualized, actionable dietary therapy based on an individual's nutritional phenotype, created from the integration of genetics, metabolic profile, and environmental factors in order to prevent and treat chronic disease.

However, evidence suggests that the health benefits of VE go far beyond that of an antioxidant acting in lipophilic environments. In humans, VE is channeled toward pathways dealing with lipoproteins and cholesterol, underlining its relevance in lipid handling and metabolism. In this context, both VE intake and status may be relevant in physiopathological conditions associated with disturbances in lipid metabolism or concomitant with oxidative stress, such as obesity. However, dietary reference values for VE in obese populations have not yet been defined, and VE supplementation trials show contradictory results. Therefore, a better understanding of the role of genetic variants in genes involved in VE metabolism may be crucial to exert dietary recommendations with a higher degree of precision. In particular, genetic variability should be taken into account in targets concerning VE bioavailability per se or concomitant with impaired lipoprotein transport. Genetic variants associated with impaired VE liver balance, and the handling/resolution of oxidative stress might also be relevant, but the core information that exists at present is insufficient to deliver precise recommendations.",Galmés S; Serra F; Palou A,Nutrients,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30518135/,1,0,0,0,0,0
29954131,Intake of Dietary One-Carbon Metabolism-Related B Vitamins and the Risk of Esophageal Cancer: A Dose-Response Meta-Analysis.,"Several B vitamins are essential in the one-carbon metabolism pathway, which is central to DNA methylation, synthesis, and repair. Moreover, an imbalance in this pathway has been linked to certain types of cancers. Here, we performed a meta-analysis in order to investigate the relationship between the intake of four dietary one-carbon metabolism-related B vitamins (B2, B6, folate, and B12) and the risk of esophageal cancer (EC). We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase for relevant studies published through 1 March 2018. The odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the highest versus the lowest level of each dietary B vitamin was then calculated. From 21 articles reporting 26 studies including 6404 EC cases and 504,550 controls, we found an inverse correlation between the consumption of vitamin B6 and folate and the risk of EC; this association was specific to the US, Europe, and Australia, but was not found in Asia. A dose-response analysis revealed that each 100 &mu;g/day increase in folate intake reduced the risk of EC by 12%. Moreover, each 1 mg/day increase in vitamin B6 intake decreased the risk of EC by 16%. Surprisingly, we found that each 1 &mu;g/day increase in vitamin B12 intake increased the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma by 2%, particularly in the US and Europe, suggesting both geographic and histological differences. Together, our results suggest that an increased intake of one-carbon metabolism-related B vitamins may protect against EC, with the exception of vitamin B12, which should be consumed in moderation.",Qiang Y; Li Q; Xin Y; Fang X; Tian Y; Ma J; Wang J; Wang Q; Zhang R; Wang J; Wang F,Nutrients,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29954131/,1,0,0,1,0,0
29433995,Precision nutrition for prevention and management of type 2 diabetes.,"Precision nutrition aims to prevent and manage chronic diseases by tailoring dietary interventions or recommendations to one or a combination of an individual's genetic background, metabolic profile, and environmental exposures. Recent advances in genomics, metabolomics, and gut microbiome technologies have offered opportunities as well as challenges in the use of precision nutrition to prevent and manage type 2 diabetes. Nutrigenomics studies have identified genetic variants that influence intake and metabolism of specific nutrients and predict individuals' variability in response to dietary interventions. Metabolomics has revealed metabolomic fingerprints of food and nutrient consumption and uncovered new metabolic pathways that are potentially modified by diet. Dietary interventions have been successful in altering abundance, composition, and activity of gut microbiota that are relevant for food metabolism and glycaemic control. In addition, mobile apps and wearable devices facilitate real-time assessment of dietary intake and provide feedback which can improve glycaemic control and diabetes management. By integrating these technologies with big data analytics, precision nutrition has the potential to provide personalised nutrition guidance for more effective prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. Despite these technological advances, much research is needed before precision nutrition can be widely used in clinical and public health settings. Currently, the field of precision nutrition faces challenges including a lack of robust and reproducible results, the high cost of omics technologies, and methodological issues in study design as well as high-dimensional data analyses and interpretation. Evidence is needed to support the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and additional benefits of precision nutrition beyond traditional nutrition intervention approaches. Therefore, we should manage unrealistically high expectations and balance the emerging field of precision nutrition with public health nutrition strategies to improve diet quality and prevent type 2 diabetes and its complications.",Wang DD; Hu FB,The lancet.

These <i>n</i>-6 and <i>n</i>-3 LC-PUFAs and their metabolites (ex, eicosanoids and endocannabinoids) play critical signaling and structural roles in almost all physiologic and pathophysiologic processes. This review summarizes: (1) the biosynthesis, metabolism and roles of LC-PUFAs; (2) the potential impact of rapidly altering the intake of dietary LA and ALA; (3) the genetics and evolution of LC-PUFA biosynthesis; (4) Gene-diet interactions that may lead to excess levels of <i>n</i>-6 LC-PUFAs and deficiencies of <i>n</i>-3 LC-PUFAs; and (5) opportunities for precision nutrition approaches to personalize <i>n</i>-3 LC-PUFA supplementation for individuals and populations. The rapid nature of transitions in 18C-PUFA exposure together with the genetic variation in the LC-PUFA biosynthetic pathway found in different populations make mal-adaptations a likely outcome of our current nutritional environment. Understanding this genetic variation in the context of 18C-PUFA dietary exposure should enable the development of individualized <i>n</i>-3 LC-PUFA supplementation regimens to prevent and manage human disease.",Chilton FH; Dutta R; Reynolds LM; Sergeant S; Mathias RA; Seeds MC,Nutrients,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29068398/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28956850,Precision Nutrition for Targeting Lipid Metabolism in Colorectal Cancer.,"Cancer is a multistage and multifactorial condition with genetic and environmental factors modulating tumorogenesis and disease progression. Nevertheless, cancer is preventable, as one third of cancer deaths could be avoided by modifying key risk factors. Nutrients can directly affect fundamental cellular processes and are considered among the most important risk factors in colorectal cancer (CRC). Red and processed meat, poultry consumption, fiber, and folate are the best-known diet components that interact with colorectal cancer susceptibility. In addition, the direct association of an unhealthy diet with obesity and dysbiosis opens new routes in the understanding of how daily diet nutrients could influence cancer prognosis. In the ""omics"" era, traditional nutrition has been naturally evolved to precision nutrition where technical developments have contributed to a more accurate discipline. In this sense, genomic and transcriptomic studies have been extensively used in precision nutrition approaches. However, the relation between CRC carcinogenesis and nutrition factors is more complex than originally expected. Together with classical diet-nutrition-related genes, nowadays, lipid-metabolism-related genes have acquired relevant interest in precision nutrition studies. Lipids regulate very diverse cellular processes from ATP synthesis and the activation of essential cell-signaling pathways to membrane organization and plasticity. Therefore, a wide range of tumorogenic steps can be influenced by lipid metabolism, both in primary tumours and distal metastasis. The extent to which genetic variants, together with the intake of specific dietary components, affect the risk of CRC is currently under investigation, and new therapeutic or preventive applications must be explored in CRC models. In this review, we will go in depth into the study of co-occurring events, which orchestrate CRC tumorogenesis and are essential for the evolution of precision nutrition paradigms. Likewise, we will discuss the application of precision nutrition approaches to target lipid metabolism in CRC.",Aguirre-Portolés C; Fernández LP; Ramírez de Molina A,Nutrients,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28956850/,1,0,0,0,0,0

We include investigations that demonstrate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms with obesity phenotypes and their influence on weight loss after bariatric surgery. We also present reports on how significant weight loss induced by bariatric surgery impacts telomere length, and we discuss studies on the existence of an epigenetic signature associated with surgery outcomes and specific gene methylation profile, which may help to predict weight loss after a surgical procedure. Finally, we show articles which evidence that bariatric surgery may affect expression of numerous genes involved in different metabolic pathways and consequently induce functional and taxonomic changes in gut microbial communities. The role nutritional genomics plays in responses to weight loss after bariatric surgery is evident. Better understanding of the molecular pathways involved in this process is necessary for successful weight management and maintenance.",Nicoletti CF; Cortes-Oliveira C; Pinhel MAS; Nonino CB,Nutrients,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28878180/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28829397,Precision Nutrition: A Review of Personalized Nutritional Approaches for the Prevention and Management of Metabolic Syndrome.,"The translation of the growing increase of findings emerging from basic nutritional science into meaningful and clinically relevant dietary advices represents nowadays one of the main challenges of clinical nutrition. From nutrigenomics to deep phenotyping, many factors need to be taken into account in designing personalized and unbiased nutritional solutions for individuals or population sub-groups. Likewise, a concerted effort among basic, clinical scientists and health professionals will be needed to establish a comprehensive framework allowing the implementation of these new findings at the population level. In a world characterized by an overwhelming increase in the prevalence of obesity and associated metabolic disturbances, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, tailored nutrition prescription represents a promising approach for both the prevention and management of metabolic syndrome. This review aims to discuss recent works in the field of precision nutrition analyzing most relevant aspects affecting an individual response to lifestyle/nutritional interventions. Latest advances in the analysis and monitoring of dietary habits, food behaviors, physical activity/exercise and deep phenotyping will be discussed, as well as the relevance of novel applications of nutrigenomics, metabolomics and microbiota profiling. Recent findings in the development of precision nutrition are highlighted. Finally, results from published studies providing examples of new avenues to successfully implement innovative precision nutrition approaches will be reviewed.",de Toro-Martín J; Arsenault BJ; Després JP; Vohl MC,Nutrients,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28829397/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28689206,"Guide for Current Nutrigenetic, Nutrigenomic, and Nutriepigenetic Approaches for Precision Nutrition Involving the Prevention and Management of Chronic Diseases Associated with Obesity.","Chronic diseases, including obesity, are major causes of morbidity and mortality in most countries. The adverse impacts of obesity and associated comorbidities on health remain a major concern due to the lack of effective interventions for prevention and management. Precision nutrition is an emerging therapeutic approach that takes into account an individual's genetic and epigenetic information, as well as age, gender, or particular physiopathological status. Advances in genomic sciences are contributing to a better understanding of the role of genetic variants and epigenetic signatures as well as gene expression patterns in the development of diverse chronic conditions, and how they may modify therapeutic responses. This knowledge has led to the search for genetic and epigenetic biomarkers to predict the risk of developing chronic diseases and personalizing their prevention and treatment. Additionally, original nutritional interventions based on nutrients and bioactive dietary compounds that can modify epigenetic marks and gene expression have been implemented. Although caution must be exercised, these scientific insights are paving the way for the design of innovative strategies for the control of chronic diseases accompanying obesity. This document provides a number of examples of the huge potential of understanding nutrigenetic, nutrigenomic, and nutriepigenetic roles in precision nutrition.",Ramos-Lopez O; Milagro FI; Allayee H; Chmurzynska A; Choi MS; Curi R; De Caterina R; Ferguson LR; Goni L; Kang JX; Kohlmeier M; Marti A; Moreno LA; Pérusse L; Prasad C; Qi L; Reifen R; Riezu-Boj JI; San-Cristobal R; Santos JL; Martínez JA,Journal of nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28689206/,0,0,0,0,0,0
28684688,Gene-Dairy Food Interactions and Health Outcomes: A Review of Nutrigenetic Studies.,"Each person differs from the next by an average of over 3 million genetic variations in their DNA. This genetic diversity is responsible for many of the interindividual differences in food preferences, nutritional needs, and dietary responses between humans. The field of nutrigenetics aims to utilize this type of genetic information in order to personalize diets for optimal health. One of the most well-studied genetic variants affecting human dietary patterns and health is the lactase persistence mutation, which enables an individual to digest milk sugar into adulthood. Lactase persistence is one of the most influential Mendelian factors affecting human dietary patterns to occur since the beginning of the Neolithic Revolution. However, the lactase persistence mutation is only one of many mutations that can influence the relationship between dairy intake and disease risk. The purpose of this review is to summarize the available nutrigenetic literature investigating the relationships between genetics, dairy intake, and health outcomes. Nonetheless, the understanding of an individual's nutrigenetic responses is just one component of personalized nutrition. In addition to nutrigenetic responses, future studies should also take into account nutrigenomic responses (epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic), and phenotypic/characteristic traits (age, gender, activity level, disease status, etc.), as these factors all interact with diet to influence health.",Comerford KB; Pasin G,Nutrients,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28684688/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28387720,Gene-Diet Interaction and Precision Nutrition in Obesity.,"The rapid rise of obesity during the past decades has coincided with a profound shift of our living environment, including unhealthy dietary patterns, a sedentary lifestyle, and physical inactivity. Genetic predisposition to obesity may have interacted with such an obesogenic environment in determining the obesity epidemic. Growing studies have found that changes in adiposity and metabolic response to low-calorie weight loss diets might be modified by genetic variants related to obesity, metabolic status and preference to nutrients. This review summarized data from recent studies of gene-diet interactions, and discussed integration of research of metabolomics and gut microbiome, as well as potential application of the findings in precision nutrition.",Heianza Y; Qi L,International journal of molecular sciences,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28387720/,1,0,0,0,0,0
28337931,Utilizing nutritional genomics to tailor diets for the prevention of cardiovascular disease: a guide for upcoming studies and implementations.,"Personalized diets based on an individual's genome to optimize the success of dietary intervention and reduce genetic cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, is one of the challenges most frequently discussed in the scientific community. Areas covered: The authors gathered literature-based evidence on nutritional genomics and CVD phenotypes, our own results and research experience to provide a critical overview of the current situation of using nutritional genomics to tailor diets for CVD prevention and to propose guidelines for future studies and implementations. Expert commentary: Hundreds of studies on gene-diet interactions determining CVD intermediate (plasma lipids, hypertension, etc.) and final phenotypes (stroke, etc.) have furnished top-level scientific evidence for claiming that the genetic effect in cardiovascular risk is not deterministic, but can be modified by diet. However, despite the many results obtained, there are still gaps in practically applying a personalized diet design to specific genotypes. Hence, a better systemization and methodological improvement of new studies is required to obtain top-level evidence that will allow their application in the future precision nutrition/medicine. The authors propose several recommendations for tackling new approaches and applications.",Corella D; Coltell O; Mattingley G; Sorlí JV; Ordovas JM,Expert review of molecular diagnostics,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28337931/,1,0,0,0,0,0
