41496202,"Resistance-based training improves mitochondrial capacity and redox balance in aging adults, independent of polyphenol supplementation.","Aging is associated with declines in skeletal muscle function, mitochondrial capacity, and changes in redox balance, which collectively contribute to frailty and chronic disease risk. This study investigated the effects of a 12-week resistance training (RT) program combined with a small dose of high-intensity interval training (HIIT), with or without polyphenol supplementation, on mitochondrial respiratory capacity (MRC) and oxidative stress in middle-aged and older adults (55-70 years). Forty-one participants were randomized to receive either a polyphenol supplement or a placebo for 30 days before the training intervention. Following the training intervention, aerobic capacity, lean mass, and strength improved significantly in both groups. Training also increased MRC in the placebo group but not in the polyphenol group, which displayed higher MRC following the supplementation phase, possibly reflecting either a supplement effect or baseline variation. The training resulted in a 20 % decrease in skeletal muscle H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> emission across both groups, suggesting enhanced mitochondrial efficiency or antioxidant defenses. However, gene expression of selected antioxidants was unchanged, and plasma oxidative stress markers malondialdehyde (MDA) increased, and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) remained unchanged. Circulating antioxidants showed distinct changes with training, as ascorbic acid increased with training in both groups, while α-tocopherol increased only in the placebo group and β-cryptoxanthin and retinol declined in the polyphenol group, suggesting potential supplement-nutrient interactions. Uric acid increased in both groups, likely reflecting exercise-induced purine turnover. In conclusion, combined RT and HIIT improved mitochondrial bioenergetics and muscle redox balance in middle-aged and older adults, whereas polyphenol supplementation did not augment these adaptations and may have blunted some vitamin-related responses. These findings underscore resistance-based exercise as a potent intervention for maintaining physical and mitochondrial health with age.",Flensted-Jensen M; Weinreich CM; Kleis-Olsen AS; Hansen F; Skyggelund NS; Pii JR; Whitlock R; Karlsen A; Ingersen A; Reihmane D; Weber D; Grune T; Pivovarova-Ramich O; Dela F,Redox biology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41496202/,0,0,0,0,1,0
41466265,"China precision nutrition biobank: protocol of a prospective cohort study on diet, human phenotype/genotype, and early-onset chronic diseases.","The global burden of early-onset chronic diseases, especially early-onset type 2 diabetes, is increasing, particularly in China. Diet is a key factor and emerging evidence highlights substantial inter-individual variability in metabolic responses to diets, highlighting the need for precision nutrition. The China Precision Nutrition Biobank (CPNB) is a prospective, longitudinal, cohort study designed to investigate diet-phenotype/genotype interactions and develop precision dietary strategies for early prevention and intervention of chronic diseases, with a particular focus on early-onset diseases. CPNB consists of three phases: the alpha (pilot cohort), beta (transition cohort), and gamma (main cohort) phases. Approximately 200, 1450, and 20,000 adults aged 18-40 years from urban and rural areas in China including Beijing, one city each in Heilongjiang, Shandong, Zhejiang, Guangxi, and Hainan provinces, and one or more villages each in Henan, Gansu, Sichuan, Zhejiang, and Hunan provinces will be recruited during the alpha, beta, and gamma phases, respectively, between 2025 and 2035. Sociodemographic information, medical records, read-time weighed food records and corresponding continuous glucose monitor (CGM) readings, objective physical activity, food challenges, genes, gut and oral microbiota, metabolites from blood, stool, urine, saliva, and hair, and questionnaires will be collected at baseline survey. The follow-up survey will be conducted every five years to repeat these assessments until participants' death (the follow-up period may extend up to 80 years). Outcomes of interest are common early- and late-onset chronic diseases and their preclinical stages. The CPNB data can be used to develop prediction models for personalized metabolic responses and risks of early-onset chronic diseases among Chinese people. It will also provide new evidence on interactions of diet with human phenotypes/genotypes during preclinical stage, onset, and progression of early-onset diseases. CPNB aims to inform the development of precision nutrition strategies aligned with the principles of predictive, personalized, preventive, and participatory medicine in the Chinese population. CPNB was registered at Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ( http://www.chictr.org.cn/ ) on June 3rd, 2025, under the registration number ChiCTR2500103621.",He J; Xie M; Liu J; Dong Y; Chen H; Wang R; Xu W; Li K; Fan Z; Martinez JA; Raben A; Ren F; Guo J; Zhu R,Nutrition journal,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41466265/,0,0,0,0,0,1
41404613,"Gut metabolism links precision nutrition, exercise, and healthspan in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>.","Longevity-promoting interventions commonly entail functional trade-offs, raising the unresolved question of whether lifespan extension necessarily compromises physiological performance. Here, utilizing a chemically defined diet (CDD) in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, we systematically evaluated a multimodal intervention combining methionine restriction (MR), taurine supplementation (Tau), and moderate exercise. This combinatorial approach synergistically extended lifespan, preserved reproductive capacity, and improved locomotor function. Integrative targeted metabolomics and stable isotope tracing revealed increased mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux and enhanced redox homeostasis in the gut as central metabolic features. Notably, <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> was identified as a key microbial mediator responsive to dietary and behavioral stimuli, potentially coordinating host energy metabolism and maintaining physiological integrity. Together, these observations outline a ""nutrition-behavior-microbiota"" framework that uncouples the traditional trade-off between lifespan and functional health, offering new perspectives for promoting healthy aging.",Wei F; Liu S; Sun Y; Liu J,bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41404613/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41176812,From prediction of personalized metabolic responses to foods to computational nutrition: Concepts of an emerging interdisciplinary field.,"Recent advances in artificial intelligence, wearable biosensors, and multi-omics technologies, combined with interdisciplinary translational collaborations, are transforming the landscape of nutrition, particularly by enabling precision nutrition. We propose computational nutrition as an emerging interdisciplinary field that aims to address complex challenges in nutrition and health and drive paradigm shifts in nutrition research through computational methods in statistics and computer science (e.g., statistical modeling, simulation, causal inference, machine learning, and deep learning) and multi-modal data. Computational nutrition employs epidemiology and data science as its methodologies and integrates expertise from nutrition, food science, computer science, statistics, systems biology, and public health. The main research directions of computational nutrition are: 1) prediction of personalized metabolic responses to foods and establishment of individualized dietary reference intakes; 2) causal inference in nutrition and diseases and evaluation of individualized treatment effects of nutritional interventions; 3) precise and dynamic assessment and monitoring of diet-related disease risks; 4) simulation and evaluation of public health nutrition policies and sustainability assessment of dietary patterns. Critical challenges such as the reliability of wearable biosensors, trade-offs in feature selection, ethics of algorithms and health equity, and interpretability of algorithms are raised, which must be addressed to ensure human well-being and rights.",Zhu R; Dong Y; Guo J; He J; Chen H; Wang R; Ren F; Raben A; Martinez JA,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41176812/,0,0,0,0,0,0
41094026,Long-term effects of dietary protein and carbohydrate quality on prediabetes remission: results from the PREVIEW randomised multinational diabetes prevention trial.,"Recent studies advocate prediabetes remission as a goal in diabetes prevention, but the optimal dietary composition for prediabetes remission over the long term is unknown. We aimed to examine the long-term effects on prediabetes remission of a prudent diet with moderate protein and a moderate glycaemic index (GI) (akin to general dietary guidelines) vs a high-protein, low-GI diet. This study is a secondary analysis of PREVIEW, which is a 3 year, multicentre, parallel, randomised trial. Adults with overweight/obesity (BMI ≥ 25 and <30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or BMI ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively) and prediabetes (fasting glucose 5.6-6.9 mmol/l and/or 2 h glucose 7.8-11.0 mmol/l determined using an OGTT) were recruited. Eligible participants underwent an 8-week rapid weight loss programme comprising a low-energy diet, followed by a 3 year weight maintenance phase comprising lifestyle intervention. At baseline, participants were randomly assigned to a high-protein (25% of energy from protein), low-GI (GI<50) diet, or a prudent diet with moderate protein (15% of energy from protein) and moderate GI (GI>56). The primary outcome of the current analysis was the number of participants who achieved prediabetes remission (i.e. a return to normal fasting glucose and normal glucose tolerance) at 1 year or 3 years. Secondary outcomes were changes in body weight and composition over 3 years (continuous variables) and maintenance of a ≥8% weight loss target (binary variable). Modified intention-to-treat analyses were performed on all participants who received the dietary intervention (n=1856). Risk ratios and 95% CI for prediabetes remission and maintaining the weight loss target in each diet group were estimated using multilevel modified Poisson regression adjusted for age and sex. Linear mixed models were used to estimate the dietary effects on changes in body weight and composition. The moderate-protein, moderate-GI group (n=923) had a higher rate of remission than the high-protein, low-GI group (n=933) at both 1 year (rate of remission 26.3% vs 20.7%; RR 1.26; 95% CI 1.04, 1.53; p=0.025) and 3 years (20.6% vs 15.5%; RR 1.26; 95% CI 1.06, 1.50; p=0.015). However, body weight and composition changes were similar for participants on the moderate-protein, moderate-GI vs high-protein, low-GI diet at 1 year (54.0% vs 57.3% of participants met the weight loss maintenance target [≥8% of initial body weight]; p=0.215) and 3 years (31.4% vs 30.4%, respectively; p=0.793). The differences in remission rates of the two dietary patterns were independent of body weight and composition changes. Following rapid weight loss, a prudent diet with moderate protein and moderate GI was more effective for long-term prediabetes remission than a high-protein, low-GI diet, irrespective of weight change.

40854218,Comparison of an Energy-Reduced Mediterranean Diet and Physical Activity Versus an Ad Libitum Mediterranean Diet in the Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes : A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Limited research has been done to evaluate the combined effect of energy reduction, Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), and physical activity on type 2 diabetes incidence. To evaluate whether an energy-reduced MedDiet (erMedDiet) plus physical activity reduces diabetes incidence compared with a standard MedDiet. Prespecified secondary outcome analysis in the PREDIMED (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea)-Plus randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial. (ISRCTN Registry: ISRCTN89898870). 23 centers across Spain. 4746 adults aged 55 to 75 years with metabolic syndrome and overweight or obesity, without prior cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to an intervention group receiving an erMedDiet (planned reduction of 600 kcal per day), increased physical activity, and behavioral strategies for reducing weight, or a control group receiving ad libitum MedDiet advice. Diabetes incidence was based on the American Diabetes Association criteria. Anthropometric measurements were obtained annually. Cox regression models were used to assess the intervention effect. The 6-year absolute risk was 12.0% (95% CI, 11.9% to 12.1%) in the control group (349 cases) and 9.5% (CI, 9.4% to 9.5%) in the intervention group (280 cases). Over a median 6-year follow-up, diabetes incidence was 31% (CI, 18% to 41%) relatively lower in the intervention group compared with the control group, with an absolute risk reduction of -2.6 cases (CI, -2.7 to -2.4) per 1000 person-years. The intervention group attained better adherence to the erMedDiet, higher physical activity levels, and greater reductions in body weight and waist circumference. Secondary outcome, single-blinded design, and self-reported dietary adherence. An intensive intervention with the MedDiet adding caloric reduction, physical activity, and modest weight loss was more effective than only an ad libitum MedDiet in reducing diabetes incidence in overweight/obese persons with metabolic syndrome.

40777169,The relationship between carotenoids and diabetic nephropathy: insights from NHANES.,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) poses significant health risks and imposes a substantial global disease burden. The association between carotenoid intake and DN remains unclear. Utilizing data from the 2007-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), this study investigates the relationship between multiple carotenoid subtypes and DN, aiming to inform exploratory insights for potential preventive strategies. This cross-sectional analysis utilized NHANES 2007-2018 data with a multistage stratified sampling design. After a four-stage screening process, baseline participants were selected by excluding individuals with lacking diabetes-related data, pregnant women, and those with incomplete carotenoid intake or DN diagnostic records. Model 1 included 25,483 participants, while Model 2 comprised retained 13,271 participants after further adjustment for covariates (demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, clinical indicators, and socioeconomic parameters). Dietary intake of six carotenoid subtypes (<i>α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, Lycopene, Lutein, Zeaxanthin</i>) was calculated using as the mean of two standardized 24-h dietary recalls. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was diagnosed based on fasting plasma glucose (≥126 mg/dL), HbA1c (≥6.5%), hypoglycemic medication use, or clinical diagnosis. DN was defined as a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥ 30 mg/g or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> in T2DM patients. Statistical analyses employed weighted multivariable logistic regression using the R survey package, adjusting for sampling design and covariates. Associations were quantified as odds ratios (ORs per 10 μg/d carotenoid intake) with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons. The significance threshold was set at <i>α</i> = 0.05. This NHANES-based study revealed nonlinear associations between dietary carotenoids and diabetic nephropathy (DN) risk, with notable gender-and ethnicity-specific gender/ethnicity-specific effects. Univariate analysis demonstrated elevated DN risk with higher β-cryptoxanthin intake (OR = 1.413, 95% CI), though significance was attenuated dissipated after multivariable adjustment, suggesting confounding mediation by obesity and hypertension. Multivariable models identified threshold effects: the low <i>α</i>-carotene intake group exhibited a 75% reduced risk (OR = 0.25, 95% CI), while the high-intake group showed a paradoxical risk elevation (OR = 2.24, 95% CI). β-Carotene displayed gender-divergent effects, with the highest tertile significantly reducing risk in males by 43% (OR = 0.57, 95% CI). Interaction models highlighted intensified <i>α</i>-carotene protection in males and Non-Hispanic White (OR = 0.27-0.29), whereas lycopene correlated with a fivefold increased DN risk in Non-Hispanic Black (OR = 4.99, 95% CI). Cardinal risk factors included advanced age (OR = 1.06/year), obesity (OR = 1.07/BMI unit), male sex (OR = 3.05), and hypertension (OR = 4.7), while higher education (OR = 0.72) and moderate alcohol consumption exerted inversely associated effects. These findings underscore the necessity of integrating nutrient thresholds (e.g., <i>α</i>-carotene optimization) and social determinants into DN prevention, though racial subgroup analyses warrant validation through prospective cohorts due to sample size constraints. Clinicians managing DN should: Prioritize Consider <i>α</i>-carotene's biphasic dose-response relationship, prioritizing intake within the optimal dosage window; Utilize Leverage β-carotene's gender-specific benefits for male patients; Exercise caution in consider exploringing lycopene-rich dietary interventions diets for African American populations. Public health initiatives should incorporate nutrient-gender-ethnicity triadic assessments into DN education programs to advance precision nutrition guidelines.",Wang L; Feng T; Tan Y; Zhang J; Zhang T; Huo J; Song X; Lin X; Li M; Liang W; Ding Q,Frontiers in nutrition,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40777169/,0,0,0,0,0,1
40771529,Effect of anti-inflammatory diets on health-related quality of life in adults with chronic disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"To evaluate the effectiveness of anti-inflammatory diets on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in adults with at least one chronic disease. Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science and the Cochrane Centre Register of Controlled Trials from inception to 6 May 2024. Full-text RCTs published in English assessing the effectiveness of any anti-inflammatory dietary intervention (ie, a diet that emphasises the intake of nutrient-rich, minimally processed foods rich in polyphenols, carotenoids and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and limits highly-processed, pro-inflammatory foods) on HRQOL in adults with at least one chronic disease were included. Data extraction, risk-of-bias assessments and strength-of-evidence assessments were done by two independent reviewers. Pooled effects (standardised mean difference (SMD)) for HRQOL (separated into mental and physical component scores wherever possible) were calculated using random effects models with restricted maximum likelihood estimations. Subgroup analyses and meta-regressions were performed to assess the influence of study-level characteristics on HRQOL outcomes. 23 studies reporting HRQOL for 3294 participants were included. The most common chronic diseases were type two diabetes, musculoskeletal conditions and cardiovascular conditions. Anti-inflammatory diets were associated with small improvements in HRQOL physical component scores compared with usual care/other dietary interventions (18 trials, SMD=0.17, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.27) but not in mental component scores (18 trials, SMD=0.09, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.20) or general HRQOL scores (four trials, SMD=0.27, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.77). Pooled effects did not differ by available study-level characteristics; however, diet-only interventions (compared with multi-component interventions) had a greater effect on mental component scores. No study met the Cochrane criteria for low risk of bias. Certainty of evidence was low for physical and mental HRQOL scores and very low for general HRQOL scores. In adults with at least one chronic disease, anti-inflammatory diets lead to small improvements in physical component HRQOL, which may not be clinically relevant. No effect was found on the mental component or general HRQOL. Further high-quality RCTs may change this conclusion.",Law L; Heerey JJ; Devlin BL; Brukner P; De Livera AM; Kemp J; Attanayake A; Skou ST; Bricca A; Culvenor AG,"BMJ nutrition, prevention & health",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40771529/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40732463,Towards Precision Nutrition: A Novel Smartphone-Connected Biosensor for Point-of-Care Detection of β-Hydroxybutyrate in Human Blood and Saliva.,"Precision nutrition is an emerging approach that tailors dietary recommendations based on an individual's unique genetic, metabolic, microbiome, and lifestyle factors. β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB) is a key ketone body produced during fat metabolism, especially in states of fasting, low-carbohydrate intake, or prolonged exercise. Therefore, monitoring β-HB levels provides valuable insights into an individual's metabolic state, making it an essential biomarker for precision and personalized nutrition. A smartphone-connected electrochemical biosensor for single-use, rapid, low-cost, accurate, and selective detection of β-HB in whole blood and saliva at the Point-of-Care (POC) is reported. A graphite screen-printed carbon electrode modified with potassium ferricyanide (Fe(III)GSPE) was used as an electrode platform for the deposition of β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidized form (NAD<sup>+</sup>), and chitosan nanoparticles (ChitNPs). An outer poly(vinyl) chloride (PVC) diffusion-limiting membrane was used to protect the modified electrode. The biosensor showed a linear range in the clinically relevant range, between 0.4 and 8 mM, with a detection limit (LOD) of 0.1 mM. The biosensor was tested on human blood and saliva samples, and the results were compared to those obtained with a commercial ketone meter, showing excellent agreement.",Tortolini C; Caprio M; Gianfrilli D; Lenzi A; Antiochia R,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40732463/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40393616,"Subgroup differences in calcium metabolism in response to dietary sodium: Rationale, design, and methods of a randomized, controlled, crossover dietary intervention in healthy adults.","The growing interest in personalized nutrition stems from a deeper understanding of subgroup differences in response to environmental factors, including diet. Preliminary evidence in Black and White adolescent girls showed that Black girls retain more calcium and excrete more sodium compared to White girls on a high sodium diet. However, little is known about calcium absorption efficiency across other races or age groups. This report outlines the rationale and design of a planned randomized controlled trial aimed at investigating calcium absorption and calcium and sodium excretion in response to diets high (typical Western diet) and low (recommended) in sodium in Black, White, Hispanic, and Asian adults. It is hypothesized that fractional calcium absorption and urinary sodium excretion will vary by subgroup, with Blacks predicted to have the highest rates and Whites the lowest, and intermediate responses in Hispanics and Asians. Participants will undergo two 2-day dietary intervention arms, with biospecimen collection following each arm. Primary outcomes include fractional calcium absorption and urinary calcium excretion, and secondary outcomes comprise urinary sodium excretion and blood pressure.

40284242,Influence of Genetic Polymorphisms and Biochemical Biomarkers on Response to Nutritional Iron Supplementation and Performance in a Professional Football Team: A Pilot Longitudinal Study.,"Iron deficiency is a prevalent issue among elite athletes, particularly in endurance-based sports like football, where optimal iron status is crucial for aerobic capacity and performance. Despite the well-documented role of iron in oxygen transport and energy metabolism, the interplay between genetic polymorphisms, biochemical markers, and iron supplementation remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between genetic polymorphisms and iron status in professional football players, assess the impact of iron supplementation on athletic performance, and develop a predictive model for iron supplementation based on genetic and biochemical profiles. A longitudinal study was conducted over three seasons (2021-2024) with 48 male professional football players. Participants underwent genotyping for polymorphisms in <i>ACE</i> (rs4646994), ACTN3 (rs1815739), <i>AMPD1</i> (rs17602729), <i>CKM</i> (rs8111989), <i>HFE</i> (rs1799945), and <i>MLCK</i> (rs2700352, rs28497577). Biochemical markers (ferritin, haemoglobin, haematocrit, serum iron) and performance metrics (GPS-derived data) were monitored. Iron supplementation (105 mg/day ferrous sulphate) was administered to players with ferritin <30 ng/mL. A Total Genotype Score (TGS) was calculated to evaluate genetic predisposition. Players with ""optimal"" genotypes (<i>ACE</i> DD, <i>ACTN3</i> CC, <i>AMPD1</i> CC, <i>HFE</i> GC) required less iron supplementation (TGS = 51.25 vs. 41.32 a.u.; <i>p</i> = 0.013) and exhibited better performance metrics. Iron supplementation significantly improved haemoglobin and haematocrit in deficient players (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The TGS predicted supplementation need (AUC = 0.711; <i>p</i> = 0.023), with a threshold of 46.42 a.u. (OR = 5.23, 95% CI: 1.336-14.362; <i>p</i> = 0.017 for non-supplemented players). Furthermore, performance data revealed that iron-supplemented players had significantly lower competition time (1128.40 vs. 1972.84 min; <i>p</i> = 0.003), total distance covered (128,129.42 vs. 218,556.64 m; <i>p</i> = 0.005), and high-speed running in the 18-21 km/h (7.58 vs. 10.36 m/min; <i>p</i> = 0.007) and 21-24 km/h (4.43 vs. 6.13 m/min; <i>p</i> = 0.010) speed zones. They also started fewer matches (11.50 vs. 21.59; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Genetic profile combined with biochemical monitoring effectively predicts iron supplementation needs in athletes. Personalized nutrition strategies, guided by TGS, can optimize iron status and enhance performance in elite football players. This approach bridges a critical gap in sports science, offering a framework for precision nutrition in athletics.",Varillas-Delgado D,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40284242/,0,0,0,0,0,1
40259686,Cross-sectional associations between Mediterranean diet and body composition in preschool children. CORAL study.,"Overweight and obesity in children are rising globally, and the Mediterranean diet may help reduce obesity and related diseases. To assess the association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and body composition in Spanish preschool children. This study included 1218 children aged 3-6 years from the CORALS cohort. Mediterranean diet adherence was evaluated using the validated MED4CHILD and COME-Kids F&B-FQ questionnaires. Body composition measurements included weight, height, waist circumference, BMI, Fat Mass (FM), Fat-Free Mass Index (FFMI), and Waist-to-Height ratio (WtHR). Multivariate regression and ANCOVA were used to examine associations, adjusting for factors like age, physical activity, and energy intake. We also performed a Cohen's d analysis to assess effect size. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with more favourable body composition in children. Specifically, both the MED4CHILD score and the COME-Kids-derived score showed significant associations with BMI, FFMI, and Waist-to-Height ratio, showing differences by sex. Children who adhered to the Mediterranean diet exhibited lower BMI and higher fat-free mass, and a more favourable waist-to-height ratio. Additionally, although some measures showed weaker associations, all analyses highlighted a trend towards improved body composition with higher adherence. Cohen's d analysis showed small to moderate effect sizes. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was significantly linked to favorable body composition indices in Spanish children, highlighting the importance of promoting healthy dietary patterns to prevent overweight and obesity.",Larruy-García A; Miguel-Berges ML; Torre IR; Pastor-Villaescusa B; Leis R; Babio N; Navas-Carretero S; Corella D; Pérez A; Gil-Campos M; Picáns-Leis R; Garcia-Gavilán J; Flores-Barrante P; Martínez JA; Llorente-Cantarero FJ; Vázquez-Cobela R; Paz-Graniel I; Ayala-Marín AM; Jurado-Castro JM; de la Torre-Aguilar MJ; Gheorghita I; Moreno LA; De Miguel-Etayo P,Pediatric obesity,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40259686/,0,0,0,0,0,0

To evaluate the effects of a weight-loss lifestyle intervention on bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC), and low BMD prevalence. The 3-year, parallel-group Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea-Plus (PREDIMED-Plus) randomized clinical trial was conducted at recruiting centers in Spain from October 2013 to December 2016. Men and women (aged 55-75 years) with metabolic syndrome and overweight or obesity, as well as access to dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (from 4 centers in Navarra, Mallorca, Reus, and León), were included in this prespecified secondary analysis. The analysis was conducted from September 1 to October 30, 2024. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to the intervention or the control. The intervention group followed an energy-reduced Mediterranean diet and increased physical activity, whereas the control group was advised to follow an ad libitum Mediterranean diet with no physical activity promotion. BMD (total femur, lumbar spine [L1-L4], and femoral trochanter) and total BMC were measured using DXA at baseline and at 1 and 3 years of follow-up. T scores from BMD variables were determined, and osteopenia or osteoporosis status was defined as low BMD. Linear and logistic 2-level mixed models were used for main analyses including participants lost to follow-up. Intention-to-treat analysis, completers case analysis, and sensitivity analysis were additionally performed. This study included 924 older adults (mean [SD] age, 65.1 [5.0] years; 454 women [49.1%] and 470 men [50.9%]). Significant differences in mean changes between groups were observed, with an overall 3-year intervention increase in the intervention group (n = 460) compared with the control group (n = 464) in lumbar spine (L1-L4) BMD (between-group differences, -0.1 [95% CI, -0.8 to 0.8] g/cm2 after 1 year and 0.9 [95% CI, 0.1-1.8] g/cm2 after 3 years; overall P = .05). This protective association was observed for women (between-group differences, -0.1 [95% CI, -1.3 to 1.1] g/cm2 after 1 year and 1.8 [95% CI, 0.6-2.9] g/cm2 after 3 years; overall P = .005) but not for men. No overall 3-year intervention effect on total BMC and low BMD prevalence was observed. In the PREDIMED-Plus trial, an energy-reduced Mediterranean diet and physical activity lifestyle intervention mitigated weight loss- and age-related BMD decline among older women with metabolic syndrome compared with conventional ad libitum Mediterranean diet recommendations. Weight-loss lifestyle interventions with longer follow-up are warranted in the future to confirm these results in relation to bone health.

40176811,Amelioration of aging-induced muscular decline by black soybean (<i>Rhynchosia nulubilis</i>) and black rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) extracts.,"Aging leads to a decline in the mass and function of skeletal muscles, a condition known as sarcopenia. It was previously reported that aging-related alterations in protein degradation, chronic inflammation, and deterioration of mitochondrial metabolism affect the acceleration of muscle atrophy in the elderly. However, the detailed mechanism or substantial causes for age-related muscle loss are still lacking, yet exercise or an increment in dietary protein intake are suggested as effective approaches to mitigate muscle atrophy. This study aims to investigate the regulatory effect of black soybean (<i>Rhynchosia nulubilis</i>) and black rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) mixture extract (BBME), which are rich in protein and bioactive compounds, in 12-month-old aged mice and L6 myotubes. BBME was orally administered at 300 and 600 mg/kg/day (low and high doses) for 12 weeks, and its effects on systemic glucose homeostasis and skeletal muscle metabolism were evaluated. Consequently, BBME at a high dose marginally ameliorated muscle loss and significantly improved glucose metabolism. BBME also reduced cellular senescence markers and enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis in aged skeletal muscles. Additionally, BBME exerted insulin-like activity by promoting glucose metabolism in L6 myotubes. These findings suggest the potential of BBME as a functional food ingredient in alleviating aging-induced muscle loss by modulating mitochondrial activity and glucose metabolism.",Park H; Yu S; Kim W,Frontiers in immunology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40176811/,0,0,0,0,0,0
40077631,Study on the Differences in the Thirst-Quenching Effects of Different Beverages Supplemented Before Exercise: A Randomized Crossover Trial.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Different beverages may vary in their effectiveness at quenching thirst. This study aims to explore the impact of pre-exercise consumption of different types of beverages on thirst relief, providing scientific evidence to guide the selection of the most suitable beverage type. <b>Methods:</b> A randomized crossover design was used, recruiting 13 healthy male college students as participants. Each participant completed five exercise trials, with a 7-day interval between trials. In random order, participants consumed 6 mL/kg body weight of water, carbonated beverage, juice, electrolyte drink, or tea before exercise in each trial. Blood, saliva, and urine samples were collected before and after exercise; body weight was measured, and thirst sensation was recorded. <b>Results:</b> Body weight significantly decreased in all groups post-exercise (<i>p</i> < 0.05), with no significant differences between the beverage groups (<i>p</i> > 0.05). Post-exercise, serum Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations significantly decreased in all beverage groups, with the electrolyte drink group showing a significantly different change compared to the other groups (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Serum K<sup>+</sup> concentrations significantly increased post-exercise only in the electrolyte drink group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). No consistent trend was observed in the changes in serum Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations before and after exercise. Serum Cl<sup>-</sup> concentrations post-exercise were significantly lower than pre-exercise in all groups except the electrolyte drink group (Group E) (<i>p</i> < 0.05). All five hydration protocols resulted in a decrease in plasma volume. There was no consistent pattern in the changes in urine osmolality before and after exercise. Salivary osmolality significantly increased post-exercise in all groups (<i>p</i> < 0.05). In terms of subjective thirst, the water supplementation group had the highest score. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study indicates that electrolyte drinks are more effective in maintaining physiological balance, while water is most effective in alleviating subjective thirst. The impact of different beverages on subjective thirst did not fully align with changes in physiological markers, suggesting that future research should comprehensively evaluate the relationship between subjective sensations and physiological changes.",Gao J; Wang Y; Ren X; Nie Y; Li Y; Zhang Y; Huang S; Zhu D,Nutrients,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40077631/,0,0,0,0,1,0
39997062,The Human Energy Balance: Uncovering the Hidden Variables of Obesity.,"Obesity has emerged as a global epidemic, creating an increased burden of weight-related diseases and straining healthcare systems worldwide. While the fundamental principle of energy balance-caloric intake versus expenditure-remains central to weight regulation, real-world outcomes often deviate from simplistic predictions due to a multitude of physiological and environmental factors. Genetic predispositions, variations in basal metabolic rates, adaptive thermogenesis, physical activity, and nutrient losses via fecal and urinary excretion contribute to interindividual differences in energy homeostasis. Additionally, factors such as meal timing, macronutrient composition, gut microbiota dynamics, and diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) further modulate energy utilization and metabolic efficiency. This Perspective explores key physiological determinants of the energy balance, while also highlighting the clinical significance of thrifty versus spendthrifty metabolic phenotypes. Key strategies for individualized weight management include precision calorimetry, circadian-aligned meal timing, the use of protein- and whole food diets to enhance DIT, and increases in non-exercise activity, as well as mild cold exposure and the use of thermogenic agents (e.g., capsaicin-like compounds) to stimulate brown adipose tissue activity. A comprehensive, personalized approach to obesity management that moves beyond restrictive caloric models is essential to achieving sustainable weight control and improving long-term metabolic health. Integrating these multifactorial insights into clinical practice will enhance obesity treatment strategies, fostering more effective and enduring interventions.",Theodorakis N; Nikolaou M,"Diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39997062/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39952015,Associations of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome stages with premature mortality and the role of social determinants of health.,"The American Heart Association defined cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome as a novel multi-stage disorder. We examined the associations of CKM stages with premature mortality and the role of social determinants of health (SDOHs). A prospective cohort study. A nationally representative sample of US adults from NHANES 1999-2018. CKM included 5 stages (stages 0-4), reflecting progressive pathophysiology. Premature mortality (deaths before 75 years) were ascertained via linkage to the National Death Index with follow-up until 2019. Cox proportional-hazards models adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, medical history, and other confounding factors were used to calculate the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs for CKM-mortality associations. Among 27,909 participants (mean age 49.7 years, 49.0% females), 1762 premature deaths occurred over a median follow-up of 8.3 years. Compared with stage 0, the adjusted HRs for all-cause premature mortality at CKM stages 1-4 were 0.88 (95% CI 0.66-1.17), 1.31 (0.99-1.73), 1.94 (1.31-2.87), and 2.19 (1.61-2.98), respectively. For CVD premature mortality, the adjusted HRs for CKM stages 1-4 were 1.12 (0.46-2.72), 1.74 (0.71-4.28), 3.93 (1.53-10.12), and 6.48 (2.95-14.20), respectively. Among adults at CKM stages 3-4, unfavorable SDOHs, particularly not living with a partner, low family income, lack of private health insurance, unemployment, or ≥2 cumulative SDOHs (4.16, 95% CI 3.35-5.18) were associated with increased all-cause premature mortality. Among those at CKM stages 0-2, unfavorable SDOHs were also related to increased premature mortality. CKM stages 3-4, but not stages 1-2, were associated with increased risks of premature mortality compared with stage 0. The risks were increased by unfavorable SDOHs across CKM stages.",Zhu R; Wang R; He J; Wang L; Chen H; Wang Y; An P; Li K; Ren F; Xu W; Martinez JA; Raben A; Guo J,"The journal of nutrition, health & aging",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39952015/,0,0,0,0,0,1
39856244,Diurnal timing of physical activity in relation to obesity and diabetes in the German National Cohort (NAKO).,"Physical activity supports weight regulation and metabolic health, but its timing in relation to obesity and diabetes remains unclear. We aimed to assess the diurnal timing of physical activity and its association with obesity and diabetes. We cross-sectionally analyzed hip-worn accelerometry data from 61,116 participants aged 20-75 in the German National Cohort between 2015 and 2019. We divided physical activity into sex- and age-standardized quartiles of total morning (06:00-11:59), afternoon (12:00-17:59), evening (18:00-23:59), and nighttime (00:00-06:00) physical activity. Using multivariable logistic regression, we estimated associations of physical activity timing with obesity (BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and diabetes (self-reported or HbA1c ≥ 6.5%). We accounted for sex, age, study region, education, employment, risky alcohol use, smoking, night shift work, and sleep duration. High afternoon (top vs. bottom quartile, OR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.33-0.38) and evening physical activity (OR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.42-0.48) showed lower obesity odds than high morning activity (OR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.66-0.76), whereas nighttime activity increased obesity odds (OR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.48-1.68). Associations were similar for diabetes, with the lowest odds for afternoon (OR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.42-0.53), followed by evening (OR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.50-0.62) and morning activity (OR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.71-0.89), and higher odds for nighttime activity (OR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.29-1.58). Findings were not modified by employment status, night shift work, and sleep duration.

39800617,"Prospective association of changes in (poly)phenol intake, body weight and physical activity with inflammatory profile.","To prospectively evaluate the associations between changes in (poly)phenol intake, body weight(BW), and physical activity(PA) with changes in an inflammatory score after 1-year. This is a prospective observational analysis involving 484 participants from the PREDIMED-Plus with available inflammatory measurements. (Poly)phenol intake was estimated using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire and the Phenol-Explorer database. An inflammatory score was calculated based on 8 blood biomarkers (IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, MCP-1, C-peptide, hs-CRP, leptin, and RANTES). The association between BW, PA, (poly)phenol intake and inflammatory score was evaluated using structural equations. Mediation analyses were performed to assess the relationship between change in (poly)phenol intake and inflammatory score was mediated by the change in BW. A higher increase in total (poly)phenol intake was related to a decrease in the inflammatory score (β = -0.005mg/1000 Kcal; CI95 % = -0.100,0.000) along with a decrease in BW (β = -0.006mg/1000 Kcal; CI95 % = -0.010,-0.003). Increased PA was associated with a lower inflammatory score (β = -0.129MET-min/d; CI95 % = -0.238,-0.021) and BW (β = -0.248MET-min/d; CI95 % = -0.343,-0.152). Finally, a decrease in BW was associated with a decrease in the inflammatory score (β = 0.240 kg; CI95 % = 0.155,0.325). Mediation analyses revealed that changes in BW explained 22 % of the overall association between changes in (poly)phenol intake and inflammatory score.

39767255,Health and Liver Diagnostic Markers Influencing Glycemia in Subjects with Prediabetes: Preview Study.,"Glucose homeostasis may be dependent on liver conditions and influence health-related markers and quality of life (QoL) objective measurements. This study aimed to analyze the interactions of glycemia with liver and health status in a prediabetic population. This study included 2220 overweight/obese prediabetics from the multinational PREVIEW project. Anthropometrics; clinical, metabolic and other health-related markers; and QoL variables were analyzed. Univariate and multilinear-adjusted regression models were run to explain the interrelationships and effect modification between glycemia, health-related QoL (applying SF-12) and metabolic/liver health (using the HSI, a putative marker of fatty liver). Relevant age/sex interactions were found concerning the levels of insulin, HOMA-IR, C peptide and transaminases in this prediabetic population. Multivariate models identified age, sex, glucose, WC and QoL as important predictors of HSI variability (adj. R value = 0.1393, <i>p</i> < 0.001), whereas the QoL status was statistically related to age, sex, HOMA-IR and HSI (adj. R value = 0.1130, <i>p</i> < 0.001) in this glycemia-impaired group. Furthermore, the QoL values declined with increased HSI scores, where a significant interaction was found (<i>p</i> = 0.011) when the data were analyzed when comparing lower glycemia vs. higher glycemia in prediabetics. Indeed, an effect modification was featured depending on the glycemia levels concerning the QoL and HSI worsening. Glycemia associations with the QoL status and liver metabolism markers were evidenced, with clinical implications for diabetes and liver disease precision management given the modification of the QoL outcomes depending on the liver status and glycemia concentrations. Notably, independent associations of circulating glucose with age, sex, adiposity, inflammation and C peptide levels were found.",Ramos-Lopez O; Martinez-Urbistondo D; Navas-Carretero S; Zhu R; Huttunen-Lenz M; Stratton G; Handjieva-Darlenska T; Handjiev S; Sundvall JE; Silvestre MP; Jalo E; Pietiläinen KH; Adam TC; Westerterp-Plantenga M; Simpson E; MacDonald I; Taylor MA; Poppitt SD; Schlicht W; Brand-Miller J; Fogelholm M; Raben A; Martinez JA,"Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39767255/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39505926,GDF15 is required for maintaining subcutaneous adipose tissue lipid metabolic signature.,"Recent research has identified growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) as a crucial factor in various physiological and pathological processes, particularly in energy balance regulation. While the role of GDF15 in modulating energy metabolism through hindbrain GDNF family receptor alpha-like (GFRAL) signaling has been extensively studied, emerging evidence suggests direct peripheral metabolic actions of GDF15. Using knockout mouse models, we investigated GDF15 and GFRAL's roles in adipose tissue metabolism. Our findings indicate that C57BL/6/129/SvJ Gdf15-KO mice exhibit impaired expression of de novo lipogenesis enzymes in subcutaneous adipose tissue (sWAT). In contrast, C57BL/6J Gfral-KO mice showed no impairments compared to wild-type (WT) littermates. RNA-Seq analysis of sWAT in Gdf15-KO mice revealed a broad downregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism. Importantly, our study uncovered sex-specific effects, with females being more affected by GDF15 loss than males. Additionally, we observed a fasting-induced upregulation of GDF15 gene expression in sWAT of both mice and humans, reinforcing this factor's role in adipose tissue lipid metabolism. In conclusion, our research highlights an essential role for GDF15 in sWAT lipid metabolic homeostasis. These insights enhance our understanding of GDF15's functions in adipose tissue physiology and underscore its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic disorders.",Igual-Gil C; Bishop CA; Jähnert M; Johann K; Coleman V; Baum V; Kruse M; Pfeiffer AFH; Pivovarova-Ramich O; Ost M; Kleinert M; Klaus S,Scientific reports,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39505926/,0,0,0,0,0,0
39384179,Effect of a Multifactorial Weight Loss Intervention on HDL Cholesterol Efflux Capacity and Immunosenescence: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Life expectancy and obesity prevalence are increasing worldwide, leading to an increase in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) functionality and immunosenescence play key roles in cardiovascular disease, longevity, and quality of aging. Both molecular hallmarks of aging are impacted by obesity and metabolic syndrome and can be modulated by lifestyle. We aimed to evaluate the effect of a lifestyle intervention focused on an energy-reduced Mediterranean diet (erMedDiet), physical activity (PA), and behavioral support on HDL cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) and immunosenescence. CEC and immunosenescent T cells were determined in 60 participants from the control group (CG) and 56 from the intervention group (IG) of the PREDIMED-Plus trial at baseline and after 1 and 3 years of follow-up. PREDIMED-Plus is a randomized, controlled, parallel-group trial with an IG of erMedDiet, PA promotion, and behavioral support for weight loss and a CG of usual primary care advice. The sample included 116 volunteers from the PREDIMED-Plus-IMDEA subsample of the PREDIMED-Plus trial. Men aged 55 to 75 years and women aged 60 to 75 years with a body mass index between 27 and 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and metabolic syndrome were included. Participants within the IG had significantly improved CEC (2.42% and 10.69% after 1 and 3 years of follow-up) and a decreased in senescent T cell profile (-3.32% ± 12.54% and -6.74% ± 11.2%, <i>p</i> < 0.001, after 1 and 3 years of follow-up).

39064785,Hydrogen-Rich Gas Enhanced Sprint-Interval Performance: Metabolomic Insights into Underlying Mechanisms.,"(1) Background: The diversity of blood biomarkers used to assess the metabolic mechanisms of hydrogen limits a comprehensive understanding of its effects on improving exercise performance. This study evaluated the impact of hydrogen-rich gas (HRG) on metabolites following sprint-interval exercise using metabolomics approaches, aiming to elucidate its underlying mechanisms of action. (2) Methods: Ten healthy adult males participated in the Wingate Sprint-interval test (SIT) following 60 min of HRG or placebo (air) inhalation. Venous blood samples were collected for metabolomic analysis both before and after gas inhalation and subsequent to completing the SIT. (3) Results: Compared with the placebo, HRG inhalation significantly improved mean power, fatigue index, and time to peak for the fourth sprint and significantly reduced the attenuation values of peak power, mean power, and time to peak between the first and fourth. Metabolomic analysis highlighted the significant upregulation of acetylcarnitine, propionyl-L-carnitine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine upon HRG inhalation, with enrichment pathway analysis suggesting that HRG may foster fat mobilization by enhancing coenzyme A synthesis, promoting glycerophospholipid metabolism, and suppressing insulin levels. (4) Conclusions: Inhaling HRG before an SIT enhances end-stage anaerobic sprint capabilities and mitigates fatigue. Metabolomic analysis suggests that HRG may enhance ATP recovery during interval stages by accelerating fat oxidation, providing increased energy replenishment for late-stage sprints.",Dong G; Liu H; Chen Y; Bao D; Xu W; Zhou J,Nutrients,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39064785/,0,0,0,0,1,0

However, the precise interplay between diet and exercise impacting body composition remains unclear, challenging personalized interventions. This study aimed to explore potential interactions and effect modifications of these factors affecting the body mass index (BMI) within an online adult cohort. Data from 11,883 NUTRiMDEA cohort participants were analyzed in this cross-sectional study, categorizing individuals by age, sex, and BMI using linear regression models to assess the interactions between lifestyle factors and adiposity. Significant differences emerged in anthropometry, lifestyle, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) across categories. The combined effect of diet and physical activity had a greater impact on BMI than physical activity or Mediterranean diet adherence alone, with lower BMI as physical activity levels increased (<i>β</i>: -0.5) and adherence to the Mediterranean diet decreased, where a modification effect between them was identified (<i>β</i>: -0.28). Participants with lower Mediterranean diet adherence displayed superior BMI when physical activity was low, but when activity levels were higher, their BMI aligned with those with healthier dietary habits.

38706560,Gut microbes differ in postmenopausal women responding to prunes to maintain hip bone mineral density.,"Foods high in phenolics such as prunes have been shown to exert protective effects on bone mineral density (BMD), but only certain individuals experience these benefits. This <i>post-hoc</i> analysis of a 12-month randomized controlled trial aimed to identify the relationship among the gut microbiome, immune responses, and bone protective effects of prunes on postmenopausal women. Subjects who consumed 50-100 g prunes daily were divided into responders (<i>n</i> = 20) and non-responders (<i>n</i> = 32) based on percent change in total hip bone mineral density (BMD, ≥1% or ≤-1% change, respectively). DXA scans were used to determine body composition and BMD. Immune markers were measured using immunoassays and flow cytometry. Targeted phenolic metabolites were analyzed using ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The fecal microbiota was characterized through 16S rRNA gene PCR amplicon sequencing. After 12 months of prune consumption, anti-inflammatory markers showed responders had significantly lower levels of IL-1β and TNF-α. QIIME2 sequence analysis showed that microbiomes of responders and non-responders differed in alpha (Shannon and Faith PD, Kruskal-Wallis <i>p</i> < 0.05) and beta diversity (unweighted Unifrac, PERMANOVA <i>p</i> < 0.04) metrics both before and after prune treatment. Furthermore, responders had a higher abundance of bacterial families Oscillospiraceae and Lachnospiraceae (ANCOM-BC <i>p</i> < 0.05). These findings provide evidence that postmenopausal women with initial low BMD can benefit from prunes if they host certain gut microbes.

38674256,Nutritional and Lifestyle Features in a Mediterranean Cohort: An Epidemiological Instrument for Categorizing Metabotypes Based on a Computational Algorithm.,"<i>Background and Objectives:</i> Modern classification and categorization of individuals' health requires personalized variables such as nutrition, physical activity, lifestyle, and medical data through advanced analysis and clustering methods involving machine learning tools. The objective of this project was to categorize Mediterranean dwellers' health factors and design metabotypes to provide personalized well-being in order to develop professional implementation tools in addition to characterizing nutritional and lifestyle features in such populations. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> A two-phase observational study was conducted by the Pharmacists Council to identify Spanish nutritional and lifestyle characteristics. Adults over 18 years of age completed questionnaires on general lifestyle habits, dietary patterns (FFQ, MEDAS-17 p), physical activity (IPAQ), quality of life (SF-12), and validated well-being indices (LS7, MEDLIFE, HHS, MHL). Subsequently, exploratory factor, clustering, and random forest analysis methods were conducted to objectively define the metabotypes considering population determinants. <i>Results:</i> A total of 46.4% of the sample (<i>n</i> = 5496) had moderate-to-high adherence to the Mediterranean diet (>8 points), while 71% of the participants declared that they had moderate physical activity. Almost half of the volunteers had a good self-perception of health (49.9%). Regarding lifestyle index, population LS7 showed a fair cardiovascular health status (7.9 ± 1.7), as well as moderate quality of life by MEDLIFE (9.3 ± 2.6) and MHL scores (2.4 ± 0.8). In addition, five metabotype models were developed based on 26 variables: Westernized Millennial (28.6%), healthy (25.1%), active Mediterranean (16.5%), dysmetabolic/pre-morbid (11.5%), and metabolically vulnerable/pro-morbid (18.3%). <i>Conclusions:</i> The support of tools related to precision nutrition and lifestyle integrates well-being characteristics and contributes to reducing the impact of unhealthy lifestyle habits with practical implications for primary care. Combining lifestyle, metabolic, and quality of life traits will facilitate personalized precision interventions and the implementation of targeted public health policies.",García-Perea A; Fernández-Cruz E; de la O-Pascual V; Gonzalez-Zorzano E; Moreno-Aliaga MJ; Tur JA; Martinez JA,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38674256/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38618550,"Effects of a 5-week intake of erythritol and xylitol on vascular function, abdominal fat and glucose tolerance in humans with obesity: a pilot trial.","Previous studies in humans and rats suggest that erythritol might positively affect vascular function, xylitol decrease visceral fat mass and both substances improve glycaemic control. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of a 5-week intake of erythritol and xylitol on vascular function, abdominal fat and blood lipids, glucose tolerance, uric acid, hepatic enzymes, creatinine, gastrointestinal tolerance and dietary patterns in humans with obesity. Forty-two participants were randomised to consume either 36 g erythritol, 24 g xylitol, or no substance daily for 5 weeks. Before and after the intervention, arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity, arteriolar-to-venular diameter ratio), abdominal fat (liver volume, liver fat percentage, visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue, blood lipids), glucose tolerance (glucose and insulin concentrations), uric acid, hepatic enzymes, creatinine, gastrointestinal tolerance and dietary patterns were assessed. Data were analysed by linear mixed effect model. The 5-week intake of erythritol and xylitol showed no statistically significant effect on vascular function. Neither the time nor the treatment effects were significantly different for pulse wave velocity (time effect: p=0.079, Cohen's D (95% CI) -0.14 (-0.54-0.25); treatment effect: p=0.792, Cohen's D (95% CI) control versus xylitol: -0.11 (-0.61-0.35), control versus erythritol: 0.05 (0.44-0.54), erythritol versus xylitol: 0.07 (-0.41-0.54)). There was no statistically significant effect on abdominal fat, glucose tolerance, uric acid, hepatic enzymes and creatinine. Gastrointestinal tolerance was good except for a few diarrhoea-related symptoms. Participants of all groups reduced their consumption of sweetened beverages and sweets compared with preintervention. The 5-week intake of erythritol and xylitol showed no statistically significant effects on vascular function, abdominal fat, or glucose tolerance in people with obesity.

38512828,Combining diaries and accelerometers to explain change in physical activity during a lifestyle intervention for adults with pre-diabetes: A PREVIEW sub-study.,"Self-report and device-based measures of physical activity (PA) both have unique strengths and limitations; combining these measures should provide complementary and comprehensive insights to PA behaviours. Therefore, we aim to 1) identify PA clusters and clusters of change in PA based on self-reported daily activities and 2) assess differences in device-based PA between clusters in a lifestyle intervention, the PREVIEW diabetes prevention study. In total, 232 participants with overweight and prediabetes (147 women; 55.9 ± 9.5yrs; BMI ≥25 kg·m-2; impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance) were clustered using a partitioning around medoids algorithm based on self-reported daily activities before a lifestyle intervention and their changes after 6 and 12 months. Device-assessed PA levels (PAL), sedentary time (SED), light PA (LPA), and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) were assessed using ActiSleep+ accelerometers and compared between clusters using (multivariate) analyses of covariance. At baseline, the self-reported ""walking and housework"" cluster had significantly higher PAL, MVPA and LPA, and less SED than the ""inactive"" cluster. LPA was higher only among the ""cycling"" cluster. There was no difference in the device-based measures between the ""social-sports"" and ""inactive"" clusters. Looking at the changes after 6 months, the ""increased walking"" cluster showed the greatest increase in PAL while the ""increased cycling"" cluster accumulated the highest amount of LPA. The ""increased housework"" and ""increased supervised sports"" reported least favourable changes in device-based PA. After 12 months, there was only minor change in activities between the ""increased walking and cycling"", ""no change"" and ""increased supervised sports"" clusters, with no significant differences in device-based measures. Combining self-report and device-based measures provides better insights into the behaviours that change during an intervention.

38416096,Role of Eating Behavior and Stress in Maintenance of Dietary Changes During the PREVIEW Intervention.,"To examine whether eating behavior and perceived stress predict the maintenance of self-reported dietary change and adherence to dietary instructions during an intervention. A secondary analysis of the behavior maintenance stage (6-36 months) of the 3-year PREVIEW intervention (PREVention of diabetes through lifestyle Intervention and population studies in Europe and around the World). Adults (n = 1,311) with overweight and prediabetes at preintervention baseline. Eating behavior (Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire), stress (Perceived Stress Scale), and dietary intake (4-day food records on 4 occasions) were reported. Associations between predictors and dietary outcomes were examined with linear mixed-effects models for repeated measurements. Eating behaviors and stress at 6 months did not predict the subsequent change in dietary outcomes, but higher cognitive restraint predicted lower energy intake, and both higher disinhibition and hunger predicted higher energy intake during the following behavior maintenance stage. In addition, higher disinhibition predicted higher saturated fat intake and lower fiber intake, and higher hunger predicted lower fiber intake. Stress was not associated with energy intake or dietary quality. Eating behaviors and stress were not consistently associated with adherence to dietary instructions. Higher cognitive restraint predicted lower energy intake (food quantity), but disinhibition and hunger were also associated with dietary quality.",Jalo E; Fogelholm M; Westerterp-Plantenga M; Adam TC; Drummen M; Huttunen-Lenz M; Kjølbæk L; Martinez JA; Handjieva-Darlenska T; Taylor MA; Brand-Miller J; Poppitt S; Stratton G; Lam T; Navas-Carretero S; Bogdanov G; Simpson L; Muirhead R; Silvestre MP; Swindell N; Raben A; Konttinen H,Journal of nutrition education and behavior,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38416096/,0,0,0,0,0,0
38019262,Resistance exercise protects mice from protein-induced fat accretion.,"Low-protein (LP) diets extend the lifespan of diverse species and are associated with improved metabolic health in both rodents and humans. Paradoxically, many athletes and bodybuilders consume high-protein (HP) diets and protein supplements, yet are both fit and metabolically healthy. Here, we examine this paradox using weight pulling, a validated progressive resistance exercise training regimen, in mice fed either an LP diet or an isocaloric HP diet. We find that despite having lower food consumption than the LP group, HP-fed mice gain significantly more fat mass than LP-fed mice when not exercising, while weight pulling protected HP-fed mice from this excess fat accretion. The HP diet augmented exercise-induced hypertrophy of the forearm flexor complex, and weight pulling ability increased more rapidly in the exercised HP-fed mice. Surprisingly, exercise did not protect from HP-induced changes in glycemic control. Our results confirm that HP diets can augment muscle hypertrophy and accelerate strength gain induced by resistance exercise without negative effects on fat mass, and also demonstrate that LP diets may be advantageous in the sedentary. Our results highlight the need to consider both dietary composition and activity, not simply calories, when taking a precision nutrition approach to health.",Trautman ME; Braucher LN; Elliehausen C; Zhu WG; Zelenovskiy E; Green M; Sonsalla MM; Yeh CY; Hornberger TA; Konopka AR; Lamming DW,eLife,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38019262/,0,0,0,0,0,0
37851444,"An Energy-Reduced Mediterranean Diet, Physical Activity, and Body Composition: An Interim Subgroup Analysis of the PREDIMED-Plus Randomized Clinical Trial.","Strategies targeting body composition may help prevent chronic diseases in persons with excess weight, but randomized clinical trials evaluating lifestyle interventions have rarely reported effects on directly quantified body composition. To evaluate the effects of a lifestyle weight-loss intervention on changes in overall and regional body composition. The ongoing Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea-Plus (PREDIMED-Plus) randomized clinical trial is designed to test the effect of the intervention on cardiovascular disease prevention after 8 years of follow-up. The trial is being conducted in 23 Spanish research centers and includes men and women (age 55-75 years) with body mass index between 27 and 40 and metabolic syndrome. The trial reported herein is an interim subgroup analysis of the intermediate outcome body composition after 3-year follow-up, and data analysis was conducted from February 1 to November 30, 2022. Of 6874 total PREDIMED-Plus participants, a subsample of 1521 individuals, coming from centers with access to a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry device, underwent body composition measurements at 3 time points. Participants were randomly allocated to a multifactorial intervention based on an energy-reduced Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) and increased physical activity (PA) or to a control group based on usual care, with advice to follow an ad libitum MedDiet, but no physical activity promotion. The outcomes (continuous) were 3-year changes in total fat and lean mass (expressed as percentages of body mass) and visceral fat (in grams), tested using multivariable linear mixed-effects models. Clinical relevance of changes in body components (dichotomous) was assessed based on 5% or more improvements in baseline values, using logistic regression. Main analyses were performed in the evaluable population (completers only) and in sensitivity analyses, multiple imputation was performed to include data of participants lost to follow-up (intention-to-treat analyses). A total of 1521 individuals were included (mean [SD] age, 65.3 [5.0] years; 52.1% men). In comparison with the control group (n=761), participants in the intervention arm (n=760) showed greater reductions in the percentage of total fat (between group differences after 1-year, -0.94% [95% CI, -1.19 to -0.69]; 3 years, -0.38% [95% CI, -0.64 to -0.12] and visceral fat storage after 1 year, -126 g [95% CI, -179 to -73.3 g]; 3 years, -70.4 g [95% CI, -126 to -15.2 g] and greater increases in the percentage of total lean mass at 1 year, 0.88% [95% CI, 0.63%-1.12%]; 3-years 0.34% [95% CI, 0.09%-0.60%]). The intervention group was more likely to show improvements of 5% or more in baseline body components (absolute risk reduction after 1 year, 13% for total fat mass, 11% for total lean mass, and 14% for visceral fat mass; after 3-years: 6% for total fat mass, 6% for total lean mass, and 8% for visceral fat mass). The number of participants needed to treat was between 12 and 17 to attain at least 1 individual with possibly clinically meaningful improvements in body composition. The findings of this trial suggest a weight-loss lifestyle intervention based on an energy-reduced MedDiet and physical activity significantly reduced total and visceral fat and attenuated age-related losses of lean mass in older adults with overweight or obesity and metabolic syndrome. Continued follow-up is warranted to confirm the long-term consequences of these changes on cardiovascular clinical end points. isrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN89898870.",Konieczna J; Ruiz-Canela M; Galmes-Panades AM; Abete I; Babio N; Fiol M; Martín-Sánchez V; Estruch R; Vidal J; Buil-Cosiales P; García-Gavilán JF; Moñino M; Marcos-Delgado A; Casas R; Olbeyra R; Fitó M; Hu FB; Martínez-Gonzalez MÁ; Martínez JA; Romaguera D; Salas-Salvadó J,JAMA network open,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37851444/,0,0,0,0,1,1

To evaluate the association between changes in PA and changes in cognitive function in a cohort of adults with metabolic syndrome. Longitudinal observational study including 5,500 adults (mean age 65 years, SD = 5; women = 49.3% ) with metabolic syndrome. Participants underwent physical activity measurements and cognitive evaluation at baseline and at two-years of follow-up. PA was quantified using the Minnesota questionnaire-shortened version. Cognitive function was evaluated using a battery of tests: Mini-Mental Test Examination, Clock Drawing Test, Trail Making Test A and B, Verbal Fluency Test, and Digit Span. The primary outcome was two-year change in cognition, measured through the Global Composite Score (GCS) of all neuropsychological tests. Multivariable-adjusted linear regression models were fitted with baseline PA and their changes as the main exposures and changes in cognitive function as the outcome. No significant association was found between PA levels (or their changes) in the GCS of cognitive function. A greater increase in PA levels was associated with a more favorable two-year change in the Trail Making Test A (Q4 versus Q1: b = - 2.24s, 95% CI -4.36 to -0.12s; p-trend = 0.020). No significant association was found for other neuropsychological test.

37599689,Predicting weight loss success on a new Nordic diet: an untargeted multi-platform metabolomics and machine learning approach.,"Results from randomized controlled trials indicate that no single diet performs better than other for all people living with obesity. Regardless of the diet plan, there is always large inter-individual variability in weight changes, with some individuals losing weight and some not losing or even gaining weight. This raises the possibility that, for different individuals, the optimal diet for successful weight loss may differ. The current study utilized machine learning to build a predictive model for successful weight loss in subjects with overweight or obesity on a New Nordic Diet (NND). Ninety-one subjects consumed an NND <i>ad libitum</i> for 26 weeks. Based on their weight loss, individuals were classified as responders (weight loss ≥5%, <i>n</i> = 46) or non-responders (weight loss <2%, <i>n</i> = 24). We used clinical baseline data combined with baseline urine and plasma untargeted metabolomics data from two different analytical platforms, resulting in a data set including 2,766 features, and employed symbolic regression (QLattice) to develop a predictive model for weight loss success. There were no differences in clinical parameters at baseline between responders and non-responders, except age (47 ± 13 vs. 39 ± 11 years, respectively, <i>p</i> = 0.009). The final predictive model for weight loss contained adipic acid and argininic acid from urine (both metabolites were found at lower levels in responders) and generalized from the training (AUC 0.88) to the test set (AUC 0.81). Responders were also able to maintain a weight loss of 4.3% in a 12 month follow-up period. We identified a model containing two metabolites that were able to predict the likelihood of achieving a clinically significant weight loss on an <i>ad libitum</i> NND. This work demonstrates that models based on an untargeted multi-platform metabolomics approach can be used to optimize precision dietary treatment for obesity.",Pigsborg K; Stentoft-Larsen V; Demharter S; Aldubayan MA; Trimigno A; Khakimov B; Engelsen SB; Astrup A; Hjorth MF; Dragsted LO; Magkos F,Frontiers in nutrition,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37599689/,0,0,0,0,0,1

We aimed to compare changes in body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors and type 2 diabetes incidence during a lifestyle intervention between individuals with MHO vs MUO. This post-hoc analysis included 1012 participants with MHO and 1153 participants with MUO at baseline in the randomized trial PREVIEW. Participants underwent an eight-week low-energy diet phase followed by a 148-week lifestyle-based weight-maintenance intervention. Adjusted linear mixed models and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used. There were no statistically significant differences in weight loss (%) between participants with MHO vs MUO over 156 weeks. At the end of the study, weight loss was 2.7% (95% CI, 1.7%-3.6%) in participants with MHO and 3.0% (2.1%-4.0%) in those with MUO. After the low-energy diet phase, participants with MHO had smaller decreases in triglyceride (mean difference between MHO vs MUO 0.08 mmol·L<sup>-1</sup> [95% CI, 0.04-0.12]; P < 0.001) but similar reductions in fasting glucose and HOMA-IR than those with MUO.

A range in bioavailability was observed in individual polyphenolic compounds across genotypes. Both alpha and beta diversity analyses indicated that gut microbiome profiles varied with blueberry dose in rats.

37181156,Supplementation with inulin-type fructans affects gut microbiota and attenuates some of the cardiometabolic benefits of a plant-based diet in individuals with overweight or obesity.,"The gut microbiota has emerged as a potential therapeutic target to improve the management of obesity and its comorbidities. We investigated the impact of a high fiber (∼38 g/d) plant-based diet, consumed <i>ad libitum</i>, with or without added inulin-type fructans (ITF), on the gut microbiota composition and cardiometabolic outcomes in subjects with obesity. We also tested if baseline <i>Prevotella/Bacteroides</i> (P/B) ratio predicts weight loss outcomes. This is a secondary exploratory analysis from the PREVENTOMICS study, in which 100 subjects (82 completers) aged 18-65 years with body mass index 27-40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were randomized to 10 weeks of double-blinded treatment with a personalized or a generic plant-based diet. Changes from baseline to end-of-trial in gut microbiota composition (16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing), body composition, cardiometabolic health and inflammatory markers were evaluated in the whole cohort (<i>n</i> = 82), and also compared in the subgroup of subjects who were supplemented with an additional 20 g/d ITF-prebiotics (<i>n</i> = 21) or their controls (<i>n</i> = 22). In response to the plant-based diet, all subjects lost weight (-3.2 [95% CI -3.9, -2.5] kg) and experienced significant improvements in body composition and cardiometabolic health indices. Addition of ITF to the plant-based diet reduced microbial diversity (Shannon index) and selectively increased <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and <i>Faecalibacterium</i> (<i>q</i> < 0.05). The change in the latter was significantly associated with higher values of insulin and HOMA-IR and lower HDL cholesterol. In addition, the LDL:HDL ratio and the concentrations of IL-10, MCP-1 and TNFα were significantly elevated in the ITF-subgroup. There was no relationship between baseline P/B ratio and changes in body weight (<i>r</i> = -0.07, <i>p</i> = 0.53). A plant-based diet consumed <i>ad libitum</i> modestly decreases body weight and has multiple health benefits in individuals with obesity.

37105011,Translation of nutrigenomic research for personalised and precision nutrition for cancer prevention and for cancer survivors.,"Personalised and precision nutrition uses information on individual characteristics and responses to nutrients, foods and dietary patterns to develop targeted nutritional advice that is more effective in improving the diet and health of each individual. Moving away from the conventional 'one size fits all', such targeted intervention approaches may pave the way to better population health, including lower burden of non-communicable diseases. To date, most personalised and precision nutrition approaches have been focussed on tackling obesity and cardiometabolic diseases with limited efforts directed to cancer prevention and for cancer survivors. Advances in understanding the biological basis of cancer and of the role played by diet in cancer prevention and in survival after cancer diagnosis, mean that it is timely to test and to apply such personalised and precision nutrition approaches in the cancer area. This endeavour can take advantage of the enhanced understanding of interactions between dietary factors, individual genotype and the gut microbiome that impact on risk of, and survival after, cancer diagnosis. Translation of these basic research into public health action should include real-time acquisition of nutrigenomic and related data and use of AI-based data integration methods in systems approaches that can be scaled up using mobile devices.",Malcomson FC; Mathers JC,Redox biology,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37105011/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Immune system has the basic functions of immune defense, immune self stabilization and immune surveillance. Balanced nutrition is the cornerstone of the immune system to play its immune function, and nutritional intervention is also an important means to maintain and improve immunity. Previous studies have confirmed that T cells have individual differences in recognizing viral antigens of virus infected cells, and the body's response to antigens is controlled by a variety of genetic genes, such as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, immune response (Ir) genes, etc. In this paper, through immunity genetic testing, we screen out genetically susceptible people with low immunity and people with the risk of nutrient metabolism disorders; through using lifestyle questionnaire and physical examination results, we analyze people's physical condition, dietary habits, and exercise habits to evaluate people's nutrient deficiency degree. Then, combining multi-dimensional health data, we evaluate users' immune status and nutritional deficiency risk comprehensively, further, we implemented personalized nutrition intervention on the types and doses of nutritional supplements to improve immunity.

PhenoDiet group B showed no significant improvements in the primary outcome disposition index, but greater improvements in insulin sensitivity, glucose homeostasis, serum triacylglycerol, and C-reactive protein compared with PhenoDiet group A were observed. We demonstrate that modulating macronutrient composition within the dietary guidelines based on tissue-specific insulin resistance (IR) phenotype enhances cardiometabolic health improvements.

36405402,Policy implementation and priorities to create healthy food environments using the Healthy Food Environment Policy Index (Food-EPI): A pooled level analysis across eleven European countries.,"Food environments have been recognised as highly influential on population diets. Government policies have great potential to create healthy food environments to promote healthy diets. This study aimed to evaluate food environment policy implementation in European countries and identify priority actions for governments to create healthy food environments. The Healthy Food Environment Policy Index (Food-EPI) was used to evaluate the level of food environment policy and infrastructure support implementation in Estonia, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, and Spain in 2019-2021. Evidence of implementation of food environment policies was compiled in each country and validated by government officials. National experts evaluated the implementation of policies and identified priority recommendations. Finland had the highest proportion (32%, <i>n</i> = 7/22) of policies shaping food environments with a ""high"" level of implementation. Slovenia and Poland had the highest proportion of policies rated at very low implementation (42%, <i>n</i> = 10/24 and 36%, <i>n</i> = 9/25 respectively). Policies regarding food provision, promotion, retail, funding, monitoring, and health in all policies were identified as the most important gaps across the European countries. Experts recommended immediate action on setting standards for nutrients of concern in processed foods, improvement of school food environments, fruit and vegetable subsidies, unhealthy food and beverage taxation, and restrictions on unhealthy food marketing to children. Immediate implementation of policies and infrastructure support that prioritize action towards healthy food environments is urgently required to tackle the burden of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases in Europe.

36335092,Perceived stress as a predictor of eating behavior during the 3-year PREVIEW lifestyle intervention.,"To better support participants to achieve long-lasting results within interventions aiming for weight loss and maintenance, more information is needed about the maintenance of behavioral changes. Therefore, we examined whether perceived stress predicts the maintenance of changes in eating behavior (flexible and rigid restraint of eating, disinhibition, and hunger). The present study was a secondary analysis of the PREVIEW intervention including participants with overweight (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) at baseline and high risk of type 2 diabetes (n = 1311). Intervention included a 2-month low-energy diet phase and a 34-month subsequent weight maintenance phase. The first 6 months were considered an active behavior change stage and the remaining 2.5 years were considered a behavior maintenance stage. Eating behavior was measured using the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire and stress using the Perceived Stress Scale. The associations between stress and eating behavior were analyzed using linear mixed effects models for repeated measurements. Perceived stress measured after the active behavior change stage (at 6 months) did not predict changes in eating behavior during the behavior maintenance stage. However, frequent high stress during this period was associated with greater lapse of improved flexible restraint (p = 0.026). The mean (SD) change in flexible restraint from 6 to 36 months was -1.1 (2.1) in participants with frequent stress and -0.7 (1.8) in participants without frequent stress (Cohen's d<sub>s</sub> (95% CI) = 0.24 (0.04-0.43)). Higher perceived stress at 6 months was associated with less flexible restraint and more disinhibition and hunger throughout the behavior maintenance stage (all p < 0.001). Perceived stress was associated with features of eating behavior that may impair successful weight loss maintenance. Future interventions should investigate, whether incorporating stress reduction techniques results in more effective treatment, particularly for participants experiencing a high stress level.",Jalo E; Konttinen H; Westerterp-Plantenga M; Adam T; Drummen M; Huttunen-Lenz M; Siig Vestentoft P; Martinez JA; Handjiev S; Macdonald I; Brand-Miller J; Poppitt S; Swindell N; Lam T; Navas-Carretero S; Handjieva-Darlenska T; Taylor M; Muirhead R; Silvestre MP; Raben A; Fogelholm M,Nutrition & diabetes,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36335092/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36294858,Should Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) Be Considered an Umbrella Disorder for Mental Illness and Associated Genetic and Epigenetic Induced Dysregulation of Brain Reward Circuitry?,"Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) is defined as a breakdown of reward neurotransmission that results in a wide range of addictive, compulsive, and impulsive behaviors. RDS is caused by a combination of environmental (epigenetic) influences and DNA-based (genetic) neurotransmission deficits that interfere with the normal satisfaction of human physiological drives (i.e., food, water, and sex). An essential feature of RDS is the lack of integration between perception, cognition, and emotions that occurs because of (1) significant dopaminergic surges in motivation, reward, and learning centers causing neuroplasticity in the striato-thalamic-frontal cortical loop; (2) hypo-functionality of the excitatory glutamatergic afferents from the amygdala-hippocampus complex. A large volume of literature regarding the known neurogenetic and psychological underpinnings of RDS has revealed a significant risk of dopaminergic gene polymorphic allele overlap between cohorts of depression and subsets of schizophrenia. The suggestion is that instead of alcohol, opioids, gambling disorders, etc. being endophenotypes, the true phenotype is RDS. Additionally, reward deficiency can result from depleted or hereditary hypodopaminergia, which can manifest as a variety of personality traits and mental/medical disorders that have been linked to genetic studies with dopamine-depleting alleles. The carrying of known DNA antecedents, including epigenetic insults, results in a life-long vulnerability to RDS conditions and addictive behaviors. Epigenetic repair of hypodopaminergia, the causative basis of addictive behaviors, may involve precision DNA-guided therapy achieved by combining the Genetic Addiction Risk Severity (GARS) test with a researched neutraceutical having a number of variant names, including KB220Z. This nutraceutical formulation with pro-dopamine regulatory capabilities has been studied and published in peer-reviewed journals, mostly from our laboratory. Finally, it is our opinion that RDS should be given an ICD code and deserves to be included in the DSM-VI because while the DSM features symptomology, it is equally important to feature etiological roots as portrayed in the RDS model.",Blum K; Dennen CA; Elman I; Bowirrat A; Thanos PK; Badgaiyan RD; Downs BW; Bagchi D; Baron D; Braverman ER; Gupta A; Green R; McLaughlin T; Barh D; Gold MS,Journal of personalized medicine,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36294858/,0,0,0,0,0,0
36261843,Dietary protein and the glycemic index handle insulin resistance within a nutritional program for avoiding weight regain after energy-restricted induced weight loss.,"The role of dietary protein and glycemic index on insulin resistance (based on TyG index) within a nutritional program for weight loss and weight maintenance was examined. This study analyzed 744 adults with overweight/obesity within the DIOGenes project. Patients who lost at least 8% of their initial weight (0-8 weeks) after a low-calorie diet (LCD) were randomly assigned to one of five ad libitum diets designed for weight maintenance (8-34 weeks): high/low protein (HP/LP) and high/low glycemic index (HGI/LGI), plus a control. The complete nutritional program (0-34 weeks) included both LCD plus the randomized diets intervention. The TyG index was tested as marker of body mass composition and insulin resistance. In comparison with the LP/HGI diet, the HP/LGI diet induced a greater BMI loss (p < 0.05). ∆TyG was positively associated with resistance to BMI loss (β = 0.343, p = 0.042) during the weight maintenance stage. In patients who followed the HP/LGI diet, TyG (after LCD) correlated with greater BMI loss in the 8-34 weeks period (r = -0.256; p < 0.05) and during the 0-34 weeks intervention (r = -0.222, p < 0.05) periods. ΔTyG<sub>1</sub> value was associated with ΔBMI<sub>2</sub> (β = 0.932; p = 0.045) concerning the HP/LGI diet. A HP/LGI diet is beneficial not only for weight maintenance after a LCD, but is also related to IR amelioration as assessed by TyG index changes.

36055772,Research gaps and opportunities in precision nutrition: an NIH workshop report.,"Precision nutrition is an emerging concept that aims to develop nutrition recommendations tailored to different people's circumstances and biological characteristics. Responses to dietary change and the resulting health outcomes from consuming different diets may vary significantly between people based on interactions between their genetic backgrounds, physiology, microbiome, underlying health status, behaviors, social influences, and environmental exposures. On 11-12 January 2021, the National Institutes of Health convened a workshop entitled ""Precision Nutrition: Research Gaps and Opportunities"" to bring together experts to discuss the issues involved in better understanding and addressing precision nutrition. The workshop proceeded in 3 parts: part I covered many aspects of genetics and physiology that mediate the links between nutrient intake and health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer disease, and cancer; part II reviewed potential contributors to interindividual variability in dietary exposures and responses such as baseline nutritional status, circadian rhythm/sleep, environmental exposures, sensory properties of food, stress, inflammation, and the social determinants of health; part III presented the need for systems approaches, with new methods and technologies that can facilitate the study and implementation of precision nutrition, and workforce development needed to create a new generation of researchers. The workshop concluded that much research will be needed before more precise nutrition recommendations can be achieved. This includes better understanding and accounting for variables such as age, sex, ethnicity, medical history, genetics, and social and environmental factors. The advent of new methods and technologies and the availability of considerably more data bring tremendous opportunity. However, the field must proceed with appropriate levels of caution and make sure the factors listed above are all considered, and systems approaches and methods are incorporated. It will be important to develop and train an expanded workforce with the goal of reducing health disparities and improving precision nutritional advice for all Americans.",Lee BY; Ordovás JM; Parks EJ; Anderson CAM; Barabási AL; Clinton SK; de la Haye K; Duffy VB; Franks PW; Ginexi EM; Hammond KJ; Hanlon EC; Hittle M; Ho E; Horn AL; Isaacson RS; Mabry PL; Malone S; Martin CK; Mattei J; Meydani SN; Nelson LM; Neuhouser ML; Parent B; Pronk NP; Roche HM; Saria S; Scheer FAJL; Segal E; Sevick MA; Spector TD; Van Horn L; Varady KA; Voruganti VS; Martinez MF,The American journal of clinical nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36055772/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35970928,A wearable electrochemical biosensor for the monitoring of metabolites and nutrients.,"Wearable non-invasive biosensors for the continuous monitoring of metabolites in sweat can detect a few analytes at sufficiently high concentrations, typically during vigorous exercise so as to generate sufficient quantity of the biofluid. Here we report the design and performance of a wearable electrochemical biosensor for the continuous analysis, in sweat during physical exercise and at rest, of trace levels of multiple metabolites and nutrients, including all essential amino acids and vitamins. The biosensor consists of graphene electrodes that can be repeatedly regenerated in situ, functionalized with metabolite-specific antibody-like molecularly imprinted polymers and redox-active reporter nanoparticles, and integrated with modules for iontophoresis-based sweat induction, microfluidic sweat sampling, signal processing and calibration, and wireless communication. In volunteers, the biosensor enabled the real-time monitoring of the intake of amino acids and their levels during physical exercise, as well as the assessment of the risk of metabolic syndrome (by correlating amino acid levels in serum and sweat).

35839545,"A double-blinded, randomized, parallel intervention to evaluate biomarker-based nutrition plans for weight loss: The PREVENTOMICS study.","Growing evidence suggests that biomarker-guided dietary interventions can optimize response to treatment. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of the PREVENTOMCIS platform-which uses metabolomic and genetic information to classify individuals into different 'metabolic clusters' and create personalized dietary plans-for improving health outcomes in subjects with overweight or obesity. A 10-week parallel, double-blinded, randomized intervention was conducted in 100 adults (82 completers) aged 18-65 years, with body mass index ≥27 but <40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, who were allocated into either a personalized diet group (n = 49) or a control diet group (n = 51). About 60% of all food was provided free-of-charge. No specific instruction to restrict energy intake was given. The primary outcome was change in fat mass from baseline, evaluated by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Other endpoints included body weight, waist circumference, lipid profile, glucose homeostasis markers, inflammatory markers, blood pressure, physical activity, stress and eating behavior. There were significant main effects of time (P < 0.01), but no group main effects, or time-by-group interactions, for the change in fat mass (personalized: -2.1 [95% CI -2.9, -1.4] kg; control: -2.0 [95% CI -2.7, -1.3] kg) and body weight (personalized: -3.1 [95% CI -4.1, -2.1] kg; control: -3.3 [95% CI -4.2, -2.4] kg). The difference between groups in fat mass change was -0.1 kg (95% CI -1.2, 0.9 kg, P = 0.77). Both diets resulted in significant improvements in insulin resistance and lipid profile, but there were no significant differences between groups. Personalized dietary plans did not result in greater benefits over a generic, but generally healthy diet, in this 10-week clinical trial. Further studies are required to establish the soundness of different precision nutrition approaches, and translate this science into clinically relevant dietary advice to reduce the burden of obesity and its comorbidities.

35776947,"Perspective: Leveraging the Gut Microbiota to Predict Personalized Responses to Dietary, Prebiotic, and Probiotic Interventions.","Humans often show variable responses to dietary, prebiotic, and probiotic interventions. Emerging evidence indicates that the gut microbiota is a key determinant for this population heterogeneity. Here, we provide an overview of some of the major computational and experimental tools being applied to critical questions of microbiota-mediated personalized nutrition and health. First, we discuss the latest advances in in silico modeling of the microbiota-nutrition-health axis, including the application of statistical, mechanistic, and hybrid artificial intelligence models. Second, we address high-throughput in vitro techniques for assessing interindividual heterogeneity, from ex vivo batch culturing of stool and continuous culturing in anaerobic bioreactors, to more sophisticated organ-on-a-chip models that integrate both host and microbial compartments. Third, we explore in vivo approaches for better understanding of personalized, microbiota-mediated responses to diet, prebiotics, and probiotics, from nonhuman animal models and human observational studies, to human feeding trials and crossover interventions. We highlight examples of existing, consumer-facing precision nutrition platforms that are currently leveraging the gut microbiota. Furthermore, we discuss how the integration of a broader set of the tools and techniques described in this piece can generate the data necessary to support a greater diversity of precision nutrition strategies.

35745100,Impact of Physical Activity Differences Due to COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown on Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Parameters in Adults with Metabolic Syndrome.,"A Mediterranean lifestyle with a Mediterranean diet and regular physical activity (PA) improves metabolic syndrome (MetS) characteristics and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The COVID-19 pandemic stopped healthy habits and increased NAFLD progression. To assess how PA differences due to COVID-19 lockdown affected NAFLD parameters in adults with MetS. Longitudinal 2-year analysis of data obtained between COVID-19 pre- and post-lockdown in a parallel-group randomized trial (n = 57, aged 40-60 years old, with MetS and NAFLD). NAFLD status and related parameters were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), blood collection analysis and related indexes. PA and fitness status were assessed by an Alpha-Fit test battery, accelerometers, validated Minnesota questionnaire and functional fitness score. During lockdown, study personnel telephoned patients to motivate them. Participants were grouped according to PA levels. The low PA group improved its fitness score tests (0.2) after lockdown more than the medium PA group, and it decreased its sedentary activity (-48.7 min/day), increased light (20.9 min/day) and moderate (32.3 min/day) PA intensities and improved sleep efficiency (0.6%) in comparison with the medium and high PA groups. The high PA group increased its steps per day more than the other groups. The low PA group was the only group that decreased its gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels (-17.0 U/L). All groups increased their fatty liver index (FLI) after lockdown, but the medium PA group increased its FLI more than the low PA group. Participants in the high PA group decreased their HDL-cholesterol levels more than participants in the medium PA group (-0.4 mg/dL). Stopping regular PA together with an unhealthy lifestyle leads to a worsening of MetS and NAFLD. COVID-19 lockdown induced a decrease in PA in more active people, but inactive people increased their PA levels.

A Post Hoc Analysis of the PREVIEW Study.,"To examine whether the effect of a 3-year lifestyle intervention on body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors differs by prediabetes metabolic phenotype. This post hoc analysis of the multicenter, randomized trial, PREVention of diabetes through lifestyle interventions and population studies In Europe and around the World (PREVIEW), included 1,510 participants with prediabetes (BMI ≥25 kg ⋅ m-2; defined using oral glucose tolerance tests). Of these, 58% had isolated impaired fasting glucose (iIFG), 6% had isolated impaired glucose tolerance (iIGT), and 36% had IFG+IGT; 73% had normal hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c; <39 mmol ⋅ mol-1) and 25% had intermediate HbA1c (39-47 mmol ⋅ mol-1). Participants underwent an 8-week diet-induced rapid weight loss, followed by a 148-week lifestyle-based weight maintenance intervention. Linear mixed models adjusted for intervention arm and other confounders were used. In the available-case and complete-case analyses, participants with IFG+IGT had greater sustained weight loss after lifestyle intervention (adjusted mean at 156 weeks -3.5% [95% CI, -4.7%, -2.3%]) than those with iIFG (mean -2.5% [-3.6%, -1.3%]) relative to baseline (P = 0.011). Participants with IFG+IGT and iIFG had similar cardiometabolic benefits from the lifestyle intervention. The differences in cardiometabolic benefits between those with iIGT and IFG+IGT were minor or inconsistent in different analyses. Participants with normal versus intermediate HbA1c had similar weight loss over 3 years and minor differences in cardiometabolic benefits during weight loss, whereas those with normal HbA1c had greater improvements in fasting glucose, 2-h glucose (adjusted between-group difference at 156 weeks -0.54 mmol ⋅ L-1 [95% CI -0.70, -0.39], P < 0.001), and triglycerides (difference -0.07 mmol ⋅ L-1 [-0.11, -0.03], P < 0.001) during the lifestyle intervention.

35610522,Age- and sex-specific effects of a long-term lifestyle intervention on body weight and cardiometabolic health markers in adults with prediabetes: results from the diabetes prevention study PREVIEW.,"Lifestyle interventions are the first-line treatment option for body weight and cardiometabolic health management. However, whether age groups or women and men respond differently to lifestyle interventions is under debate. We aimed to examine age- and sex-specific effects of a low-energy diet (LED) followed by a long-term lifestyle intervention on body weight, body composition and cardiometabolic health markers in adults with prediabetes (i.e. impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance). This observational study used longitudinal data from 2223 overweight participants with prediabetes in the multicentre diabetes prevention study PREVIEW. The participants underwent a LED-induced rapid weight loss (WL) period followed by a 3 year lifestyle-based weight maintenance (WM) intervention. Changes in outcomes of interest in prespecified age (younger: 25-45 years; middle-aged: 46-54 years; older: 55-70 years) or sex (women and men) groups were compared. In total, 783 younger, 319 middle-aged and 1121 older adults and 1503 women and 720 men were included in the analysis. In the available case and complete case analyses, multivariable-adjusted linear mixed models showed that younger and older adults had similar weight loss after the LED, whereas older adults had greater sustained weight loss after the WM intervention (adjusted difference for older vs younger adults -1.25% [95% CI -1.92, -0.58], p<0.001). After the WM intervention, older adults lost more fat-free mass and bone mass and had smaller improvements in 2 h plasma glucose (adjusted difference for older vs younger adults 0.65 mmol/l [95% CI 0.50, 0.80], p<0.001) and systolic blood pressure (adjusted difference for older vs younger adults 2.57 mmHg [95% CI 1.37, 3.77], p<0.001) than younger adults. Older adults had smaller decreases in fasting and 2 h glucose, HbA<sub>1c</sub> and systolic blood pressure after the WM intervention than middle-aged adults. In the complete case analysis, the above-mentioned differences between middle-aged and older adults disappeared, but the direction of the effect size did not change. After the WL period, compared with men, women had less weight loss (adjusted difference for women vs men 1.78% [95% CI 1.12, 2.43], p<0.001) with greater fat-free mass and bone mass loss and smaller improvements in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, LDL-cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure. After the WM intervention, women had greater fat-free mass and bone mass loss and smaller improvements in HbA<sub>1c</sub> and LDL-cholesterol, while they had greater improvements in fasting glucose, triacylglycerol (adjusted difference for women vs men -0.08 mmol/l [-0.11, -0.04], p<0.001) and HDL-cholesterol. Older adults benefited less from a lifestyle intervention in relation to body composition and cardiometabolic health markers than younger adults, despite greater sustained weight loss. Women benefited less from a LED followed by a lifestyle intervention in relation to body weight and body composition than men. Future interventions targeting older adults or women should take prevention of fat-free mass and bone mass loss into consideration.

35602745,Reliability and Validation of the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire in 3- to 6-Year-Old Spanish Children.,"Eating behavior is often established during the first years of life. Therefore, it is important to make a research on it to understand the relationships that children have with food and how this can contribute to prevent the development of childhood obesity. An appropriate assessment of eating behavior can be achieved using the ""Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire"" (CEBQ). This questionnaire has been validated in several populations and languages, but it has never been translated, adapted, and validated for Spanish children. To evaluate the reliability and internal consistency of the CEBQ questionnaire, culturally adapted and translated into Spanish (Spain), in Spanish families with children aged 3 to 6 years, as well as its association with children's body mass index (BMI) to test its construct validity. Children between 3 and 6 years old were recruited from the ongoing MELI-POP randomized controlled clinical trial, as well as from public schools located in middle class neighborhoods of Zaragoza, Spain, to complete the sample. Sociodemographic characteristics and anthropometric measures were obtained according to standardized methods. The 35-item CEBQ questionnaire was completed twice with a time difference of 3 weeks between each response. Statistical analyses included the evaluation of internal consistency and reliability of the questionnaire, a confirmatory factor analysis, and the association between the different CEBQ scales and the children's BMI. A total of 197 children completed variables; 97 of them were boys (49.2%) and 100 girls (50.8%). Mean age of the total sample was 4.7 ± 0.9 years. There was a high test-re-test reliability of the questionnaire with values close to 1, with an average of 0.66 and a good internal consistency (Cronbach alpha with values above 0.7), so that a high reliability is established between the items in each scale.

35565780,Effect of a Six-Month Lifestyle Intervention on the Physical Activity and Fitness Status of Adults with NAFLD and Metabolic Syndrome.,"(1) Background: Physical inactivity has been linked to NAFLD, and exercise has been reported as useful to reduce intrahepatic fat content in NAFLD. (2) Objectives: To assess the physical activity (PA) and fitness status after a six-month lifestyle intervention (diet and PA) in adults with NAFLD and metabolic syndrome (MetS). (3) Design: Prospective cohort analysis of data obtained between baseline and six-year parallel-group randomized trial (n = 155, aged 40-60 years old, with MetS and NAFLD). Participants were randomized into three nutritional and PA intervention groups: Conventional diet (CD); MedDiet-high meal frequency (MD-HMF); MedDiet-physical activity (MD-PA). (4) Methods: PA and fitness status were assessed using a validated Minnesota questionnaire, ALPHA-FIT test battery, accelerometers, and functional fitness score. Information related to age, gender, education level, marital status, socioeconomic status, smoking habit, and alcohol consumption were also obtained. (5) Results: The CD group had higher improvement in standing handgrip than the MD-HMF group. The MD-PA group did more modified push-up repetitions than the CD group. The MD-PA and CD groups showed higher sitting handgrip than the MD-HMF group. The MD-HMF group showed the highest decrease in aerobic capacity. The MD-PA group showed lower light intensity PA/day than the CD and MD-HMF groups. The MD-PA group showed higher moderate intensity PA than the CD and MD-HMF groups. The CD group reported more METs per day than the MD-HMF group. (6) Conclusions: Lifestyle six-month intervention with diet and regular PA improved functional fitness in middle-aged patients with NAFLD and MetS. Aerobic capacity improved in patients who followed a Mediterranean diet and regular training sessions at six months.",Mascaró CM; Bouzas C; Montemayor S; Casares M; Llompart I; Ugarriza L; Borràs PA; Martínez JA; Tur JA,Nutrients,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35565780/,0,0,0,0,1,1

The best treatment now is a healthy lifestyle with a Mediterranean diet and physical activity (PA). To assess the association between stages of hepatic steatosis and physical activity performance in adults with metabolic syndrome. Cross-sectional study in 155 participants (40-60 years old) with MetS, a diagnosis of NAFLD by magnetic resonance imaging and BMI (body mass index) between 27 and 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Stages of hepatic steatosis were assessed and defined according to the percentage of intrahepatic fat contents: stage 0 ≤ 6.4% (control group); stage 1 = 6.4-17.4%; stage 2 ≥ 17.4%. Fitness was assessed through ALPHA-FIT test battery for adults, aerobic capacity by Chester-step test and PA by accelerometry and Minnesota questionnaire. Participants without NAFLD reported more years of education and major socioeconomic status than participants with NAFLD. A higher percentage of people in the most advanced stage of NAFLD were no smokers and no alcohol consumers. They also had higher stages of steatosis, lower sitting handgrip, standing handgrip, Chester step test values, sleep efficiency, and energy expenditure, and higher intensity of light and moderate physical activity, and self-reported physical activity.

35512761,Almond Consumption for 8 Weeks Altered Host and Microbial Metabolism in Comparison to a Control Snack in Young Adults.,"Almond consumption can improve cardiometabolic (CM) health. However, the mechanisms underlying those benefits are not well characterized. This study explored the effects of consuming a snack of almonds vs. crackers for 8 weeks on changes in metabolomic profiles in young adults (clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT03084003). Participants (n = 73, age: 18-19 years, BMI: 18-41 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were randomly assigned to consume either almonds (2 oz/d, n = 38) or an isocaloric control snack of graham crackers (325 kcal/d, n = 35) daily for 8 weeks. Blood samples were collected at baseline prior to and at 4 and 8 weeks after the intervention. Metabolite abundances in the serum were quantified by hydrophilic interaction chromatography quadrupole (Q) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS/MS), gas chromatography (GC) TOF MS, CSH-ESI (electrospray) QTOF MS/MS, and targeted analyses for free PUFAs, total fatty acids, oxylipins and endocannabinoids. Linear mixed model analyses with baseline-adjustment were conducted, and those results were used for enrichment and network analyses. Microbial community pathway predictions from 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples was done using PICRUST2. Almond consumption enriched unsaturated triglycerides, unsaturated phosphatidylcholines, saturated and unsaturated lysophosphatidylcholines, tricarboxylic acids, and tocopherol clusters (p < 0.05). Targeted analyses reveal lower levels of omega-3 total fatty acids (TFAs) overall in the almond group compared to the cracker group (p < 0.05). Microbial amino acid biosynthesis, and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism pathways were also differentially enriched at the end of the intervention (p < 0.05). The study demonstrates the differential effects of almonds on host tocopherol, lipid, and TCA cycle metabolism with potential changes in microbial metabolism, which may interact with host metabolism to facilitate the CM benefits.",Dhillon J; Newman JW; Fiehn O; Ortiz RM,Journal of the American Nutrition Association,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35512761/,0,0,0,0,1,0
35307761,"Associations between dietary patterns, FTO genotype and obesity in adults from seven European countries.","High-fat and low-fibre discretionary food intake and FTO genotype are each associated independently with higher risk of obesity. However, few studies have investigated links between obesity and dietary patterns based on discretionary food intake, and the interaction effect of FTO genotype are unknown. Thus, this study aimed to derive dietary patterns based on intake of discretionary foods, saturated fatty acids (SFA) and fibre, and examine cross-sectional associations with BMI and waist circumference (WC), and interaction effects of FTO genotype. Baseline data on 1280 adults from seven European countries were included (the Food4Me study). Dietary intake was estimated from a Food Frequency Questionnaire. Reduced rank regression was used to derive three dietary patterns using response variables of discretionary foods, SFA and fibre density. DNA was extracted from buccal swabs. Anthropometrics were self-measured. Linear regression analyses were used to examine associations between dietary patterns and BMI and WC, with an interaction for FTO genotype. Dietary pattern 1 (positively correlated with discretionary foods and SFA, and inversely correlated with fibre) was associated with higher BMI (β:0.64; 95% CI 0.44, 0.84) and WC (β:1.58; 95% CI 1.08, 2.07). There was limited evidence dietary pattern 2 (positively correlated with discretionary foods and SFA) and dietary pattern 3 (positively correlated with SFA and fibre) were associated with anthropometrics. FTO risk genotype was associated with higher BMI and WC, with no evidence of a dietary interaction. Consuming a dietary pattern low in discretionary foods and high-SFA and low-fibre foods is likely to be important for maintaining a healthy weight, regardless of FTO predisposition to obesity.

35294009,Sex Differences Across the Life Course: A Focus On Unique Nutritional and Health Considerations among Women.,"In the United States, women, while having a longer life expectancy than men, experience a differential risk for chronic diseases and have unique nutritional needs based on physiological and hormonal changes across the life span. However, much of what is known about health is based on research conducted in men. Additional complexity in assessing nutritional needs within gender include the variations in genetics, body compositions, hormonal milieus, underlying chronic diseases, and medication usage, with this list expanding as we consider these variables across the life course. It is clear women experience nutrient shortfalls during key periods of their lives, which may differentially impact their health. Consequently, as we move into the era of precision nutrition, understanding these sex- and gender-based differences may help optimize recommendations and interventions chosen to support health and weight management. Recently, a scientific conference was convened with content experts to explore these topics from a life-course perspective at biological, physiological, and behavioral levels. This publication summarizes the presentations and discussions from the workshop and provides an overview of important nutrition and related lifestyle considerations across the life course. The landscape of addressing female-specific nutritional needs continues to grow; now more than ever, it is essential to increase our understanding of the physiological differences between men and women, and determine how these physiological considerations may aid in optimizing nutritional strategies to support certain personal goals related to health, quality of life, sleep, and exercise performance among women.",Bailey RL; Dog TL; Smith-Ryan AE; Das SK; Baker FC; Madak-Erdogan Z; Hammond BR; Sesso HD; Eapen A; Mitmesser SH; Wong A; Nguyen H,The Journal of nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35294009/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Objectives: To assess the association between physical activity and NAFLD in adults with MetS. Design: Cross-sectional study in 155 participants (40−60 years old) from Balearic Islands and Navarra (Spain) with diagnosis of NAFLD and MetS, and BMI (body mass index) between 27 and 40 Kg/m2. Methods: PA level was categorized into two groups according to weekly METs (metabolic equivalents of tasks). PA was assessed using a validated Minnesota questionnaire and accelerometers. MetS parameters were assessed by blood collection analysis and NAFLD by abdominal MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Results: Participants with high PA showed more energy expenditure and expended more calories than ingested (−143.9 Kcal/day; p < 0.001). PA was a risk factor for AST (aspartate aminotransferase) (adjusted OR: 7.26; 95% CI: 1.79−29.40) and a protective factor for ALT (alanine aminotransferase) (adjusted OR: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.12−0.48), GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase) (adjusted OR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.29−0.94) and IFC-NMR (intrahepatic fat content by nuclear magnetic resonance) (adjusted OR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.12−0.56) when sociodemographic confounders were considered.

35265654,Genetically-Guided Medical Nutrition Therapy in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Pre-diabetes: A Series of <i>n</i>-of-1 Superiority Trials.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a heterogeneous metabolic disorder of multifactorial etiology that includes genetic and dietary influences. By addressing the latter, medical nutrition therapy (MNT) contributes to the management of T2DM or pre-diabetes toward achieving glycaemic control and improved insulin sensitivity. However, the clinical outcomes of MNT vary and may further benefit from personalized nutritional plans that take into consideration genetic variations associated with individual responses to macronutrients. The aim of the present series of <i>n</i>-of-1 trials was to assess the effects of genetically-guided vs. conventional MNT on patients with pre-diabetes or T2DM. A quasi-experimental, cross-over design was adopted in three Caucasian adult men with either diagnosis. Complete diet, bioclinical and anthropometric assessment was performed and a conventional MNT, based on the clinical practice guidelines was applied for 8 weeks. After a week of ""wash-out,"" a precision MNT was prescribed for an additional 8-week period, based on the genetic characteristics of each patient. Outcomes of interest included changes in body weight (BW), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and blood pressure (BP). Collectively, the trials indicated improvements in BW, FPG, BP, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) following the genetically-guided precision MNT intervention. Moreover, both patients with pre-diabetes experienced remission of the condition. We conclude that improved BW loss and glycemic control can be achieved in patients with pre-diabetes/T2DM, by coupling MNT to their genetic makeup, guiding optimal diet, macronutrient composition, exercise and oral nutrient supplementation in a personalized manner.",Gkouskou KK; Grammatikopoulou MG; Lazou E; Sanoudou D; Goulis DG; Eliopoulos AG,Frontiers in nutrition,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35265654/,0,0,0,0,0,0
35263691,Animal-based food choice and associations with long-term weight maintenance and metabolic health after a large and rapid weight loss: The PREVIEW study.,"Low-energy diet replacement is an effective tool to induce large and rapid weight loss and improve metabolic health, but in the long-term individuals often experience significant weight regain. Little is known about the role of animal-based foods in weight maintenance and metabolic health. We aimed to examine longitudinal associations of animal-based foods with weight maintenance and glycaemic and cardiometabolic risk factors. We also modelled replacement of processed meat with other high-protein foods. In this secondary analysis, longitudinal data were analysed from 688 adults (26-70 years) with overweight and prediabetes after 8-week low-energy diet-induced weight loss (≥8% of initial body weight) in a 3-year, multi-centre, diabetes prevention study (PREVIEW). Animal-based food consumption, including unprocessed red meat, processed red meat, poultry, dairy products, fish and seafood, and eggs, was repeatedly assessed using 4-day food records. Multi-adjusted linear mixed models and isoenergetic substitution models were used to examine the potential associations. The available-case analysis showed that each 10-g increment in processed meat, but not total meat, unprocessed red meat, poultry, dairy products, or eggs, was positively associated with weight regain (0.17 kg⋅year<sup>-1</sup>, 95% CI 0.10, 0.25, P < 0.001) and increments in waist circumference, HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and triacylglycerols. The associations of processed meat with HbA<sub>1c</sub> or triacylglycerols disappeared when adjusted for weight change. Fish and seafood consumption was inversely associated with triacylglycerols and triacylglycerol-glucose index, independent of weight change. Modelled replacement of processed meat with isoenergetic (250-300 kJ·day<sup>-1</sup> or 60-72 kcal·day<sup>-1</sup>) dairy, poultry, fish and seafood, grains, or nuts was associated with -0.59 (95% CI -0.77, -0.41), -0.66 (95% CI -0.93, -0.40), -0.58 (95% CI -0.88, -0.27), and -0.69 (95% CI -0.96, -0.41) kg·year<sup>-1</sup> of weight regain, respectively (all P < 0.001) and significant improvements in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and triacylglycerols. Higher intake of processed meat, but not total or unprocessed red meat, poultry, dairy products, or eggs may be associated with greater weight regain and more adverse glycaemic and cardiometabolic risk factors. Replacing processed meat with a wide variety of high-protein foods, including unprocessed red meat, poultry, dairy products, fish, eggs, grains, and nuts, could improve weight maintenance and metabolic health after rapid weight loss.

We aimed to investigate longitudinal associations of quantity and quality of carbohydrate sources with changes in subjective appetite sensations during WLM. This secondary analysis evaluated longitudinal data from the 3-year WLM phase of the PREVIEW study, a 2 × 2 factorial (diet-physical activity arms), multi-center, randomized trial. 1279 individuals with overweight or obesity and prediabetes (25-70 years; BMI≥25 kg m<sup>-2</sup>) were included. Individuals were merged into 1 group to assess longitudinal associations of yearly changes in appetite sensations. Quantity and quality of carbohydrate sources including total carbohydrate, glycemic index (GI), glycemic load (GL), and total dietary fiber were assessed via 4-day food diaries at 4 timepoints (26, 52, 104, and 156 weeks) during WLM. Visual analog scales were used to assess appetite sensations in the previous week. During WLM, participants consumed on average 160.6 (25th, 75th percentiles 131.1, 195.8) g·day<sup>-1</sup> of total carbohydrate, with GI 53.8 (48.7, 58.8) and GL 85.3 (67.2, 108.9) g day<sup>-1</sup>, and 22.3 (17.6, 27.3) g·day<sup>-1</sup> of dietary fiber. In the available-case analysis, multivariable-adjusted linear mixed models with repeated measures showed that each 30-g increment in total carbohydrate was associated with increases in hunger (1.36 mm year<sup>-1</sup>, 95% CI 0.77, 1.95, P < 0.001), desire to eat (1.10 mm year<sup>-1</sup>, 0.59, 1.60, P < 0.001), desire to eat something sweet (0.99 mm year<sup>-1</sup>, 0.30, 1.68, P = 0.005), and weight regain (0.20%·year<sup>-1</sup>, 0.03, 0.36, P = 0.022). Increasing GI was associated with weight regain, but not associated with increases in appetite sensations. Each 20-unit increment in GL was associated with increases in hunger (0.92 mm year<sup>-1</sup>, 0.33, 1.51, P = 0.002), desire to eat (1.12 mm year<sup>-1</sup>, 0.62, 1.62, P < 0.001), desire to eat something sweet (1.13 mm year<sup>-1</sup>, 0.44, 1.81, P < 0.001), and weight regain (0.35%·year<sup>-1</sup>, 0.18, 0.52, P < 0.001). Surprisingly, dietary fiber was also associated with increases in desire to eat, after adjustment for carbohydrate or GL. In participants with moderate carbohydrate and dietary fiber intake, and low to moderate GI, we found that higher total carbohydrate, GL, and total fiber, but not GI, were associated with increases in subjective desire to eat or hunger over 3 years.

34836170,Adherence to a Plant-Based Diet and Consumption of Specific Plant Foods-Associations with 3-Year Weight-Loss Maintenance and Cardiometabolic Risk Factors: A Secondary Analysis of the PREVIEW Intervention Study.,"Plant-based diets are recommended by dietary guidelines. This secondary analysis aimed to assess longitudinal associations of an overall plant-based diet and specific plant foods with weight-loss maintenance and cardiometabolic risk factors. Longitudinal data on 710 participants (aged 26-70 years) with overweight or obesity and pre-diabetes from the 3-year weight-loss maintenance phase of the PREVIEW intervention were analyzed. Adherence to an overall plant-based diet was evaluated using a novel plant-based diet index, where all plant-based foods received positive scores and all animal-based foods received negative scores. After adjustment for potential confounders, linear mixed models with repeated measures showed that the plant-based diet index was inversely associated with weight regain, but not with cardiometabolic risk factors. Nut intake was inversely associated with regain of weight and fat mass and increments in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Fruit intake was inversely associated with increments in diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol. Vegetable intake was inversely associated with an increment in diastolic blood pressure and triglycerides and was positively associated with an increase in HDL cholesterol. All reported associations with cardiometabolic risk factors were independent of weight change. Long-term consumption of nuts, fruits, and vegetables may be beneficial for weight management and cardiometabolic health, whereas an overall plant-based diet may improve weight management only.",Zhu R; Fogelholm M; Poppitt SD; Silvestre MP; Møller G; Huttunen-Lenz M; Stratton G; Sundvall J; Råman L; Jalo E; Taylor MA; Macdonald IA; Handjiev S; Handjieva-Darlenska T; Martinez JA; Muirhead R; Brand-Miller J; Raben A,Nutrients,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34836170/,0,0,0,0,1,1

34790686,Appraisal of Triglyceride-Related Markers as Early Predictors of Metabolic Outcomes in the PREVIEW Lifestyle Intervention: A Controlled <i>Post-hoc</i> Trial.,"<b>Background:</b> Individuals with pre-diabetes are commonly overweight and benefit from dietary and physical activity strategies aimed at decreasing body weight and hyperglycemia. Early insulin resistance can be estimated <i>via</i> the triglyceride glucose index {TyG = Ln [TG (mg/dl) × fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (mg/dl)/2]} and the hypertriglyceridemic-high waist phenotype (TyG-waist), based on TyG x waist circumference (WC) measurements. Both indices may be useful for implementing personalized metabolic management. In this secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we aimed to determine whether the differences in baseline TyG values and TyG-waist phenotype predicted individual responses to type-2 diabetes (T2D) prevention programs. <b>Methods:</b> The present <i>post-hoc</i> analyses were conducted within the Prevention of Diabetes through Lifestyle intervention and population studies in Europe and around the world (PREVIEW) study completers (<i>n</i> = 899), a multi-center RCT conducted in eight countries (NCT01777893). The study aimed to reduce the incidence of T2D in a population with pre-diabetes during a 3-year randomized intervention with two sequential phases. The first phase was a 2-month weight loss intervention to achieve ≥8% weight loss. The second phase was a 34-month weight loss maintenance intervention with two diets providing different amounts of protein and different glycemic indices, and two physical activity programs with different exercise intensities in a 2 x 2 factorial design. On investigation days, we assessed anthropometrics, glucose/lipid metabolism markers, and diet and exercise questionnaires under standardized procedures. <b>Results:</b> Diabetes-related markers improved during all four lifestyle interventions. Higher baseline TyG index (<i>p</i> < 0.001) was associated with greater reductions in body weight, fasting glucose, and triglyceride (TG), while a high TyG-waist phenotype predicted better TG responses, particularly in those randomized to physical activity (PA) of moderate intensity. <b>Conclusions:</b> Two novel indices of insulin resistance (TyG and TyG-waist) may allow for a more personalized approach to avoiding progression to T2D. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01777893 reference, identifier: NCT01777893.",Navas-Carretero S; San-Cristobal R; Siig Vestentoft P; Brand-Miller JC; Jalo E; Westerterp-Plantenga M; Simpson EJ; Handjieva-Darlenska T; Stratton G; Huttunen-Lenz M; Lam T; Muirhead R; Poppitt S; Pietiläinen KH; Adam T; Taylor MA; Handjiev S; McNarry MA; Hansen S; Brodie S; Silvestre MP; Macdonald IA; Boyadjieva N; Mackintosh KA; Schlicht W; Liu A; Larsen TM; Fogelholm M; Raben A; Martinez JA,Frontiers in nutrition,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34790686/,0,0,0,0,0,0
34453322,The triglyceride-glucose index as an adiposity marker and a predictor of fat loss induced by a low-calorie diet.,"This study aimed to investigate the putative role of the triglyceride-glucose index (TyG index) computed as ln[TG (mg/dl) × glucose (mg/dl)/2] and derived proxies as predictors of adiposity and weight loss changes after a low-calorie diet (LCD) intervention. A total of 744 adult participants from the multicentre DIOGenes intervention study were prescribed a LCD (800 kcal/day) during 8 weeks. Body composition and fat content at baseline and after 8 weeks were estimated by DEXA/BIA. A multivariate analysis approach was used to estimate the difference in ΔWeight<sub>1-2</sub> (kg), ΔBMI<sub>1-2</sub> (kg/m<sup>2</sup> ) or ΔFat<sub>1-2</sub> (%) between the basal value (point 1) and after 8 weeks following a LCD (point 2), respectively. The TyG index at baseline (TyG<sub>1</sub> ), after following the LCD for 8 weeks (TyG<sub>2</sub> ) or the TyG index differences between both time points (ΔTyG<sub>1-2</sub> ) were analysed as predictors of weight and fat changes. TyG<sub>1</sub> was associated with ΔWeight<sub>1-2</sub> (kg) and ΔBMI<sub>1-2</sub> (kg/m<sup>2</sup> ), with β = 0.812 (p = .017) and β = 0.265 (p = .018), respectively. Also, TyG<sub>2</sub>  values were inversely related to ΔFat<sub>1-2</sub> (%), β = -1.473 (p = .015).

Furthermore, an association between TyG<sub>2</sub> and resistance to fat loss was found (p = .015). TyG<sub>1</sub> index is a good predictor of weight loss induced by LCD. Moreover, TyG<sub>2</sub> was closely related to resistance to fat loss, while ΔTyG<sub>1-2</sub>  values were positively associated with body fat changes.

We aimed to assess associations of changes in both reported and estimated protein (PRep; PEst) and energy intake (EIRep; EIEst) with changes in HOMA-IR, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and BMI (in kg/m2), in 1822 decreasing to 833 adults (week 156) with overweight and prediabetes, during the 3-y PREVIEW (PREVention of diabetes through lifestyle intervention and population studies In Europe and around the World) study on weight-loss maintenance. Eating behavior and measurement errors (MEs) of dietary intake were assessed. Thus, observational post hoc analyses were applied. Associations of changes in EIEst, EIRep, PEst, and PRep with changes in HOMA-IR, HbA1c, and BMI were determined by linear mixed-model analysis in 2 arms [high-protein-low-glycemic-index (GI) diet and moderate-protein-moderate-GI diet] of the PREVIEW study. EIEst was derived from energy requirement: total energy expenditure = basal metabolic rate × physical activity level; PEst from urinary nitrogen, and urea. MEs were calculated as [(EIEst - EIRep)/EIEst] × 100% and [(PRep - PEst)/PEst] × 100%. Eating behavior was determined using the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire, examining cognitive dietary restraint, disinhibition, and hunger. Increases in PEst and PRep and decreases in EIEst and EIRep were associated with decreases in BMI, but not independently with decreases in HOMA-IR. Increases in PEst and PRep were associated with decreases in HbA1c. PRep and EIRep showed larger changes and stronger associations than PEst and EIEst. Mean ± SD MEs of EIRep and PRep were 38% ± 9% and 14% ± 4%, respectively; ME changes in EIRep and En% PRep were positively associated with changes in BMI and cognitive dietary restraint and inversely with disinhibition and hunger. During weight-loss maintenance in adults with prediabetes, increase in protein intake and decrease in energy intake were not associated with decrease in HOMA-IR beyond associations with decrease in BMI.

34366176,Physical activity and metabolic syndrome severity among older adults at cardiovascular risk: 1-Year trends.,"Modifiable lifestyle factors, such as physical activity (PA) and Mediterranean diet (MD), decrease metabolic syndrome (MetS). The aim was to assess 1-year changes of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA), sedentary behavior, and diet quality according to MetS severity in older population at high cardiovascular risk. Prospective analysis of 55-75-year-old 4359 overweight/obese participants with MetS (PREDIMED-Plus trial) categorized in tertiles according to 1-year changes of a validated MetS severity score (MetSSS). Anthropometrics, visceral adiposity index, triglycerides and glucose index, dietary nutrient intake, biochemical marker levels, dietary inflammatory index, and depression symptoms were measured. Diet quality was assessed by 17-item MD questionnaire. PAs were self-reported using the Minnesota-REGICOR Short Physical Activity Questionnaire and 30-s chair stand test. Sedentary behaviors were measured using the Spanish version of the Nurses' Health Study questionnaire. After 1-year follow-up, decreasing MetSSS was associated with an anti-inflammatory dietary pattern, high intake of vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, whole grain cereals, white fish, and bluefish and low intake of refined cereals, red and processed meat, cookies/sweets, and snacks/ready-to-eat-meals. It resulted in high intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega-3 fatty acids, protein, fiber, vitamins B1, B6, B9, C, D, potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus and low glycemic index and saturated fatty acid, trans fatty acid, and carbohydrates intake. Regarding PA and sedentary behavior, decreasing MetSSS was associated with increased moderate-to-vigorous LTPA, chair stand test, and decreased sedentary and TV-viewing time. Decreasing MetSSS was associated with an anti-inflammatory dietary pattern, high LTPA, high MD adherence, low sedentary time, and low depression risk.",Gallardo-Alfaro L; Bibiloni MDM; Bouzas C; Mascaró CM; Martínez-González MÁ; Salas-Salvadó J; Corella D; Schröder H; Martínez JA; Alonso-Gómez ÁM; Wärnberg J; Vioque J; Romaguera D; Lopez-Miranda J; Estruch R; Tinahones FJ; Lapetra J; Serra-Majem L; Bueno-Cavanillas A; Micó RM; Pintó X; Gaforio JJ; Ortíz-Ramos M; Altés-Boronat A; Luca BL; Daimiel L; Ros E; Sayon-Orea C; Becerra-Tomás N; Gimenez-Alba IM; Castañer O; Abete I; Tojal-Sierra L; Pérez-López J; Torres-Collado L; Colom A; Garcia-Rios A; Castro-Barquero S; Bernal R; Santos-Lozano JM; Fernandez-Lazaro CI; Hernández-Alonso P; Saiz C; Zomeño MD; Zulet MA; Belló-Mora MC; Basterra-Gortari FJ; Canudas S; Goday A; Tur JA,"Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34366176/,0,0,0,0,0,1
34277687,"The PERSonalized Glucose Optimization Through Nutritional Intervention (PERSON) Study: Rationale, Design and Preliminary Screening Results.","<b>Background:</b> It is well-established that the etiology of type 2 diabetes differs between individuals. Insulin resistance (IR) may develop in different tissues, but the severity of IR may differ in key metabolic organs such as the liver and skeletal muscle. Recent evidence suggests that these distinct tissue-specific IR phenotypes may also respond differentially to dietary macronutrient composition with respect to improvements in glucose metabolism. <b>Objective:</b> The main objective of the PERSON study is to investigate the effects of an optimal vs. suboptimal dietary macronutrient intervention according to tissue-specific IR phenotype on glucose metabolism and other health outcomes. <b>Methods:</b> In total, 240 overweight/obese (BMI 25 - 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) men and women (age 40 - 75 years) with either skeletal muscle insulin resistance (MIR) or liver insulin resistance (LIR) will participate in a two-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel, 12-week dietary intervention study. At screening, participants undergo a 7-point oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to determine the hepatic insulin resistance index (HIRI) and muscle insulin sensitivity index (MISI), classifying each participant as either ""No MIR/LIR,"" ""MIR,"" ""LIR,"" or ""combined MIR/LIR."" Individuals with MIR or LIR are randomized to follow one of two isocaloric diets varying in macronutrient content and quality, that is hypothesized to be either an optimal or suboptimal diet, depending on their tissue-specific IR phenotype (MIR/LIR). Extensive measurements in a controlled laboratory setting as well as phenotyping in daily life are performed before and after the intervention. The primary study outcome is the difference in change in disposition index, which is the product of insulin sensitivity and first-phase insulin secretion, between participants who received their hypothesized optimal or suboptimal diet. <b>Discussion:</b> The PERSON study is one of the first randomized clinical trials in the field of precision nutrition to test effects of a more personalized dietary intervention based on IR phenotype. The results of the PERSON study will contribute knowledge on the effectiveness of targeted nutritional strategies to the emerging field of precision nutrition, and improve our understanding of the complex pathophysiology of whole body and tissue-specific IR. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03708419, clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03708419.",Gijbels A; Trouwborst I; Jardon KM; Hul GB; Siebelink E; Bowser SM; Yildiz D; Wanders L; Erdos B; Thijssen DHJ; Feskens EJM; Goossens GH; Afman LA; Blaak EE,Frontiers in nutrition,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34277687/,0,0,0,0,0,0
34141717,"A High-Protein, Low Glycemic Index Diet Suppresses Hunger but Not Weight Regain After Weight Loss: Results From a Large, 3-Years Randomized Trial (PREVIEW).","<b>Background:</b> Previous studies have shown an increase in hunger during weight-loss maintenance (WLM) after diet-induced weight loss. Whether a combination of a higher protein, lower glycemic index (GI) diet and physical activity (PA) can counteract this change remains unclear. <b>Aim:</b> To compare the long-term effects of two diets [high protein (HP)-low GI vs. moderate protein (MP)-moderate GI] and two PA programs [high intensity (HI) vs. moderate intensity (MI)] on subjective appetite sensations during WLM after ≥8% weight loss (WL). <b>Methods:</b> Data derived from the 3-years PREVIEW randomized intervention study. An 8-weeks WL phase using a low-energy diet was followed by a 148-weeks randomized WLM phase. For the WLM phase, participants were assigned to one of the four groups: HP-MI, HP-HI, MP-MI, and MP-HI. Available data from 2,223 participants with overweight or obesity (68% women; BMI ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Appetite sensations including satiety, hunger, desire to eat, and desire to eat something sweet during the two phases (at 0, 8 weeks and 26, 52, 104, and 156 weeks) were assessed based on the recall of feelings during the previous week using visual analogue scales. Differences in changes in appetite sensations from baseline between the groups were determined using linear mixed models with repeated measures. <b>Results:</b> There was no significant diet × PA interaction. From 52 weeks onwards, decreases in hunger were significantly greater in HP-low GI than MP-moderate GI (<i>P</i> <sub>time × <i>diet</i></sub> = 0.018, <i>P</i> <sub>dietgroup</sub> = 0.021). Although there was no difference in weight regain between the diet groups (<i>P</i> <sub>time × <i>diet</i></sub> = 0.630), hunger and satiety ratings correlated with changes in body weight at most timepoints. There were no significant differences in appetite sensations between the two PA groups. Decreases in hunger ratings were greater at 52 and 104 weeks in HP-HI vs. MP-HI, and greater at 104 and 156 weeks in HP-HI vs. MP-MI. <b>Conclusions:</b> This is the first long-term, large-scale randomized intervention to report that a HP-low GI diet was superior in preventing an increase in hunger, but not weight regain, during 3-years WLM compared with a MP-moderate GI diet. Similarly, HP-HI outperformed MP-HI in suppressing hunger.

34092234,Personalised nutrition advice reduces intake of discretionary foods and beverages: findings from the Food4Me randomised controlled trial.,"The effect of personalised nutrition advice on discretionary foods intake is unknown. To date, two national classifications for discretionary foods have been derived. This study examined changes in intake of discretionary foods and beverages following a personalised nutrition intervention using these two classifications. Participants were recruited into a 6-month RCT across seven European countries (Food4Me) and were randomised to receive generalised dietary advice (control) or one of three levels of personalised nutrition advice (based on diet [L1], phenotype [L2] and genotype [L3]). Dietary intake was derived from an FFQ. An analysis of covariance was used to determine intervention effects at month 6 between personalised nutrition (overall and by levels) and control on i) percentage energy from discretionary items and ii) percentage contribution of total fat, SFA, total sugars and salt to discretionary intake, defined by Food Standards Scotland (FSS) and Australian Dietary Guidelines (ADG) classifications. Of the 1607 adults at baseline, n = 1270 (57% female) completed the intervention. Percentage sugars from FSS discretionary items was lower in personalised nutrition vs control (19.0 ± 0.37 vs 21.1 ± 0.65; P = 0.005). Percentage energy (31.2 ± 0.59 vs 32.7 ± 0.59; P = 0.031), percentage total fat (31.5 ± 0.37 vs 33.3 ± 0.65; P = 0.021), SFA (36.0 ± 0.43 vs 37.8 ± 0.75; P = 0.034) and sugars (31.7 ± 0.44 vs 34.7 ± 0.78; P < 0.001) from ADG discretionary items were lower in personalised nutrition vs control. There were greater reductions in ADG percentage energy and percentage total fat, SFA and salt for those randomised to L3 vs L2. Compared with generalised dietary advice, personalised nutrition advice achieved greater reductions in discretionary foods intake when the classification included all foods high in fat, added sugars and salt. Future personalised nutrition approaches may be used to target intake of discretionary foods. Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01530139 .

34088702,Association of Psychobehavioral Variables With HOMA-IR and BMI Differs for Men and Women With Prediabetes in the PREVIEW Lifestyle Intervention.,"Stress, sleep, eating behavior, and physical activity are associated with weight change and insulin resistance (IR). The aim of this analysis was the assessment of the overall and sex-specific associations of psychobehavioral variables throughout the 3-year PREVIEW intervention using the homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR), BMI, and length of time in the study. Associations of psychobehavioral variables, including stress, mood, eating behavior, physical activity (PA), and sleep, with BMI, HOMA-IR, and time spent in the study were assessed in 2,184 participants with prediabetes and overweight/obesity (<i>n</i> = 706 men; <i>n</i> = 1,478 women) during a 3-year lifestyle intervention using linear mixed modeling and general linear modeling. The study was a randomized multicenter trial using a 2 × 2 diet-by-PA design. Overall, cognitive restraint and PA increased during the intervention compared with baseline, whereas BMI, HOMA-IR, disinhibition, hunger, and sleepiness decreased (all <i>P</i> < 0.05). Cognitive restraint and PA were negatively, whereas disinhibition, hunger, stress, and total mood disturbance were positively, associated with both BMI and HOMA-IR. Sleep duration, low sleep quality, total mood disturbance, disinhibition, and hunger scores were positively associated with HOMA-IR for men only. Participants who dropped out at 6 months had higher stress and total mood disturbance scores at baseline and throughout their time spent in the study compared with study completers.

In this secondary analysis we used pooled data from the PREVention of diabetes through lifestyle Intervention and population studies in Europe and around the World (PREVIEW) randomized controlled trial, which was designed to test the effects of four diet and physical activity interventions. A total of 1,279 participants with overweight or obesity (age 25-70 years and BMI ≥25 kg ⋅ m<sup>-2</sup>) and prediabetes at baseline were included. We used multiadjusted linear mixed models with repeated measurements to assess longitudinal and dose-dependent associations by merging the participants into one group and dividing them into GI, GL, and fiber tertiles, respectively.

33849843,Leveraging Genomic Associations in Precision Digital Care for Weight Loss: Cohort Study.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgency of addressing an epidemic of obesity and associated inflammatory illnesses. Previous studies have demonstrated that interactions between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and lifestyle interventions such as food and exercise may vary metabolic outcomes, contributing to obesity. However, there is a paucity of research relating outcomes from digital therapeutics to the inclusion of genetic data in care interventions. This study aims to describe and model the weight loss of participants enrolled in a precision digital weight loss program informed by the machine learning analysis of their data, including genomic data. It was hypothesized that weight loss models would exhibit a better fit when incorporating genomic data versus demographic and engagement variables alone. A cohort of 393 participants enrolled in Digbi Health's personalized digital care program for 120 days was analyzed retrospectively. The care protocol used participant data to inform precision coaching by mobile app and personal coach. Linear regression models were fit of weight loss (pounds lost and percentage lost) as a function of demographic and behavioral engagement variables. Genomic-enhanced models were built by adding 197 SNPs from participant genomic data as predictors and refitted using Lasso regression on SNPs for variable selection. Success or failure logistic regression models were also fit with and without genomic data. Overall, 72.0% (n=283) of the 393 participants in this cohort lost weight, whereas 17.3% (n=68) maintained stable weight. A total of 142 participants lost 5% bodyweight within 120 days. Models described the impact of demographic and clinical factors, behavioral engagement, and genomic risk on weight loss. Incorporating genomic predictors improved the mean squared error of weight loss models (pounds lost and percent) from 70 to 60 and 16 to 13, respectively. The logistic model improved the pseudo R<sup>2</sup> value from 0.193 to 0.285. Gender, engagement, and specific SNPs were significantly associated with weight loss. SNPs within genes involved in metabolic pathways processing food and regulating fat storage were associated with weight loss in this cohort: rs17300539_G (insulin resistance and monounsaturated fat metabolism), rs2016520_C (BMI, waist circumference, and cholesterol metabolism), and rs4074995_A (calcium-potassium transport and serum calcium levels). The models described greater average weight loss for participants with more risk alleles. Notably, coaching for dietary modification was personalized to these genetic risks. Including genomic information when modeling outcomes of a digital precision weight loss program greatly enhanced the model accuracy. Interpretable weight loss models indicated the efficacy of coaching informed by participants' genomic risk, accompanied by active engagement of participants in their own success. Although large-scale validation is needed, our study preliminarily supports precision dietary interventions for weight loss using genetic risk, with digitally delivered recommendations alongside health coaching to improve intervention efficacy.",Sinha R; Kachru D; Ricchetti RR; Singh-Rambiritch S; Muthukumar KM; Singaravel V; Irudayanathan C; Reddy-Sinha C; Junaid I; Sharma G; Francis-Lyon PA,Journal of medical Internet research,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33849843/,0,0,0,0,0,0
33693782,Anthropometric Variables as Mediators of the Association of Changes in Diet and Physical Activity With Inflammatory Profile.,"Mechanisms underlying the associations of high levels of physical activity (PA) and adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) with a better inflammatory profile remain unclear. Our objective was to assess the mediating role of changes in body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC), as markers of body fat in the association of changes in PA and adherence to the MedDiet, with changes in the inflammatory profile. This study included 489 adults, aged 55-75 years, from the PREDIMED-Plus multicenter lifestyle intervention trial. An inflammatory score was calculated, based on 8 blood biomarkers: high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, interleukin 18, monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1, C-peptide, leptin, and regulated on activation, normal T-cell-expressed and secreted chemokine. Biomarkers, levels of PA, score of MedDiet adherence, BMI, and WC were measured at baseline and at 1-year follow-up. Linear regression models were fitted according to the Baron and Kenny framework for mediation analysis. Changes in BMI and WC mediated the association of both changes in PA and changes in the MedDiet adherence with the inflammatory score. Body mass index mediated 26% of the association of changes in total PA with the inflammatory profile, and 27% of the association of changes in the MedDiet, while WC mediated 13% and 12% of these associations, respectively. In older adults at high cardiovascular risk, increasing PA levels and adherence to a MedDiet during 1 year were associated with a lower inflammatory score, which was partly mediated by a reduction in body fat.

33672073,Energy Expenditure Improved Risk Factors Associated with Renal Function Loss in NAFLD and MetS Patients.,"To assess the efficacy of three lifestyle interventions on the reduction of liver fat content and metabolic syndrome (MetS), and whether such reductions would influence renal outcomes, we conducted a randomized controlled trial on 128 participants with MetS and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), as well as available data on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urinary albumin-to-creatine ratio (UACR). Patients were randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to either Conventional Diet, Mediterranean diet (MD)-high meal frequency, and MD-physical activity groups. Each intervention aimed at reducing caloric intake by 25%-30% of baseline intake and increase energy expenditure by 400 kcal/70 kg. Patients attended regular visits and were followed-up for 6 months. Increased albuminuria was present in 13.3% of patients, while 32.8% showed hyperfiltration. UACR reduction was associated with higher levels of UACR at baseline but not with changes in liver fat. eGFR decreased in patients presenting hyperfiltration at baseline and was associated with reduction in liver fat and insulin resistance, as well as with increase in energy expenditure (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.248, <i>p</i> = 0.006). No significant differences were observed between the three treatment groups. In patients with NAFLD and MetS, energy expenditure significantly reduced hepatic fat accumulation and insulin resistance, which reduced glomerular hyperfiltration.

Meals were fed to 12 healthy men [means ± SD, age 31.3 ± 9.2 yr, body mass index (BMI) 24.5 ± 1.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>] during four randomized study visits; the HF meal was administered twice for reproducibility. Blood was collected over 8 h postprandially, triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins (TRL), and particles with a Svedberg flotation rate >400 (<i>S</i><sub>f</sub> > 400, <i>n</i> = 8) were isolated by ultracentrifugation, and labeling of two TG species (54:3 and 52:2) was quantified by LC-MS. Total plasma TRL-TG concentrations were threefold greater than <i>S</i><sub>f</sub> > 400-TG. Both <i>S</i><sub>f</sub> > 400- and TRL-TG 54:3 were present at higher concentrations than 52:2, and singly labeled TG concentrations were higher than doubly labeled. Furthermore, TG 54:3 and the singly labeled molecules demonstrated higher plasma absolute entry rates differing significantly across fat levels within a single TG species (<i>P</i> < 0.01). Calculation of fractional entry showed no significant differences in label handling supporting the utility of either TG species for appearance rate calculations. These data demonstrate the utility of labeling research meals with stable isotopes to investigate human postprandial lipemia while simultaneously highlighting the importance of examining individual responses. Meal type and timing, control of prestudy activities, and effects of sex on outcomes should match the research goals. The method, optimized here, will be beneficial to conduct basic science research in precision nutrition and clinical drug development.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> A novel method to test human intestinal lipid handling using stable isotope labeling is presented and, for the first time, plasma appearance and lipid turnover were quantified in 12 healthy men following meals with varying amounts of fat.

Longitudinal analyses in the PREDIMED-Plus trial.,"The optimal distribution between physical activity (PA) levels and sedentary behaviour (SB) for the greatest benefits for body composition among older adults with overweight/obesity and chronic health conditions remains unclear. We aimed to determine the prospective association between changes in PA and in SB with concurrent changes in body composition and to examine whether reallocating inactive time into different physical activity levels was associated with 12-month change to body composition in older adults. Longitudinal assessment nested in the PREDIMED-Plus trial. A subsample (n = 1564) of men and women (age 55-75 years) with overweight/obesity and metabolic syndrome from both arms of the PREDIMED-Plus trial was included in the present analysis. Participants were followed up at 6 and 12 months. Physical activity and SB were assessed using validated questionnaires. Out of 1564 participants, 388 wore an accelerometer to objectively measure inactive time and PA over a 7-day period. At each time point, participants' body composition was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Standard covariate-adjusted and isotemporal substitution modelling were applied to linear mixed-effects models. Increasing 30 min of total PA and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was associated with significant reductions in body fat (β - 0.07% and - 0.08%) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) (- 13.9 g, and - 15.6 g) at 12 months (all p values < 0.001). Reallocating 30 min of inactive time to MVPA was associated with reductions in body fat and VAT and with an increase in muscle mass and muscle-to-fat mass ratio (all p values < 0.001). At 12 months, increasing total PA and MVPA and reducing total SB and TV-viewing SB were associated with improved body composition in participants with overweight or obesity, and metabolic syndrome. This was also observed when substituting 30 min of inactive time with total PA, LPA and MVPA, with the greatest benefits observed with MVPA.

33235060,Cross-sectional evaluation of the interaction between activity relative-time expenditure and comorbidity concerning physical quality of life.,"Quality of life (QoL) is a matter of concern in both healthy and diseased individuals. Lifestyle factors such as physical activity and sleep have a direct impact on QoL. In this context, interactions between activity time expenditure and QoL might be different in comorbid and non comorbid patients. Besides, the quantification and evaluation of time expenditure is ordinarily measured as the absolute time devoted to each activity. The objective of this study is the evaluation of the influence and interactions of activity-relative time expenditure and co-morbidity in Physical QoL.The study involved 302 consecutive patients, from an Internal Medicine ambulatory evaluation. Validated questionnaires were used to collect demographic variables and time expenditure variables. QoL was gathered with de survey short form-36questionnaire. Comorbidity was compiled with de Charlson Comorbidity Index. SPSS v20.0 was used for statistical analysis.As hypothesized, healthy subjects had higher Physical QoL score than comorbid subjects (P < .05). Physical activity and sleep relative time expenditure were statistically significant and associated to a better QoL in comorbid patients (P < .05). Interestingly, sleep was found to have statistically significant interaction with a score of ≥2 in the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Age, gender, comorbidity, physical activity relative time expenditure, and the interaction between relative time dedicated to sleep and comorbidity were found statistically significant in a multivariate model on Physical QoL prediction.Activity-relative time expenditure could be an adequate measure of daily activity pattern in the evaluation of QoL. Relative time spent in physical activity and sleep might be positively associated to Physical QoL. Sleep and comorbidity could have a statistically significant interaction in the prediction of Physical QoL.",Suarez-Villar R; Martinez-Urbistondo D; Fernandez MA; Lopez-Cano M; Fernandez E; Dominguez A; Prosper L; Rodriguez-Cobo A; Tinoco MEC; Nadal P; Risco CR; Fernández PV; Martínez JA,Medicine,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33235060/,0,0,0,0,0,0

A 3-year multicentre randomized trial in eight countries using a 2 x 2 diet-by-PA factorial design was conducted. Eight-week weight reduction was followed by a 3-year randomized weight-maintenance phase. In total, 2326 adults (age 25-70 years, body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ) with prediabetes were enrolled. The primary endpoint was 3-year incidence of T2D analysed by diet treatment. Secondary outcomes included glucose, insulin, HbA1c and body weight. The total number of T2D cases was 62 and the cumulative incidence rate was 3.1%, with no significant differences between the two diets, PA or their combination. T2D incidence was similar across intervention centres, irrespective of attrition. Significantly fewer participants achieved normoglycaemia in the HP compared with the MP group (P < .0001). At 3 years, normoglycaemia was lowest in HP-HI (11.9%) compared with the other three groups (20.0%-21.0%, P < .05). There were no group differences in body weight change (-11% after 8-week weight reduction; -5% after 3-year weight maintenance) or in other secondary outcomes. Three-year incidence of T2D was much lower than predicted and did not differ between diets, PA or their combination. Maintaining the target intakes of protein and GI over 3 years was difficult, but the overall protocol combining weight loss, healthy eating and PA was successful in markedly reducing the risk of T2D.

32708828,Adherence to the Mediterranean Lifestyle and Desired Body Weight Loss in a Mediterranean Adult Population with Overweight: A PREDIMED-Plus Study.,"Body weight dissatisfaction is a hindrance to following a healthy lifestyle and it has been associated with weight concerns. The aim of this study was to assess the association between the adherence to the Mediterranean lifestyle (diet and exercise) and the desired body weight loss in an adult Mediterranean population with overweight. Cross-sectional analysis in 6355 participants (3268 men; 3087 women) with metabolic syndrome and BMI (Body mass index) between 27.0 and 40.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (55-75 years old) from the PREDIMED-Plus trial. Desired weight loss was the percentage of weight that participants wished to lose. It was categorized into four cut-offs of this percentage (Q1: <10%, <i>n</i> = 1495; Q2: 10-15%, <i>n</i> = 1804; Q3: <15-20%, <i>n</i> = 1470; Q4: ≥20%, <i>n</i> = 1589). Diet was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire and a 17-item Mediterranean diet questionnaire. Physical activity was assessed by the validated Minnesota-REGICOR and the validated Spanish version of the Nurses' Health Study questionnaire. Participants reporting higher percentages of desired weight loss (Q3 and Q4) were younger, had higher real and perceived BMI and were more likely to have abdominal obesity. Desired weight loss correlated inversely to physical activity (Q1: 2106 MET min/week; Q4: 1585 MET min/week. <i>p</i> < 0.001) and adherence to Mediterranean diet (Q1: 8.7; Q4: 8.3. <i>p</i> < 0.001). In older Mediterranean individuals with weight excess, desired weight loss was inversely associated with Mediterranean lifestyle adherence. Deeply rooted aspects of the MedDiet remained similar across groups.

32486373,Nutritional Determinants of Quality of Life in a Mediterranean Cohort: The SUN Study.,"Health related quality of life (HRQoL) is a subjective appreciation of how personal characteristics and health influence well-being. This cross-sectional analysis aimed to quantitatively measure the influence of dietary, lifestyle, and demographic factors on HRQoL. A sub-sample of the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) Project, a Mediterranean cohort, was analyzed (n = 15,674). Through self-administered questionnaires the relationship between HRQoL and dietary patterns (Mediterranean-diet (MedDiet) and provegetarian food pattern (FP) assessment), lifestyles (sleeping hours, physical activity) and demographic characteristics were measured. Multivariate linear regression and flexible regression models were used to estimate the pondered effect of personal factors on Short Form-36 (SF-36) scores. Coefficients for MedDiet and provegetarian scores (β-coefficient for global SF-36 score: 0.32 (0.22, 0.42); 0.09 (0.06, 0.12) respectively for every unit increase), physical activity (β: 0.03 (0.02, 0.03) for every metabolic equivalent of task indexes (MET)-h/week) had a positive association to HRQoL. The female sex (β: -3.28 (-3.68, -2.89)), and pre-existing diseases (diabetes, β: -2.27 (-3.48, -1.06), hypertension β: -1.79 (-2.36, -1.22), hypercholesterolemia β: -1.04 (-1.48, -0.59)) account for lower SF-36 scores.

A total of 6875 subjects between 55 and 75 years of age with MetS were selected and randomized in 23 Spanish centers. Subjects were classified according to categories of body mass index (BMI). PA was measured with the validated Registre Gironí del Cor (REGICOR) questionnaire and subjects were classified according to their PA level (light, moderate, vigorous) and the HRQoL was measured with the validated short-form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire. By using the ANOVA model, we found a positive and statistically significant association between the level of PA and the HRQoL (aggregated physical and mental dimensions <i>p</i> < 0.001), but a negative association with higher BMI in aggregated physical dimensions <i>p</i> < 0.001. Furthermore, women obtained lower scores compared with men, more five points in all fields of SF-36.

32234083,Characteristics of participants who benefit most from personalised nutrition: findings from the pan-European Food4Me randomised controlled trial.,"Little is known about who would benefit from Internet-based personalised nutrition (PN) interventions. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of participants who achieved greatest improvements (i.e. benefit) in diet, adiposity and biomarkers following an Internet-based PN intervention. Adults (n 1607) from seven European countries were recruited into a 6-month, randomised controlled trial (Food4Me) and randomised to receive conventional dietary advice (control) or PN advice. Information on dietary intake, adiposity, physical activity (PA), blood biomarkers and participant characteristics was collected at baseline and month 6. Benefit from the intervention was defined as ≥5 % change in the primary outcome (Healthy Eating Index) and secondary outcomes (waist circumference and BMI, PA, sedentary time and plasma concentrations of cholesterol, carotenoids and omega-3 index) at month 6. For our primary outcome, benefit from the intervention was greater in older participants, women and participants with lower HEI scores at baseline. Benefit was greater for individuals reporting greater self-efficacy for 'sticking to healthful foods' and who 'felt weird if [they] didn't eat healthily'. Participants benefited more if they reported wanting to improve their health and well-being. The characteristics of individuals benefiting did not differ by other demographic, health-related, anthropometric or genotypic characteristics. Findings were similar for secondary outcomes. These findings have implications for the design of more effective future PN intervention studies and for tailored nutritional advice in public health and clinical settings.",Livingstone KM; Celis-Morales C; Navas-Carretero S; San-Cristobal R; Forster H; Woolhead C; O'Donovan CB; Moschonis G; Manios Y; Traczyk I; Gundersen TE; Drevon CA; Marsaux CFM; Fallaize R; Macready AL; Daniel H; Saris WHM; Lovegrove JA; Gibney M; Gibney ER; Walsh M; Brennan L; Martinez JA; Mathers JC,The British journal of nutrition,2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32234083/,0,0,0,0,1,0
32131847,Compositional analysis of the associations between 24-h movement behaviours and cardio-metabolic risk factors in overweight and obese adults with pre-diabetes from the PREVIEW study: cross-sectional baseline analysis.,"Physical activity, sedentary time and sleep have been shown to be associated with cardio-metabolic health. However, these associations are typically studied in isolation or without accounting for the effect of all movement behaviours and the constrained nature of data that comprise a finite whole such as a 24 h day. The aim of this study was to examine the associations between the composition of daily movement behaviours (including sleep, sedentary time (ST), light intensity physical activity (LIPA) and moderate-to-vigorous activity (MVPA)) and cardio-metabolic health, in a cross-sectional analysis of adults with pre-diabetes. Further, we quantified the predicted differences following reallocation of time between behaviours. Accelerometers were used to quantify daily movement behaviours in 1462 adults from eight countries with a body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg·m<sup>- 2</sup>, impaired fasting glucose (IFG; 5.6-6.9 mmol·l<sup>- 1</sup>) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; 7.8-11.0 mmol•l<sup>- 1</sup> 2 h following oral glucose tolerance test, OGTT). Compositional isotemporal substitution was used to estimate the association of reallocating time between behaviours. Replacing MVPA with any other behaviour around the mean composition was associated with a poorer cardio-metabolic risk profile. Conversely, when MVPA was increased, the relationships with cardiometabolic risk markers was favourable but with smaller predicted changes than when MVPA was replaced. Further, substituting ST with LIPA predicted improvements in cardio-metabolic risk markers, most notably insulin and HOMA-IR. This is the first study to use compositional analysis of the 24 h movement composition in adults with overweight/obesity and pre-diabetes. These findings build on previous literature that suggest replacing ST with LIPA may produce metabolic benefits that contribute to the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, the asymmetry in the predicted change in risk markers following the reallocation of time to/from MVPA highlights the importance of maintaining existing levels of MVPA.

It further examined the impact of reallocating inactive time to time in bed, light physical activity (LPA) or moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) on cardio-metabolic risk factors, including measures of adiposity and body composition, biochemical parameters and blood pressure in older adults. This is a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from 2189 Caucasian men and women (age 55-75 years, BMI 27-40 Kg/m<sup>2</sup>) from the PREDIMED-Plus study (http://www.predimedplus.com/). All participants had ≥3 components of the metabolic syndrome. Inactive time, physical activity and time in bed were objectively determined using triaxial accelerometers GENEActiv during 7 days (ActivInsights Ltd., Kimbolton, United Kingdom). Multiple adjusted linear and logistic regression models were used. Isotemporal substitution regression modelling was performed to assess the relationship of replacing the amount of time spent in one activity for another, on each outcome, including measures of adiposity and body composition, biochemical parameters and blood pressure in older adults. Inactive time was associated with indicators of obesity and the metabolic syndrome. Reallocating 30 min per day of inactive time to 30 min per day of time in bed was associated with lower BMI, waist circumference and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (all p-values < 0.05). Reallocating 30 min per day of inactive time with 30 min per day of LPA or MVPA was associated with lower BMI, waist circumference, total fat, visceral adipose tissue, HbA1c, glucose, triglycerides, and higher body muscle mass and HDL cholesterol (all p-values < 0.05). Inactive time was associated with a poor cardio-metabolic profile. Isotemporal substitution of inactive time with MVPA and LPA or time in bed could have beneficial impact on cardio-metabolic health.

31282167,Definition of nutritionally qualitative categorizing (proto)nutritypes and a pilot quantitative nutrimeter for mirroring nutritional well-being based on a quality of life health related questionnaire.,"Background: there are numerous approaches to assess nutritional status, which are putatively applied to nutritionally classify diseased people, but less information is available to study the role of environmental factors on nutritional well-being. A qualitative (nutritypes) and quantitative (nutrimeter) nutritional categorization based on dietary, lifestyle and disease criteria can be a useful nutritional approach to personalize health interventions and identify at risk individuals. Methods: cross-sectional study conducted on 102 patients (60 women), evaluating quality of life using the Short-Form 36 questionnaire (SF-36) and lifestyle factors with a general questionnaire, the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ). A nutrimeter based on physical activity, fat mass, diet and diseases (hypertension, prediabetes, obesity and dyslipidemia) data was defined with an equation to quantitatively score the nutritive well-being of the participants, and classify them into two (proto)nutritypes. Results: participants were categorized into two groups (lower/higher global health) according to quality of life. Significant or marginal statistical differences in physical activity, fat mass, diet and disease were found (all p < 0.1). Two (proto)nutritypes were identified based on participant's age, sex, fat mass, physical activity, diet and diseases. Participants classified as high nutritional well-being nutritype showed higher values for physical, mental and global health dimensions. Age, fat mass, physical activity and diet, when categorized by the median, confirm that the designed nutritional well-being nutrimeter identified two (proto)nutritypes.

A 6-month RCT (Food4Me) was conducted in seven European countries between 2012 and 2013. A total of 1,125 participants were randomized to Lower- (n=562) or Higher- (n=563) Frequency Feedback groups. Participants in the Lower-Frequency group received personalized nutritional advice at baseline and at Months 3 and 6 of the intervention, whereas the Higher-Frequency group received personalized nutritional advice at baseline and at Months 1, 2, 3 and 6. The primary outcomes were change in dietary intake (at food and nutrient levels) and obesity-related traits (body weight, BMI, and waist circumference). Participants completed an online Food Frequency Questionnaire to estimate usual dietary intake at baseline and at Months 3 and 6 of the intervention. Overall diet quality was evaluated using the 2010 Healthy Eating Index. Obesity-related traits were self-measured and reported by participants via the Internet. Statistical analyses were performed during the first quarter of 2018. At 3 months, participants in the Lower- and Higher-Frequency Feedback groups showed improvements in Healthy Eating Index score; this improvement was larger in the Higher-Frequency group than the Lower-Frequency group (Δ=1.84 points, 95% CI=0.79, 2.89, p=0.0001).

30257464,Determinants of Self-Rated Health Perception in a Sample of a Physically Active Population: PLENUFAR VI Study.,"The aim of this study was to investigate determinants of self-rated health (SRH) perception in Spanish adults. This cross-sectional study including data from 11,342 participants from the Spanish PLENUFAR VI study. SRH status was grouped in two categories ('good'/'poor') and the associations of socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyles, diet adequacy and chronic disease with SRH were assessed. After adjusting for relevant confounders, the risk ratios (RR) and (95% confidence intervals) for poor SRH were 1.05 (1.03⁻1.07) for each hour of increment of sitting, 1.56 (1.30⁻1.88) for short (≥5 h vs. 7⁻8 h) sleep duration, 0.63 (0.55⁻0.72) for vigorous (vs. light) physical activity, 0.61 (0.50⁻0.74) for adequate (vs. non-adequate) diet. Activities like jogging [RR for each unit of increment in the METs-h/day = 0.87 (0.82⁻0.92)], gymnastics [0.87 (0.81⁻0.93)], biking [0.91 (0.85⁻0.98)], and track and field [0.94 (0.89⁻0.98)], were associated with better health perception. Normally weight participants with any chronic disease had lower probability to report poor SRH than overweight/obese participants with any chronic disease. Frequent consumption of bread (>2 servings/day) was associated with a lower adjusted mean of health perception scale, while higher consumption of vegetables and fruit or fish were associated with higher values, concerning good SRH. We can conclude that normal-weight participants even suffering a chronic disease had lower probability to report poor health perception than participants with overweight/obesity and a chronic disease especially for hypertension and diabetes. Activities like jogging, gymnastics, biking, and track and field, and a higher consumption of fruits, vegetables and fish, were associated with better health rated perception.",Sayón-Orea C; Santiago S; Bes-Rastrollo M; Martínez-González MA; Pastor MR; Moreno-Aliaga MJ; Tur JA; Garcia A; Martínez JA,International journal of environmental research and public health,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30257464/,0,0,0,0,0,0
30122198,Zinc transporter SLC39A11 polymorphisms are associated with chronic gastritis in the Korean population: the possible effect on spicy food intake.,"Herein, we hypothesized that ZIP11 variants would be important risk factors for chronic gastritis and that there would be an interaction effect of the relationship between their variants and spicy food intake on the development of chronic gastritis. Participants in this cross-sectional study (n = 3882 + 252) were recruited from a cohort of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study in 2001. Age, sex, education, smoking and drinking status, exercise, stress, and income level of all participants were determined by a questionnaire. Demographic and anthropometric data were collected. Fasting blood samples were collected to determine the serum levels of glucose, insulin, total bilirubin, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. The presence of chronic gastritis was defined as a confirmed diagnosis by a physician. Food consumption was determined using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. We found 8 different single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are significantly different between subjects without gastritis and those with gastritis. Of these 8 SNPs, 3 SNP (rs17183225 [C/T], rs17780814 [A/C], and rs17780820 [A/G]) are closely located in the intronic region of zinc transporter SLC39A11, commonly known as ZIP11, and show linkage disequilibrium (D' = 1.0). We also found that participants with (TCA + TCG) haplotype of ZIP11 at high levels of dietary intake of spicy foods show a significantly increasing tendency in the odds of having chronic gastritis when compared with those with CAA haplotype (odds ratio, 2.620; 95% confidence interval, 1.207-5.689). The data indicate positive associations between higher meal frequency and lower spicy food preference and gastritis. In conclusion, we found that zinc transporter gene ZIP11 is associated with chronic gastritis in the Korean population and it may interact with spicy food, which suggests ZIP11 as a therapeutic target for precision nutrition.",Ha E; Bae JH,"Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)",2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30122198/,0,0,0,0,0,0
29233792,N-acetylcysteine supplementation increases exercise performance and reduces oxidative stress only in individuals with low levels of glutathione.,"Most of the evidence indicates that chronic antioxidant supplementation induces negative effects in healthy individuals. However, it is currently unknown whether specific redox deficiencies exist and whether targeted antioxidant interventions in deficient individuals can induce positive effects. We hypothesized that the effectiveness of antioxidant supplements to decrease oxidative stress and promote exercise performance depends on the redox status of the individuals that receive the antioxidant treatment. To this aim, we investigated whether N-acetylcysteine (NAC) supplementation would enhance exercise performance by increasing glutathione concentration and by reducing oxidative stress only in individuals with low resting levels of glutathione. We screened 100 individuals for glutathione levels and formed three groups with low, moderate and high levels (N = 36, 12 per group). After by-passing the regression to the mean artifact, by performing a second glutathione measurement, the individuals were supplemented with NAC (2 × 600mg, twice daily, for 30 days) or placebo using a double-blind cross-over design. We performed three whole-body performance tests (VO<sub>2</sub>max, time trial and Wingate), measured two systemic oxidative stress biomarkers (F<sub>2</sub>-isoprostanes and protein carbonyls) and assessed glutathione-dependent redox metabolism in erythrocytes (glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase, catalase and NADPH). The low glutathione group improved after NAC supplementation in VO<sub>2</sub>max, time trial and Wingate by 13.6%, 15.4% and 11.4%, respectively. Thirty days of NAC supplementation were sufficient to restore baseline glutathione concentration, reduce systemic oxidative stress and improve erythrocyte glutathione metabolism in the low glutathione group. On the contrary, the 30-day supplementation period did not affect performance and redox state of the moderate and high glutathione groups, although few both beneficial and detrimental effects in performance were observed. In conclusion, individuals with low glutathione levels were linked with decreased physical performance, increased oxidative stress and impaired redox metabolism of erythrocytes. NAC supplementation restored both performance and redox homeostasis.",Paschalis V; Theodorou AA; Margaritelis NV; Kyparos A; Nikolaidis MG,Free radical biology & medicine,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29233792/,0,0,0,0,0,0
28392934,Evaluation of a web-based weight loss intervention in overweight cancer survivors aged 50 years and younger.,"Half of adult cancer survivors under age 50 years are obese. Excess body weight is associated with cancer recurrence, and effective weight loss interventions for younger cancer survivors are needed. Commercially available, online weight loss programmes are readily accessible, but few have been studied in this population. This study employed a single-arm, pre-post intervention (baseline-6 month/baseline-12 month comparisons) to preliminarily explore feasibility, efficacy and safety of an online, commercially available weight loss programme in breast (<i>n</i> = 30) and testicular (<i>n</i> = 16) cancer survivors under age 50 years. The intervention included three daily components: exercise, nutritional/behavioural modification strategies and health lessons. Intention-to-treat and completers analyses were conducted. Feasibility was measured by participation (number of participants enrolled/number screened), retention (number of participants attending 6/12 month study visit/number of enrolled) and self-reported adherence rates (average of mean percent adherence to each of the three intervention components). Efficacy was assessed by changes in initial weight (percent weight loss). Safety was assessed by adverse events. The mean participation rate was 42%. The retention rate was 59% at 6 and 49% at 12 months. The adherence rate for all participants (completers/dropouts/lost-to-follow-up) was 50.1% at 6 and 44% at 12 months. Completers reported adherence rates of 68% at 12 months. Study participants lost 5.3% body weight at 12 months; completers lost 9%. Only three unexpected adverse events (unrelated to the intervention) were reported. Clinically significant weight loss was observed, although retention rates were low. Findings generally support preliminary feasibility, efficacy and safety of this online weight loss programme, and future randomized control trials should be explored.",Lynch SM; Stricker CT; Brown JC; Berardi JM; Vaughn D; Domchek S; Filseth S; Branas A; Weiss-Trainor E; Schmitz KH; Sarwer DB,Obesity science & practice,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28392934/,0,0,0,0,0,1
28065180,Phenotypic factors influencing the variation in response of circulating cholesterol level to personalised dietary advice in the Food4Me study.,"Individual response to dietary interventions can be highly variable. The phenotypic characteristics of those who will respond positively to personalised dietary advice are largely unknown. The objective of this study was to compare the phenotypic profiles of differential responders to personalised dietary intervention, with a focus on total circulating cholesterol. Subjects from the Food4Me multi-centre study were classified as responders or non-responders to dietary advice on the basis of the change in cholesterol level from baseline to month 6, with lower and upper quartiles defined as responder and non-responder groups, respectively. There were no significant differences between demographic and anthropometric profiles of the groups. Furthermore, with the exception of alcohol, there was no significant difference in reported dietary intake, at baseline. However, there were marked differences in baseline fatty acid profiles. The responder group had significantly higher levels of stearic acid (18 : 0, P=0·034) and lower levels of palmitic acid (16 : 0, P=0·009). Total MUFA (P=0·016) and total PUFA (P=0·008) also differed between the groups. In a step-wise logistic regression model, age, baseline total cholesterol, glucose, five fatty acids and alcohol intakes were selected as factors that successfully discriminated responders from non-responders, with sensitivity of 82 % and specificity of 83 %. The successful delivery of personalised dietary advice may depend on our ability to identify phenotypes that are responsive. The results demonstrate the potential use of metabolic profiles in identifying response to an intervention and could play an important role in the development of precision nutrition.",Kirwan L; Walsh MC; Celis-Morales C; Marsaux CF; Livingstone KM; Navas-Carretero S; Fallaize R; O'Donovan CB; Woolhead C; Forster H; Kolossa S; Daniel H; Moschonis G; Manios Y; Surwillo A; Godlewska M; Traczyk I; Drevon CA; Gibney MJ; Lovegrove JA; Martinez JA; Saris WH; Mathers JC; Gibney ER; Brennan L,The British journal of nutrition,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28065180/,0,0,0,0,1,0
28057105,[Precision nutrition in the era of precision medicine].,"Precision medicine has been increasingly incorporated into clinical practice and is enabling a new era for disease prevention and treatment. As an important constituent of precision medicine, precision nutrition has also been drawing more attention during physical examinations. The main aim of precision nutrition is to provide safe and efficient intervention methods for disease treatment and management, through fully considering the genetics, lifestyle (dietary, exercise and lifestyle choices), metabolic status, gut microbiota and physiological status (nutrient level and disease status) of individuals. Three major components should be considered in precision nutrition, including individual criteria for sufficient nutritional status, biomarker monitoring or techniques for nutrient detection and the applicable therapeutic or intervention methods. It was suggested that, in clinical practice, many inherited and chronic metabolic diseases might be prevented or managed through precision nutritional intervention. For generally healthy populations, because lifestyles, dietary factors, genetic factors and environmental exposures vary among individuals, precision nutrition is warranted to improve their physical activity and reduce disease risks. In summary, research and practice is leading toward precision nutrition becoming an integral constituent of clinical nutrition and disease prevention in the era of precision medicine.",Chen PZ; Wang H,Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28057105/,0,0,0,0,0,0
30135822,"A personalized, multi-platform nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle coaching program: A pilot in women.","The aim of this pilot study was to examine if a personalized web-based multi-platform nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle coaching program, supported weight loss and the reduction of chronic disease risk factors in overweight or obese women. Twenty-eight women completed the program, which represented 50% of those who provided baseline data. The program consisted of a one-year curriculum with daily exercise, nutritional habits, and health behaviour lessons along with access to a one-on-one coach. The workouts, habits, and lessons were available via computer, tablet, and mobile device which, along with coaching, facilitated self-monitoring and accountability. At baseline and 12-months, weight, waist circumference, fat mass, muscle mass, blood pressure, total cholesterol, low density lipoproteins, high density lipoproteins, triglycerides, C reactive protein, and fasting glucose were collected. Over the 12 months, women who completed the program, (average age 49.64 (SD 10.99) years), lost 16.52 (SD 13.63) lbs (<i>P</i> < 0.001), and reduced waist circumference by 3.56 (SD 2.31) in (<i>P</i> < 0.0001). Diastolic blood pressure decreased by 3.77 (SD 7.25) mm Hg (<i>P</i> = 0.02) and high density lipoproteins increased by 0.16 (SD 0.28) mmol/L (<i>P</i> = 0.01). No other risk factors changed significantly. Compliance was a significant predictor of weight loss (<i>P</i> < 0.01). In conclusion, women who completed the web-based program experienced significant weight loss (8.62% of initial body weight) coming predominantly from body fat. Chronic disease risk factors also improved.",Héroux M; Watt M; McGuire KA; Berardi JM,Internet interventions,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30135822/,0,0,0,0,0,0
27873046,Commercially available lifestyle modification program: randomized controlled trial addressing heart and bone health in BRCA1/2+ breast cancer survivors after risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy.,"The goal of this RCT was to examine the efficacy and safety of a web-based program to improve cardiovascular and bone health outcomes, among 35 BRCA1/2+ breast cancer survivors who underwent prophylactic oophorectomy and thus experienced premature surgical menopause. A 12-month commercially available web-based lifestyle modification program (Precision Nutrition Coaching) was utilized. Cardiovascular fitness, dietary intake, leisure time activity, body composition, bone mineral density, bone structure, and muscle strength were assessed. Average adherence to all program components was 74.8 %. Women in the intervention group maintained their cardiovascular fitness level over the 12 months (1.1 ± 7.9 %), while the control group significantly decreased fitness capacity (-4.0 ± 7.5 %). There was a significant difference between groups in percent change of whole body bone area (-0.8 ± 2.5 control and 0.5 ± 1.30 intervention). We also observed decreased BMI (-4.7 ± 6.2 %) and fat mass (-8.6 ± 12.7 %) in the intervention group due to significant concomitant decreases in caloric intake and increases in caloric expenditure. The control group demonstrated decreased caloric intake and decreased lean tissue mass. In this population at high risk for detrimental cardiovascular and bone outcomes, a commercially available lifestyle intervention program mitigated a decline in cardiovascular health, improved bone health, and decreased weight through fat loss. Precision Nutrition Coaching has shown benefit in breast cancer survivors for reduced risk of deleterious cardiovascular and bone outcomes.",Sturgeon KM; Dean LT; Heroux M; Kane J; Bauer T; Palmer E; Long J; Lynch S; Jacobs L; Sarwer DB; Leonard MB; Schmitz K,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27873046/,0,0,0,0,1,0
19108717,Recovery from a cycling time trial is enhanced with carbohydrate-protein supplementation vs. isoenergetic carbohydrate supplementation.,"In this study we assessed whether a liquid carbohydrate-protein (C+P) supplement (0.8 g/kg C; 0.4 g/kg P) ingested early during recovery from a cycling time trial could enhance a subsequent 60 min effort on the same day vs. an isoenergetic liquid carbohydrate (CHO) supplement (1.2 g/kg). Two hours after a standardized breakfast, 15 trained male cyclists completed a time trial in which they cycled as far as they could in 60 min (AM(ex)) using a Computrainer indoor trainer. Following AM(ex), subjects ingested either C+P, or CHO at 10, 60 and 120 min, followed by a standardized meal at 4 h post exercise. At 6 h post AM(ex) subjects repeated the time trial (PM(ex)). There was a significant reduction in performance for both groups in PM(ex) versus AM(ex). However, performance and power decreases between PM(ex) and AM(ex) were significantly greater (p </= 0.05) with CHO (-1.05 +/- 0.44 km and -16.50 +/- 6.74 W) vs C+P (-0.30 +/- 0.50 km and -3.86 +/- 6.47 W). Fat oxidation estimated from RER values was significantly greater (p </= 0.05) in the C+P vs CHO during the PM(ex), despite a higher average workload in the C+P group. Under these experimental conditions, liquid C+P ingestion immediately after exercise increases fat oxidation, increases recovery, and improves subsequent same day, 60 min efforts relative to isoenergetic CHO ingestion.",Berardi JM; Noreen EE; Lemon PW,Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition,2008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19108717/,0,0,0,0,0,0
